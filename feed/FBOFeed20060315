<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service has a requirement to continue facility operation & maintenance support services at six primary entities located in Albany, California with NVT Technologies Incorporated. The contractor is required to provide work management, preventive maintenance, building maintenance, alteration and repair, installations, grounds maintenance, utilities, including heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration, electrical, plumbing; housekeeping, environmental, health and safety; and administrative services. The Contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, equipment, and materials (with the exception of those identified by the Government) for facilities operations and maintenance, administrative, security and safety support services to the Albany Research Location, including materials such as lubricants, coolants, refrigerants, chemicals and other necessary parts and supplies in providing operations and maintenance support services. At this time, it is anticipated that the current contract will be extended through July 2006.  The services are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-on contract to extend the service for the continued highly specialized services. No other offeror could immediately perform all of the required services within the timeframe and without incurring substantial cost. NVT is the only feasible source for these services because any other contractor would incur excessive projected duplicated cost and schedule risk to provide the services. The phase-in time and lead-time for new contractor personel to become minimally experienced and functional to meet the goverment requirements will result in unacceptable delays to the schedules. WRRC mission is to solve researchable food and agricultural problems of national scope.  WRRC conducts mission oriented research directed toward maintaining and improving the healthfulness and safety of the food supply, and enhancing the competitiveness and utilization of agricultural commodities through the development of new, improved plant crops, processes and products which are commensurate with sustainable agriculture and maintain or improve environmental quality.  The research program of WRRC is administered in eight research units; (a) Bioproduct Chemistry and Engineering, (b) Crop Improvement Utilization, (c) Exotic and Invasive Weeds, (d) Foodborne Contaminants Research, (e) Genomics and Gene Discovery, (f) Plant Mycotoxins Research, (g) Processed Foods Research, and (h) Produce Safety and Microbiology. The contractor is responsible for maintaining the facility in full support of the research mission. No solicitation will be issued. Questions can be emailed to lcountee@ars.usda.gov.

<DESC>Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies 57,803 rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Rockville, MD, that expires on July 31, 2009.  The Government has a requirement for an additional approximately 25,300 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.

North: Montrose Rd/Randolph Rd
South: I-495
East: Connecticut Ave.
West: I-270 

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's entire requirement for a five year term, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), plans to establish DHS department-wide contracts for Information Technology (IT) support services under the program name EAGLE. This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. Support services represent a significant portion of the DHS’s IT budget and are currently provided through a disparate collection of acquisition methods, including Component-centric contracts, task orders against General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and InterAgency Agreements.  The establishment of a consolidated portfolio of broad scope, multiple-award IT supports service contracts that are available for use throughout the Department is considered a primary ITAC objective.  The EAGLE Program will support the DHS goal of a functionally integrated Department, demanding integrated methods of operation among and between the various Components with the IT support systems that enhance mission effectiveness and create economies of scale through consolidation.  

EAGLE will provide for a wide range of IT service solutions for DHS through five comprehensive functional service categories (FC) stated here in their entirety: (FC1) Infrastructure Engineering Design, Development, Implementation, and Integration. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all phases of system design and development through deployment to ensure DHS IT solutions will enable their users to meet their mission goals and objectives. These efforts include the full range of infrastructure engineering design, development, implementation and integration, including, but not limited to, concept development, planning, requirements definition and analysis, systems design and development, integration, implementation, and deployment. (FC2) Operations and Maintenance. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all operations and maintenance (O&M) solutions, processes, and procedures necessary to sustain systems within the DHS Enterprise at the highest levels of service and availability consistent with cost, schedule, and performance objectives.  These solutions may be required across the DHS Infrastructure, to include, but not limited to, the following operational areas: Data Center, Help Desk and Field Support Services (e.g., Desk-side support and LAN Administration), Network and Security Operations, and Collaboration Services (e.g, E-mail, Voice, and Video Services).  This functional category includes the full range of O&M solutions, from maintaining and upgrading individual pieces of hardware and software to full managed service solutions.  (FC3) Independent Test, Validation, Verification, and Evaluation.  As ordered, the contractor shall provide the full range of independent test, validation, verification, and evaluation solutions to ensure that all IT products and services meet DHS standards, and are performing to defined design, cost, schedule and performance specifications/capabilities.  The contractor shall provide best practices, technologies, tools, and support to quality and operational assessments, integration testing and system test and evaluation, including security certification and accreditation, for IT systems.  The contractor shall also provide independent verification and validation through the monitoring and evaluation of projects through activities such as, but not limited to, assessments, process and procedure audits, project and performance management, and systems analysis and design.  (FC4) Software Development. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all phases of software design and development including deployment to ensure DHS applications and databases will enable their users to meet their mission goals and objectives.  These efforts include the full range of software design, development, implementation and integration, including, but not limited to, concept development, planning, requirements definition and analysis, systems design and development, coding and testing, production, deployment, implementation, integration, and software application maintenance.  (FC5) Management Support Services. The contractor shall provide, as ordered, the full range of business and technical management services that assist in the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of policies, procedures, guidelines, and directives.  These documents and guidance will allow DHS to comply with the requirements of law and legislation, and operate the enterprise in an efficient and effective manner.  These services encompasses all areas of IT policy and planning including, but not limited to, enterprise architecture, security, training, enterprise resource management, business process reengineering, IT transformation and strategy, organizational change leadership, and enterprise and program management office support (e.g. business case development and performance management).  

The contract-level service descriptions are intended to provide sufficient scope and flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements.  Specific requirements will be identified and defined at the task order level.  The EAGLE contracts will be technology neutral in order to keep pace as new technologies, standards, policies and procedures are identified. 

The EAGLE procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts. One solicitation will be issued that includes two separate and distinct source selections, one unrestricted and one set-aside for small business.  Vendors will be allowed to propose on one, any or all of the functional categories.  Source Selections for both unrestricted and set-aside contracts will be conducted at the functional service category level.  EAGLE contracts will be awarded to vendors in the functional service categories for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government.  Proposal requirements will emphasize qualifications rather than technical solutions.  The following factors will be used for award: past performance; quality awards and certifications; program management and quality control program; ability to recruit, train and retain high quality personnel; knowledge and understanding of DHS; small business participation (unrestricted track only); and pricing.  The numbers of contract awards in the functional service categories for the unrestricted and set-asides will be sufficient to maintain adequate competition for task orders at the functional services category level.  Prospective vendors are advised that only a limited number of the most highly qualified large and small business prime contractors in each functional category will be selected for award.  Vendors who do not meet that standard are strongly advised to seek subcontracting and/or mentor protege opportunities rather than submit prime contractor proposals.  

The unrestricted portion will include goals for subcontracting with Small, 8(a), Women-Owned, HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns.  If applicable, offerors will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR Part 19.  EAGLE will provide contracting opportunities for full and open competition (unrestricted), as well as set-asides for small business in all functional categories.  Proposed goals will be addressed as an evaluation factor in the selection of the unrestricted awardees.  Additionally, evaluation sub-factors will be included for prime contractor participation in the DHS Mentor-Protégé’ program and small disadvantaged business participation.  Further information regarding subcontracting and mentor-protege opportunities can be found by www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness.  The website provides a detailed description of the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program and provides an application to apply for it.  Processing time is 10 calendar days.  Teaming arrangements are also encouraged.  For the set-aside portion, only small businesses will be considered for prime contract award.  NAICS codes will be used at the Functional Category level.  The NAICS codes and size standards are as follows: (FC1) NAICS 541512 (FC2) 541513 and 811212 (FC3) 541512 (FC4) 541511 and 518210 (FC5) 541611.  The size standard for FC5 is $6M, all others are $21M.  

EAGLE contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, T&M, etc.) and will allow for various incentive contracting features.  Specific program or project requirements will be defined in task orders that will be competed at the functional service category level.  Task orders will be competed using the Fair Opportunity provisions of the FAR.  EAGLE contracts will have a five year base and two one-year option periods. Individual tasks will have their own delivery or performance period requirements and will be allowed to run up to 24 months beyond the term of the contract.  EAGLE will allow for task order performance at any location in the United States (CONUS) or outside the US (OCONUS).  IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250.  This amount is intended to provide consideration for the IDIQ award.  The scope of the contracts and the limited number of awards will provide each vendor with adequate opportunities to receive task orders.  

The Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, invites those interested in hearing senior DHS procurement and IT officials as they provide an overview of their strategies and perspectives on both Department-wide and Component initiatives. A "DHS Industry Day" is scheduled for Tuesday, August 16, 2005 from 9:00 AM - 12:00 noon at the Ronald Reagan Auditorium in Washington, DC. This event will bring together government and industry for the first DHS informational session.  To register, please visit www.actgov.org/OpenRegistration.  Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and a maximum of only two representatives from each company will be allowed. More information regarding the EAGLE and First Source programs can be found at:  www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. There is no registration fee associated with attending this event.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail confirming their attendance of the Industry Day session.  

The Industry Day will include a limited summary briefing on EAGLE. Two subsequent Pre-proposal Conferences, one of which will be limited to small businesses, will be conducted within ten calendar days of final RFP release and will be announced via FedBizOpps.  Due to the anticipated level of interest, the Contracting Officer will not entertain requests for vendor visitations or marketing calls.  

It is anticipated that the EAGLE RFP will be released in early-September 2005 with contract awards in early CY2006.  The draft EAGLE RFP is posted with this synopsis.  Written comments received at dhseagle@dhs.gov on or before August 26, 2005 will be considered for inclusion in the final EAGLE RFP, however, the Government will not issue direct responses to vendor comments or questions at this time.  

Further information regarding EAGLE, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, and vendor questions/EAGLE responses related to the final EAGLE RFP, when posted, will be released to the public through the FedBizOpps  and the DHS.gov website.  Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to dhseagle@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in anticipation of an award of contract(s) to acquire U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body (defined below) approved contraceptive implant along with the insertion device to USAID.  The base quantity is 72,000 sets.
  
A stringent regulatory authority (SRA) is a drug regulatory body that closely resembles FDA in standards utilized in its operations. Currently, countries that participate in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) are considered to have stringent regulatory authorities. The ICH regulatory bodies include: the U.S. FDA; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare; the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) centralized procedure; and the European Free Trade Area (represented by the Swiss Medic). The Canadian drug regulatory authority, the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, is an observer to the ICH and is also considered a stringent regulatory authority. Other countries may be considered to have a stringent regulatory body if they have implemented ICH guidelines and resemble the U.S. FDA in operation, but would be considered by USAID on a case-by-case basis. 

The implants supplied to USAID under this contract shall have the expiration dating approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body of 60 months (5 years).  

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract(s) resulting from this solicitation.
 
The Offeror must supply the following documentation to USAID:
(1)       Complete product description,   
(2)	evidence that the implants offered in response to this solicitation are manufactured in an ISO 9000 approved facility, 
(3)	evidence that the product and production facility have been approved by U.S. FDA or other stringent regulatory body, 
(4)	evidence that the product shelf life approved by U.S. FDA or stringent regulatory body is 5 years, 
(5)	documented proof of the date of the last U.S. FDA or other SRA inspection of their manufacturing facility,
(6)	long term stability data, 
(7)	any data to support that the product does not require climate controlled transport and storage, and
(8)	documented proof of any current registrations and in-process registrations

Products purchased under this contract are for developing countries for use in family planning programs supported by USAID and in a full range of service delivery programs.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract is 935.

Performance under the basic contract shall be from the award date on the face of the contract through December 31, 2007. Four additional option years of performance will be from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011.

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about late March 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.  The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and using the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.5.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, N68936-06-T-0071, is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The Contracts Department at Naval Air Warfare Center - Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, has a requirement to procure brand name Polycom VSX7000 Video Teleconferencing Units, 2 each.  Part number 2200-10800-001 manufacture by Polycom INC. and Module Quad BRI for VSX7000, 2 each, Part number 2215-20523-001 manufacture by Polycom INC. FOB Destination pricing only.  Questions resulting from this synopsis/solicitation must be received not later than six (6) days prior to the closin!  g date (email them to josie.babcock@navy.mil).  Offer must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offer Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, and 52.219-1 Small Business Program Representations.  The Polycom VSX7000 Video Teleconferencing Units will be installed at various locations at the Point Mugu and China Lake Ranges.  These units are replacements for the aging and failing Picturetel Venue 2000 and Picturetel 970 systems currently in place.  VTCs are used extensively in the Navair organization for cross-site and multi-site video conferencing and collaboration in an effort to reduce costs associated with travel. VTC units are inherently collaboration tools, all devices participating in the collaborative meeting must be compatible with each other.  When equipment brands and model begin to deviate, the result is always incompatibility problems and thus downtime and lost productivity.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)  intends to negotiate an award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to 
Quince Valley Informatics Inc., 12127 Sheets Farm Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878, to continue the services for the NIAMS.  The major component of the services is the development of the Microarray Data Management & Analysis System (MDMAS) and the conduction of biomedical research with computational approaches for a number of existing and related projects.  The Statement of work (SOW) is as follows: Specifically, the contractor shall: 1) continue to design, develop, and implement research and clinical databases.  This includes the continued development of MDMAS with the following substantially enhanced features: a)  Design and implement p-value, fold change, and P/A call based screening functions; b)  Design and implement functions to generate gene lists obtained under different screening criteria; c)  Design and implement functions to store GeneChip data processed by RMA (Robust Microarray Analysis), including integrating the P/A calls from MAS5. RMA is an increasingly popular algorithm for summarizing Affy’s probe level data. Since it does not consider the data from the mismatch probes, integration of the P/A calls from MAS5 is necessary to allow P/A calls based gene screening; d)  Design and implement functions to store the .cel files from the Affy system. The storage of .cel files will allow use of probe summarization algorithms other than MAS5 (Affy’s), such as RMA and PDNN, both are generally considered better than MAS5; e)  Implement Welch variance (unequal variance) in addition to the equal variance currently implemented for t-test; f) Resolve the issue related to paired t-test, implementing functions to allow a user to specify the order of samples for both sample groups; g)  Fix the deletion related bugs and implement more delete functions (currently very limited);  h)  Implement data sharing so a user can grant read and/or write privileges to group members;  i)  Implement privilege control to allow group leader/PI to group-wide access;  j)  Implement super user privileges to allow power users (experts) to analyze any user’s data; k)    Replace “rough” codings resulted from the quick-and-dirty strategy with robust and less error-prone ones; l)  Work with SITB to deploy the system to a NIH owned Unix Server and solve any porting related issues; m)  Develop a server specific backup protocol as needed; and n) Develop a user guide.  2) Design and implement biodata mining strategies, methods, and algorithms for scientific discovery; 3) Explore and evaluate database based research tools and techniques in the emerging and rapidly developing fields such as Bioinformatics, systems biology, and proteomics; 4) Provide training and educational seminars to the Intramural Research Program (IRP); 5) Provide other related databases services as needed, provide strategic and technical advise on existing  and ongoing clinical database and related projects;  6) Provide database application training to the IRP researchers; 7) Participate in the data mining projects in collaboration with other IRP investigators.  The Government will provide to the Contractor a computer system.  The Chief of Biodata Mining & Discovery section will perform quarterly reviews, inspection,  progress and approval of the work.  The acceptance of the work will be done within the last month of the contract.  Deliverables:  The Contractor shall deliver the MDMAS with the enhanced features and  the satisfactory performance to the requirements specified above.  The period of performance is for twelve (12) months beginning on the following day of the contract award date.  The place of performance is at NIH, Bethesda Maryland .  The sole source determination is based upon the continuation of the development of the MDMAS and related services initiated by Quince Valley Informatics Inc.  An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures.  It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable simplified acquisition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541690, Size Standard $6 million dollars.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, submit a statement of interest which includes a firm fixed price; documentation of similar projects conducted and the benefits in obtaining the Government’s objectives; at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government’s minimum requirements, a proposed delivery plan and meet the following technical evaluation criteria: 1) Demonstrated knowledge and understanding of the SOW as specified in this synopsis, 2) Demonstrate that the person performing this job to have experience on the related field of this project, a Ph.D. from an accredited University in the biological field, Demonstrate a minimum of five (5) years of experience on microarray database development, technical expertise with PHP - Hypertext preprocessor computer language - used specifically to develop web-interface of database, demonstrate statistical background required for microarray data manipulation, 3) proof of past performance.  The submission will be evaluated on the submission of the above documents.  The submission is due on March 30, 2006, 9:00 a.m.  The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUN’s), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offerors Business size.  The Offeror must also register in the Government’s Contractor Registry System.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), intends to procure the services of a contractor to establish an Informatics, Coordination and Service Center (ICSC) for the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRCs).  The ICSC will replace the functions of the Mutant Mouse Informatics Coordinating Center (ICC) currently funded at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME.  The ICSC will acquire all of the data from the current ICC and continue many of the previous functions as a central portal for the MMRRC program.  The ICSC will provide essential Informatics and coordinating services to the centers of the MMRRC and biomedical researchers.  These include a public website portal and Customer Service Center, to facilitate interactions with biomedical investigators, Informatics services, database activities, an archive of MMRRC documents and files, and coordination of requests to donate mouse strains to the MMRRC and order mouse strains from the MMRRC.  

Background Information:  The Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRCs) http://www.mmrrc.org/index.html/ currently consists of five collaborating institutions functioning as a single, multi-site repository to acquire and distribute genetically-engineered laboratory mice for biomedical research.  The MMRRC program is supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services.  The purpose of this program is to ensure the continued availability of scientifically valuable, genetically engineered mice, and to distribute these mice to qualified researchers studying human diseases and normal biological processes.  This national network of regional breeding and distribution centers serves as a major repository of induced and spontaneous mutant mice.  The mission of the MMRRCs is to acquire, preserve, characterize, and distribute genetically-altered mice, and information describing their characteristics, utility and other features to qualified biomedical scientists and organizations for the purpose of supporting biomedical research.  Biomedical investigators and institutions are encouraged to donate mutant mouse strains to the MMRRC.  Strains are distributed to qualified biomedical investigators in the forms of frozen embryos, spermatozoa, Embryonic Stem (ES) cell lines, or living mice for noncommercial, academic research purposes only.  A fee is charged to the requesting investigator to partially compensate the repository center for the costs of shipping and replacing the animal germplasm.  As of 2005, a total of 11,300 mutant strains are maintained.  In calendar year 2004, a total of 1,318 requests for embryos, spermatozoa, ES cell lines and mice were received.  It is expected that new NIH initiatives will increase the number of submissions and requests for MMRRC mouse strains in the next few years.

The contractor, acting as the Informatics, Coordination and Service Center (ICSC) for the MMRRC program shall perform the following:  1) Acquire all data from the currently existing Mutant Mouse Informatics Coordinating Center (ICC) at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine.  The contractor shall develop a plan to acquire all data, information and electronic files from the ICC and transfer to the contractor’s state-of-the-art website, database, and Informatics systems; 2) Provide and manage a free, public MMRRC website.  The contractor shall provide the following capabilities and information:  2A) Provide a state-of-the-art search function that allows investigators to query the catalog of MMRRC mutant mouse strains, and view, select, and order mice, cryopreserved germ plasm, and/or Embryonic Stem cell lines; 2B) Provide investigators a link to the detailed information for each MMRRC strain, including origin, utility, genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain background, colony and husbandry management, genotyping, publications in the scientific literature, licensing, availability, pricing, and links to the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Database and other public databases providing information of each strain; 2C) Provide an on-line application form accessible from the public MMRRC website that allows Donating Investigators to input information on the genetic, phenotypic and other characteristics of a strain proposed for acquisition by the MMRRC; 2D) Provide background information on the MMRRC program and links to other relevant public mouse strain databases; 3) Establish, maintain, and regularly update a central database; 4) Establish and manage a Customer Service Center.  The contractor shall provide a technical service function that can answer questions from investigators regarding the availability and ordering of strains, submission of strains, and other information in a timely manner; 5) Processing of orders for MMRRC strains; 6) Review applications from Donating Investigators of strains proposed for acquisition by the MMRRC; 7) Establish and maintain a password protected, central electronic archive of MMRRC documents, and other files; 8) Participate in the monthly teleconference of the MMRRC; 9) Participate and contribute to the MMRRC Committees, Subcommittees, and the MMRRC Annual Meeting; and 10) Develop summary statistics of the progress of the MMRRC project.

<CONTACT>CURTIS D. WILSON (505) 563-3129
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, RMK62060001, is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ) under test procedures of FAR 13.5.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition 2005-06.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541990 and the business size maximum is $6.5 Million.  This requirement is set aside for small businesses.  STATEMENT OF WORK:  This office is requesting quotes on the following item:  0001 Develop, Test, and Evaluate a Protocol of Activities and Strategies to Increase Safety Belt Use in Tribal Communities in accordance with the following Scope of Work:   BACKGROUND:    The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Division of Safety and Risk Management’s Indian Highway Safety Program (IHSP) has funded many Tribal programs and projects aimed at occupant protection through the years.  Current experiences have not generated as much success as hoped.  A sample of 18 reservations and 151 observation sites has been developed.  Preliminary survey results show safety belt use rates ranging from a low of about 9 percent to a high of 85 percent.  There is a need to develop an occupant protection program that takes into consideration the independence and differences between the Tribes but builds on tribal similarities.  To date, no one program has achieved the desired results.  A model program that the Tribes could follow would bring about the best chance for a successful project with measurable outcomes.  Though NHTSA studies show enactment or a primary law, and enforcement of that law, is the proven methodology to increase safety belt use, Native America faces challenges to this approach.  Tribal Traffic Codes – some nations have a Tribal primary law in a State with a secondary law or vice versa, some have adopted the State’s law, and others have no safety belt law.  Tribal Codes also vary by who can be cited for a violation-most only apply to Tribal members living on the reservation.  Tribal enforcement and judicial issues are complex, including authority, jurisdiction and political oversight which may make it more difficult to enforce the law and/or may incur reluctance by officers to write traffic tickets.  Tribal communities are less engaged in coordinated national, State and local safety belt enforcement campaigns such as the Operation ABC (America Buckles Up) Mobilizations, Click It or Ticket, due to a variety of factors including limited resources, limited manpower, and lack of community support for strong enforcement.  While these types of campaigns are proven to be successful in increasing safety belt use, the concept has not been fully embraced in Native America and/or traditional program delivery systems have not been able to reach the Tribal communities.  The goal of this project is to help Tribes increase safety belt and child safety seat usage rates on their respective reservations in order to lower the injury and fatality rates.  OBJECTIVE 1:  a) Research and develop a protocol of activities to be tested, in not less than two Tribal community settings, based on state of the art proven strategies; b) develop a demonstration grant solicitation in cooperation with BIA IHSP adaptable to Tribal community environments.  These demonstration projects will be funded separately by NHTSA.   OBJECTIVE 2:  Monitor, provide technical assistance, and evaluate two demonstration project sites over a two-year period.  Work with the project directors in the selected demonstration sites to a) develop their specific project action and evaluation plans, and b) develop messaging and marketing tools to use in their project implementation.  OBJECTIVE 3:  a) Provide monthly progress reports; b) provide an interim evaluation report after first year implementation of demonstration projects with results and recommended adjustments for second year to refine and further test protocol implementation; and c) Upon completion of the demonstration projects, provide a comprehensive final evaluation report with recommendations for protocol implementation/revision/replication in other Tribal communities.  OBJECTIVE 4:  Prepare a “How to” implementation guide, with recommended protocol activities for Tribal Program representatives interested in conducting effective safety belt use programs in their communities. The following resources and references contain information relevant to this demonstration project and may be located at the websites shown or by sending a fax request to NHTSA’s Communication Services Division at (202) 493-2062:  1. “Operation ABC:  America Buckles Up Children Mobilizations and Click It or Ticket,” at www.buckleupamerica.org and www.nsc.org/airbag.htm, 2. “Achieving a High Belt Use Rate:  A Guide for Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs,” at www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/research/ACHIEVE.pdf, 3. “Evaluation of Click It or Ticket Model Programs,” www.nhtsa.dot.gov./people/injury/airbags/clickit_ticket/ 4.

<DESC>The INL/A single engine eradication aircraft perform a variety of missions.  At times the aircraft operate from forward operating base locations under primitive conditions and at other times from international airports with instrument only approaches.  The primary mission is to locate and eradicate illicit narcotic producing plants.  This mission requires that the aircraft have (relative to standard production agricultural spray aircraft) exceptional range and endurance, as well as the capability to fly aerial application operations at altitudes up to 12,000 feet MSL.  Operations are often flown in very rugged mountainous terrain that requires optimum climb and turn performance at high-density altitudes.  Illicit crops are usually grown in remote areas with few bases from which to operate aircraft.  For this reason, the aircraft is required to have much greater range than standard agricultural spray aircraft.   Reconnaissance missions flown by this airframe are in the same rugged environment as the aerial eradication, but generally require even greater endurance to cover large areas of remote territory.  Further, the aircraft and crews are frequently targeted by hostile fire.  Most hits received have been from NATO ball 7.62mm (sometimes steel core armor piercing) and smaller arms.  A swath guidance system is currently installed on the fleet and is used primarily as a spray guidance system and a spray area organizational tool, but also has a secondary function as a mission recorder providing a vital database for spray analysis and mission evaluation.

INL/A is soliciting industry comments on the draft solicitation for the procurement of additional aerial eradication aircraft. Written comments may be sent to Mr. Patrick Murphy at murphypj@state.gov.  Comments are due on or before 17 Jan 06.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The goal of the “Combat ID in the Maritime Domain to Reveal Contact Intent” Program is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in Combat Identification (CID) technology that can directly enable and support enhanced Naval capabilities in the Maritime Domain to support Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), Homeland Defense (HLD) missions, Stability Operations, and Major Combat Operations (MCO).  This will be accomplished by developing appropriate technology elements (articulated in sec 6.3 “ProgramThrusts”) and integrating them in a manner that enables proof of principle demonstration of automated Level 2 and Level 3 (Level 2/3) fusion functionality  in one or more Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) scenarios or vignettes. 
 
This Program addresses current warfighter functionality shortfalls in information integration and higher levels of fusion and inference resulting from limitations in technology and reductions in staffing.  The Program will develop advanced and novel approaches for automated integration and interpretation of information from multiple (multi-INT) sensors, sources of various types including contextual descriptions.  Currently, Level 1 fusion products, principally “tracks”, represent the limit of what can be automatically known about objects and events throughout the battlespace.  Humans must derive all higher levels of relationship and inference as well as bringing in the context describing the battlespace environment.  This program will develop automated techniques to determine relationships among objects and events, in the context of relevant specific influences such as weather, terrain, topography, traffic flow, adversary doctrine, etc., as well as general influences including political, economic, and cultural factors.  The program will also develop automated techniques to interpret those relationships to understand behaviors that may have military significance, and to assess military and maritime security impact and adversary intent.  Technology articles resulting from this research will be software that is integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)  such as Composable FORCEnet (CFn) 2.0A or DCGS Infrastructure Backbone (DIB) in accordance with Net-centric Enterprise Services (NCES) and Net-centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) guidance.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to advise prospective offerors of an omission in Amendment 0001. Specifically, Amendment 0001 provides a RFP change page for Section L.8 (Page 80) in which the NAICS code list for Functional Category 2, Tier 2 Telecommunications-Related Services, only reflects NAICS 517110. This list should also include NAICS codes 517212 and 517310, as presented at the Pre-Proposal Conference and as included in the Pre-Proposal Conference slide presentation. This omission will be corrected in Amendment 0002 to be issued on or about October 24, 2005.
rocedures, guidelines, and directives. These documents and guidance will allow DHS to comply with the requirements of law and legislation, and operate the enterprise in an efficient and effective manner. These services encompasses all areas of IT policy and planning including, but not limited to, enterprise architecture, security, training, enterprise resource management, business process reengineering, IT transformation and strategy, organizational change leadership, and enterprise and program management office support (e.g. business case development and performance management).  


The single EAGLE solicitation will include two separate and distinct source selections, one unrestricted and one set-aside for small business. Source Selections for both of these evaluation tracks will be conducted at the functional service category level. Vendors will be allowed to propose on one, any or all of the functional service categories. EAGLE contracts will be awarded to vendors in the functional service categories for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government. Proposal requirements will emphasize qualifications rather than technical solutions. The following factors comprise the basis for award: past performance; quality awards and certifications; program management and quality control program; ability to recruit, train and retain high quality personnel; ability to achieve results through teaming; knowledge and understanding of DHS; small business participation (unrestricted track only); and pricing. 


Multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded to highly qualified contractors that possess the capabilities and demonstrated experience to serve as EAGLE prime contractors in one or more of the five functional service categories. The Government carefully developed evaluation criteria to identify the most highly qualified offerors which demonstrate the capability to provide, as a prime contractor, the full range of services envisioned in the respective functional category being proposed. Although the contract-level source selection will focus only on prime contractors and their experience as prime contractors, offerors are free to form teams as they see fit, particularly in the interest of providing a more definitive small business subcontracting plan. The number of contract awards resulting from the unrestricted and small business set-aside tracks will be limited to a number sufficient to maintain competition for task orders. Prospective offerors are encouraged to conduct a self assessment against the evaluation criteria to determine if they will be competitive in a functional category for either the small business set-aside or the unrestricted evaluation tracks. Prospective offerors that do not believe they will be among the most highly rated competitors should instead pursue subcontractor/teaming opportunities with the EAGLE contract awardees. Task orders will be competitively awarded for the specific work to be conducted under these functional service category contracts. In the course of task order competitions, EAGLE prime contractors will be expected to establish the best solution (and team) for the specific task order requirements. The EAGLE program will strongly encourage teaming throughout the life of the contracts.


For the set-aside portion, only small businesses will be considered for prime contract award. NAICS codes will be used at the Functional Category (FC) level. The NAICS codes and size standards are as follows: (FC1) NAICS 541512 - $21M size standard; (FC2) NAICS 517110, 541513, 811212, 518210 with an overall the size standard of 1500 employees; (FC3) 541512 - $21M size standard; (FC4) 541511- $21M size standard; (FC5) 541611 - $6M size standard.  The NAICS 541519 listed in the general information section of this synopsis was selected for announcement purposes only because of its breadth of coverage.  


The unrestricted portion will require offerors to include goals for subcontracting with small business concerns. As applicable, offerors will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR Part 19. Proposed subcontracting goals will be addressed as an evaluation factor in the selection of the unrestricted awardees. Additionally, evaluation sub-factors will be included for prime contractor participation in the DHS Mentor-Protege program and small disadvantaged business participation. Further information regarding subcontracting and mentor-protege opportunities can be found by www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. The website provides a detailed description of the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program and provides an application to apply for it. Processing time is ten (10) calendar days.  



EAGLE contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, T&M, etc.) and will allow for various incentive contracting features. Specific program or project requirements will be defined in task orders that will be competed at the functional service category level. Task orders will be competed using the Fair Opportunity provisions of the FAR. EAGLE contracts will have a five year base and two one-year option periods. Individual tasks will specify delivery or performance period requirements that may run up to 24 months beyond the term of the contract. EAGLE will allow for task order performance at any location in the United States (CONUS) or outside the US (OCONUS). IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250. This amount is intended to provide consideration for the IDIQ award. The scope of the contracts and the limited number of IDIQ contract awards will provide each vendor with adequate opportunities to receive task orders. 


A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on October 13, 2005 in the U.S. Department of Commerce Auditorium at 14th and Constitution Ave, Washington, DC. The conference is expected to last approximately one hour and will be limited to a review of the RFP proposal requirements. No technical or strategic topics will be discussed. Attendance is not mandatory. Multiple sessions may be held, depending upon the volume of interest. Registration is required. Registration details will be provided on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) and www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness on October 3, 2005. Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and a maximum of only two representatives from each company will be allowed. Please do not send registration requests to the DHS EAGLE email address. 


Due to the anticipated level of interest, the ITAC will not entertain requests for contractor visitations or marketing calls. All RFP questions shall be submitted in writing via email to dhseagle@dhs.gov and must include a reference to the RFP section, paragraph, and page number.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "DRAFT" ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY:  MARS SCOUT AND MISSION OF OPPORTUNITY which was posted on January 9, 2006.  To all Mars Scout Proposers - Thank you for your comments on the draft Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for 2006.  We anticipate that the final AO will be released in April 2006, and look forward to your proposals in response to the AO. While we prepare the final AO for release, we would like to bring one important correction to your attention.  The draft AO gave conflicting, inconsistent information about whether the cost cap was in Real Year or Fiscal Year dollars.  The cost cap and phasing was provided correctly in Appendix E in Real Year dollars, but was incorrectly stated elsewhere in the AO as Fiscal Year 2006 dollars. The correct cost cap for this Mars Scout AO is anticipated to be $475M in REAL YEAR (RY) dollars, and the desired phasing will be provided in Appendix E in REAL YEAR dollars. Likewise, the anticipated Mission of Opportunity cost cap ($35M) is in REAL YEAR dollars.  We will ensure the final AO is clear and consistent on this matter.  We regret any confusion this inconsistency may have caused, but wanted to ensure potential bidders were aware of this as early as possible. Any questions or comments may be addressed to Dr. Michael Meyer, Mars Program Lead Scientist, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546; Telephone 202-358-0307; E-mail Michael.A.Meyer@nasa.gov.

<DESC>This announcement amends NRL-Wide BAA05-01 posted on Dec 30, 2004 by revising topic BAA 82-05-01
SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGY to include a request for proposals for technologies to support the Advanced Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) Program. The goal of this program is to determine whether a generational leap of smaller and lighter Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) can be made by taking advantages of the ability to operate at higher speeds based on recent advances in (1) hybrid ball bearings, (2) advanced rotor materials, and (3) ironless armature motors.  Additionally, to be viable these advanced CMGs should exhibit minimal induced vibration.  It is also desirable to minimize power consumption but it is recognized that power consumption may need to be compromised and slightly higher than existing CMGs. 
The further information on this topic as well as the complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions,
technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria is available at

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management has an interest and is requesting information from sources capable of providing fitness center access in accordance with the Statement of Work provided below.  This is a Request for Information only.  

Fitness Center Access Statement of Work
OPM Healthier Worksite Initiative – March 2005

I.	Background and Need

OPM’s work/life program is designed to assist OPM employees in balancing the demands of work and family responsibilities which ultimately results in a healthier and more productive workplace.  On-going OPM initiatives include: Childcare Subsidy program, on-site health unit, Health Fair, Alternate Work Schedule, Telecommuting, on-site Employee Assistance Program, Legal and Financial Services, and periodic and health and wellness programs.  

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in health/wellness at the worksite, especially among younger employees who are motivated to develop healthy lifestyles.  Employees throughout OPM have begun to ask about the availability of health/wellness opportunities, including access to on-site fitness centers.  

One solution to increasing fitness center access for all employees is to provide an ongoing opportunity to join a nearby fitness center through a service that maintains a nationwide fitness center network by negotiating with chain and individual fitness clubs to provide reduced rates and membership flexibility to individual employees.    This strategy for fitness center access is consistent with OPM’s guidance for providing physical fitness programs.   Employees working at OPM sites that lack a nearby joint-use worksite fitness center, such as many non-DC locations, are especially likely to benefit from such a service.  In addition, employees who travel frequently or are detailed to other locations are also likely to use this service, if it offers an option to “freeze” a membership at the person’s primary club and issues free guest passes to network clubs throughout the U.S.  

II.	Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to increase fitness center access to OPM employees nationwide, thereby reducing a cost barrier to regular physical activity for employees and their families.  Our objective is to provide this access, at no cost to OPM, through an experienced company that has a well-established nationwide fitness center network, to which it offers membership discounts and flexibility to employees of companies/agencies that contract for these services.


III.	Scope of Work
A.	Contractor Responsibilities - The contractor will be responsible for negotiating with and maintaining a nationwide network of at least 1500 chain and individual fitness clubs to provide reduced rates for OPM employees and their families, pursuing additions to their network as needed in locations where there are OPM employees, enrolling OPM employees who submit membership applications, providing an on-line registration and employee information/communication system, providing OPM with all promotional materials, handling all membership, billing and network administrative duties, assisting with program promotion and providing OPM with aggregate membership data.  There will be no charge to OPM for these services.  The contractor is expected to provide written references and contacts from employers who use their services.

<DESC>UPDATE MARCH 15, 2006:  This synopsis modification summarizes changes to be made as a result of the presolicitation conference that was held on Monday, March 6, 2006.  The planned revisions are intended to simplify the solicitation and ensure consistency with commercial practices.  The requirement to schedule construction work around Party in the Plaza community concerts has been eliminated due to the event’s expected relocation to the back lawn of the Hanley building.  In addition, the sculpture removal, rehabilitation and relocation will be performed under a separate contract.  The technical proposal requirements also will be streamlined in recognition of the revised approach.  The required completion date will be May 15, 2007 based on an estimated award date of May 22, 2006 and estimated Notice to Proceed date of August 1, 2006.  The solicitation is expected to be available on the secured website on March 22, 2006.


UPDATE FEBRUARY 23, 2006:  A presolicitation conference and site visit will be conducted on Monday, March 6, 2006, 10:15 am, in Room 541 at the James M. Hanley Federal Building, Syracuse, New York.  Additional organized site visits are not anticipated; therefore all potential offerors are strongly encouraged to attend.  Vendors planning to bring a camera to the site visit must first check in with the Security Office located in Room 105.  To facilitate active participation and dialogue at the presolicitation conference, advanced access to the specifications and drawings is now available at https://projectpoint.buzzsaw.com/gsapbsr2 using the login information provided to vendors that submitted a Document Security Notice.  The file entitled Additional Specification Information contains necessary changes to the specifications and drawings after publication.

A significant feature of the work will be to convert much of the currently paved area to a lawn surface.  Work will be conducted during the 2006 construction season.  A significant phasing effort will be required by the Contractor to eliminate disruptive work in the main portion of the plaza from approximately May 10, 2006 through August 31, 2006.  This is necessary to accommodate the schedule for “Party in the Plaza” community concerts.  The magnitude of this construction project is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 and the size standard is $31.0 million.  Performance and payment bonds will be required following award pursuant to the Miller Act.  A bid guarantee is also required.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  Offers from other than small business concerns will not be considered.  All responsible small business sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The required construction completion date is 365 days commencing one day after the notice to proceed.  The tentative solicitation release date is no earlier than 15 days after posting of this notice in FedBizOpps.  The solicitation will require separate pricing and technical proposals.  This solicitation incorporates documents which are not available electronically on the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE).  Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file.  The solicitation, amendments to the solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available through a secured Internet site.

Contractors will also be required to sign a Document Security Notice which at a minimum must include a street address, telephone number, business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business, valid DUNS number, valid IRS Tax ID Number and e-mail address.  Once the request for the solicitation has been accepted, one e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address provided.

Defense Supply Center Richmond

**DSCR intends to add four more additional FSCs to the privatization initiative:
6810-Reagent & Technical Grade; 6820 – Dyes; 6840 – Pesticides, Disinfectants, Repellents, Deodorants; 6850 - Compounded Chemicals.  Please advise of any changes to your response to the RFI by COB 3/21/06.


PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, DLA uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ hazardous material needs.  DLA’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry and implement regional chemical management services programs across the U.S.  This initiative is designed to assure readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DLA’s goal is to improve lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

Anticipated Scope of Services:

Forecasting collaboration with customers - Accurately predicting future customer requirements/demand patterns.

Procurement/Purchasing - All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.

Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing - The direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.

Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include disposal) – To provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe and occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.

Customer Direct - Ship directly to joint warfighter customers across a broad spectrum of locations both CONUS and potentially OCONUS.  Deliver items using shipping methods defined by terms and conditions of the contract (i.e. required delivery date, packaging requirements, delivery address, special instructions for emergency or other needs).  Track the delivery of items. 

Data Management - to include interoperability with industry and government systems.


RFI Questions

1)	Forecasting
A)	In your opinion, what is the best way to collaborate forecasting with the customers?
B)	Do you see a need for DLA involvement in this process?  If so, how?
  
2)	Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing
A)	What is your concept for the Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing requirements to support this effort? 
B)	What is your view on how to best handle inventory management?  (customer direct delivery vs. storage) 
C)	How would you recommend the Bill Of Materials to be set up? (i.e. Do you envision multiple contracts per Federal Supply Class)?  Should the Petroleums, Oils, & Lubricants (9150s) be combined with the Compressed Gases and Cylinders (6830s and 8120s) or should we solicit and award separate contracts for each of the FSCs? 
D)	If Government packaging and/or marking requirements could be made more efficient by being more like commercial practices, what would those changes be and what efficiencies would potentially be gained?  If possible, rank the changes in order of their potential benefit and/or provide some indication of the significance from a cost perspective.

3)	Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health
A)	Describe your current protocols, systems, and procedures as well as reports, from material procurement through ultimate product disposal, that reflect and ensure compliance with Federal (i.e. OSHA, DOT, EPA), State, and Local regulations proper to materials defined to be hazardous by one or more regulatory bodies.
B)	ESOH, Transportation, Logistics as well as Contracting information proper to assets that are defined to be hazardous (FED STD 313) is maintained in a federal database identified as the Hazardous Materials Information Resource System (HMIRS).  Government employees (civilian and military) utilize this database to obtain necessary ESOH and Transportation information on assets proper to the execution of their respective missions/tasks. DSCR is the functional manager of the HMIRS. Describe the procedures/methodologies, etc., of how you would obtain, identify and then provide the correct Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and other pertinent information to DLA Point of Contact/HMIRS so as to reflect vendor – manufacturer relationship, etc. for the asset(s) delivered to a customer/requisitioner. 
C)	Describe your capabilities/resources to certify packages containing hazardous materials for transport via surface (highway & rail), water, and air subject to either domestic (DOT) or military (AF-JMAN 24-204) or international (IMDG or IATA) regulations.

4)	Customer Direct Delivery
A)	Describe your concept for providing CONUS customer direct delivery support, i.e. regionally or state.  In addition, and if required, could you support OCONUS (overseas) requirements?

A) What type of data systems do you currently use and do you see any concerns with integrating your IT systems with other industry partners and government agencies?

6)	General Business Information
A)	Which services listed above do you envision being able to provide – all or a portion?  Are there any other services that you think the Government should include in this effort that are not mentioned in the introduction?
B)	If your company is considered a Small Business under the proposed NAICS codes (324191, 325120), do you foresee any impediments in support of this initiative? 
i.	Does your company qualify in any sub-category?  (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB)
C)  Do you consider an effort of this magnitude to be best suited for a cost-basis contract or firm-fixed contract and what is the maximum number of years you would recommend for the total life of the contract?
D)  What do you envision as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate those risks?
E)	What would be your proposed solution to support this effort? (Contracts by region, by state, by customer)?  If regional contracts, how many?  What would be your vision of a back up plan if another prime contractor fails to perform?  

7)	Miscellaneous
A)	Please provide any additional feedback you feel is relevant to this initiative.

<DESC>PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE LOGCAP-IV AND LOGCAP PLANNING/SUPPORT Contracting Office Address U.S. Army Field Support Command, ATTN: AMSFS-CCF, Rock Island, IL 61299-6500 Description The HQ U.S. Army Field Support Command is holding a pre-proposal conference to receive Industry interest and feedback on the acquisition strategies under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) as outlined in draft solicitations W52P1J-06-R-0049 for LOGCAP-IV and W52P1J-06-R-0072 for LOGCAP Planning/Support.   The Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on March 29 and March 30, 2006.  March 29 the W52P1J-06-R-0049 LOGCAP-IV solicitation will be the focus and March 30 the focus will be on W52P1J-06-R -0072 LOGCAP Planning/Support.   Please submit any questions that you may have which need to be addressed to the undersigned POCs in advance of the conference so that as many questions as possible can be addressed in advance of the conference itself.  All questions and their respective answers will be posted at   http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc for viewing by all interested parties. LOGCAP is a program of the U.S. Army to use civilian contractors to provide the U.S. troops with an additional means to adequately support the current and programmed force by performing selected services in wartime and other operations, i.e. Humanitarian A ssistance, Disaster Relief, Peace Keeping, Peace Enforcement, and Major/Minor Conflict. The principal objective of LOGCAP is to provide Combat Support and Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) augmentation to Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Army Service Compon ent Commanders (ASCCs) (COCOM/ASCC), primarily during COCOM contingency operations, throughout the full range of military operations to include reconstitution and replenishment, within reasonable cost.   LOGCAP services have been authorized by the Departme nt of the Army for use in supporting other military services, coalition and/or multinational forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies. Contractors must be able to obtain a U.S Facility Clearance to the SECRET level in accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5220.22 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) due to the requirement to work wit h classified information.

<DESC>HQ, U.S. Army Field Support Command has issued a Draft Request for Proposal W52P1J-06-R-0072 under LOGCAP to solicit industry comments and it can be found at http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/.  A pre-solicitation conference is planned for 30 Marc h 2006 at the Rock Island Arsenal. A Sources Sought announcement for Planning/Support was issued on 4 November 2005 under the solicitation number W52P1J-06-R-0049.  That solicitation number is now reserved for the LOGCAP IV program execution solicitation.  The Planning and Support solicitat ion will now be W52P1J-06-R-0072.  Under this proposed LOGCAP IV acquisition strategy, instead of awarding all LOGCAP planning, support, and program execution worldwide to a single contractor, we intend to award contracts for LOGCAP program execution to multiple contractors, with a separate  single contract for LOGCAP worldwide and regional planning and program support. Solicitation W52P1J-06-R-0049 shall be for the execution portion of the LOGCAP IV program. Solicitation W52P1J-06-R-0072 shall be for the planning and support portion of the L OGCAP IV program.    The principal objective of LOGCAP IV Contract is to provide combat support and combat service support (CS/CSS) augmentation to Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Army Service Component Commanders (ASCCs) throughout the full range of military operations.   L OGCAP services are also available to support military services, coalition and/or multi-national forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies. Each execution contractor would be required to execute logistics support in all types of environments on multiple task orders, simultaneously, in support of several dozen to tens of thousands of troops per task order in the general areas of Supply, Field Services, and Other Operations/Services. A Draft Request for Proposal W52P1J-06-R-0049 has already been  released and may be viewed at http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/. The LOGCAP Planning and Support contractor will support multiple selected LOGCAP IV contractors in a variety of logistics planning actions. The primary support is to document the LOGCAP Worldwide Management and Staffing Plan (WMSP), regional plans, and int egrate that planning with LOGCAP IV contractors and theater planners.   The LOGCAP Planning and Support contractor will provide non-inherently Governmental functions of: independent analysis and assistance in evaluating Performance Work Statements (PWS), Task Order proposals, cost analysis, and financial analysis.  The contrac tor will also provide assistance with preparation of Independent Government Cost Estimates (IGCE), lessons learned documents, business process improvements, and other acquisition management tasks. The contractor will be required to support combatant commanders with resident LOGCAP planners in theater.  Those personnel will be required to become familiar with theater contingency logistics support requirements.  The support contractor will also partic ipate in the requirements definition process with the Government and performing contractors.  The support contractor will also be required to deploy into contingency situations to accomplish initial planning and validation of theater requirements. It is anticipated that the RFP will result in a five (5) year IDIQ contract, with one base year and four (4) option years.  The contract includes a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure that supports Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), and Time and Material (T&M) contract elements. To preclude possible conflicts of interest, the LOGCAP support contractor cannot be a LOGCAP IV prime contractor or subcontractor or one of their affiliates.  The support contractor will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements with the LOGCAP IV cont ractors for access to their proprietary information.   Since the support contractor will be working with classified operational plans, they must meet National Industrial Seefore the overpass turn right and follow the Moline Bridge ramp to the Arsenal.

INVENTION SUMMARY:

INL has filed a patent application on a conceptual analytical centrifuge design for use in crude oil testing.  It combines centrifugal force with microwave irradiation to rapidly break emulsions and dispersions containing oil, water and solids.  Conventional techniques for this analysis requires the use of expensive, and time consuming, heated centrifuges or dilution of the heavy oil sample with lighter solvents to obtain faster results. This device would reduce analysis time for heavy oil samples by a factor of three and lower equipment costs when compared to a thermally heated device.  It would also preclude the need for dilution; thus reducing costs, hazards, and waste volumes.  Nominal funding is needed to build a prototype and demonstrate proof of concept.

<DESC>REPAIR ROOFS – SINGLE PLY PVC.

Sources Sought Synopsis Only.

McChord AFB is seeking potential sources for a roofing system that meets all the salient characteristics listed in this advertisement. Interested parties who believe their product meets all specified criteria are asked to submit a UL Certificate Number & FM Assembly Number as evidence documenting compliance with this advertisement. 

Respondents are asked to provide their documents via email to the point of contact listed in this advertisement within 15 calendar days of this posting. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Installation of a new single-ply membrane over existing corrugated metal roofs on various buildings at McChord AFB, WA.  Design required installation of 60-mil (0.060 inch) single-ply roofing membrane utilizing a fiberglass reinforced, thermoplastic roof membrane (polyvinyl chloride - PVC compound) fully-adhered over mechanically-fastened reinforced gypsum recover board installed over existing corrugated steel panels.  

ROOF MEMBRANE SPECIFICATION:  ASTM D 4434-04 ‘Standard Specification for Polyvinyl Chloride Sheet Roofing’, Type-II, Grade-1 is the governing standard which the PVC membrane must adhere to per Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS) Section 07548 ‘Polyvinyl Chloride Roofing’.  This specification covers flexible sheet made from polyvinyl chloride resin as the primary polymer intended for use in single-ply roofing membranes exposed to the weather.  The membrane sheet shall contain reinforcing fibers (Fiberglass, Type-II, 
Grade-1) to incorporate increased dimensional stability and puncture resistance.

FIRE RESISTANCE:  Roofing membrane to be rated Class-A as determined by UL 790 ‘Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Roof Coverings’ OR Class-1 as determined by Factory Mutual (FM) Class number 4470.  FM utilizes ASTM E-108 ‘Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Roof Coverings’ for their fire testing criteria.  Both tests (UL 790 and ASTM E-108) have similar testing characteristics and are considered equivalent for approval purposes.  Both tests utilize a maximum roof slope of 5:12 (5 vertical inches per horizontal 12 inches) as the maximum incline, with the severity of the test exposure decreasing as the slope of the test deck decreases below 5:12.  For test purposes, anything classified as 5:12 or greater is considered ‘Unlimited’ slope.  Compliance of each component of the roofing system shall be evidences by label or by written certification from the manufacturer.  This criteria is dictated by Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-600-01 ‘DESIGN: Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities’ (17 Apr 03), para 2-8.1 Roof Coverings, which states the following:  “Use roof coverings approved and listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory (NRTL).  The Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) Roofing Materials and Systems Directory lists three (3) Classes (A, B, and C) of acceptable roof coverings based on compliance with UL 790 and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 256 ‘Fire Tests of Roof Coverings’.  Restrict Class-C roof coverings to housing and buildings under 8,000 sf and that are not mission essential.”  Para 2.8.2 states the following:  “Roof Deck Assemblies:  Roof deck assemblies must be FM Class-1 approved, or UL listed as Fire Classified, or equal listing or classification by an NRTL.” 

WIND UPLIFT:  Roofing assembly to be rated Class 1-90 in accordance with Factory Mutual (FM) Approval number 4474 or Class 90 in accordance with UL 580.  The ‘90’ is in reference to 90 pounds per square foot (psf) of negative air pressure occurring immediately above the roof surface resulting in forces lifting the membrane off the roof deck.  FM wind uplift testing criteria are performed with the most restrictive exposure (i.e. flat roof) and that any increase in pitch (slope) does not negatively impact the FM wind uplift test results.  Wind Uplift becomes the most critical (worst case) when the roof is flat or very low slope.  Tested membranes either meet FM 1-90 or they don’t, regardless of the roof slope (there is no variable due to increased slope).  Class 1-90 will ensure proper adherence of roof membrane and prevent blow-off during excessive windstorms known to occur in Puget Sound.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families, Division of Child and Family Development, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management is providing the following sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) to conduct the work necessary to  continue the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW).  NSCAW is the first nationally representative, longitudinal study to examine in detail the outcomes for those children and families that come into contact with the child welfare system and to identify key variables that contribute to those outcomes.  Currently, the NSCAW project is being conducted through a contract to RTI International; begun in 1997, the project has conducted four waves of data collection from a sample of 5501 children, drawn from 92 primary sampling units (PSUs) across the U.S.,  who were the subjects of investigation by Child Protective Services between late 1999 and early 2001 for reports of maltreatment.   An additional sample of 727 children was selected from those who had been in foster care for one year during the sample enrollment period, in the same PSUs.  Data were collected at baseline and at three follow-up waves (12 months, 18 months, and 36 months post-investigation).  A fifth wave of data collection will be completed in 2006.  Further information about the NSCAW project can be found at http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/opre/abuse_neglect/nscaw/index.html . 

The NSCAW work will be conducted over a five-year period.  The contractor is expected to manage all aspects of the study, including completing the study design, defining the sample, defining constructs and measures, preparing documents for obtaining approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for data collection, obtaining approvals from internal and external Internal Review Boards (IRBs), and assessing the feasibility of proposed field work strategies.  The contractor shall complete preparations for field work (including obtaining cooperation from 100 local child welfare agencies for participation and training an extensive field staff), recruit and train field staff, locate families, obtain informed consent, and conduct data collection.  The contractor shall be responsible for locating and tracking a national sample of approximately 5000-6000 children over the course of the study’s designated time period using a variety of data collection methods and will revise the design and measures as appropriate at each data collection point, complete data analyses, and prepare the data from each data collection for archiving as public use data sets.  Data analysis will include state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical models, growth curve analysis, structural equation modeling, attrition models, and survival models.  The contractor shall report their findings to policy, science and practice communities, including publishing in professional journals and presenting at professional meetings.

The contract will require longitudinal data collection from (1) children in the child welfare system, (2) their caregivers, (3) their caseworkers, (4) other agency personnel, and (5) review of administrative records.  It is expected that at a minimum, two rounds of face-to-face interviews will be conducted with children, caregivers, and caseworkers.  In addition to interviews, standardized assessments of educational, emotional, behavioral, and social functioning will be conducted with children.  Data may also be collected from schools and from service providers outside the child welfare system.  In addition to the face-to-face interviews noted above, other activities may be used as supplements to the interview data or to facilitate data collection at more frequent intervals (including telephone follow-ups, mailed questionnaires, record reviews).  Careful tracking of families and children over time to minimize attrition is an essential component for the success of this study.

Participating children and families will be those who have had contact with the child welfare system (i.e., upon investigation of abuse or neglect or some other entry mechanism into the system).  Obtaining child welfare agency participation is likely to present substantial challenges.  Local agencies are highly variable in terms of the resources that they have available for participation in research activities, the policies and procedures that govern whether they will agree to participate, whether they will allow and facilitate access to the children and families served by the system, and as to what type of consent procedures are required for child and family participation.  The availability of staff or consultants with extensive knowledge of state and local child welfare agencies will be necessary to facilitate this process.  Likewise, obtaining participation from an extremely high-risk and vulnerable group of children and families, will require considerable skill and resources.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  The minimum contractor requirements are:  (1) In-depth expertise of the issues related to the child welfare population, including issues around service delivery, service integration, child development, and family functioning, and extensive knowledge of state and local child welfare agencies; (2) expertise in sampling and survey research, as well as several of the following areas: research or evaluation study design and implementation, including experience conducting large, multi-site, longitudinal national studies; experience in working on research or evaluation projects that focus on program outcome assessment issues, as well as educational and social service programs which address these outcome issues;  3) capacity to collect data at multiple timepoints for as many as 20,000 respondents, spread over as many as 100 separate locations across the nation; experience conducting on-site research in social service settings; experience conducting on-site interviews with program staff and parents, as well as experience conducting in-depth and comprehensive assessments of children and families from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations; research experience entailing social services data collection strategies; 4) experience with the analysis and integration of data with varying levels of quality from multiple sources; expertise in using state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical models, growth curve analysis, structural equation modeling, attrition models, survival models; expertise in demography and the analysis of population distributions; writing reports for both a research and policy making audience; and report preparation; 5) expertise related to multi-site, longitudinal research methodology including the statistical approaches and issues related to analyzing very large (and sometimes incomplete) multi-site data sets and expertise related to outcome assessment issues associated with child welfare and related programs, as well as demographic and service delivery trends affecting this population; (6) experience managing a national data collection effort that requires participation by multiple local agencies and expertise in identifying the ethical and legal issues that may arise in the course of collecting data on high risk populations, and the skills and resources required to address such issues;  availability of an internal IRB to review the data collection plan, as well as experience in dealing with obtaining approvals from multiple external IRBs at the state and local level;  (7) experience in designing data collection strategies, including expertise in selecting data collection strategies from among the various alternatives, based on theoretical and methodological support for each specific data collection strategy (e.g., psychometric issues, previous use of techniques, and relevance for the population from low-income backgrounds and from multiple cultural and linguistic groups); (8) adequate computer/statistical resources, including ability to use CAPI and CATI data collection technologies, access to internet, and the institutional capacity to process, analyze and archive all data, including the capability to support the performance of state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques; (9) capability to conduct large-scale  training programs to prepare field interviewers to conduct direct assessments of children from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations; (10) experience in the recruitment, training, supervision and management of nationally dispersed field staff, particularly in the areas of client interviewing and child assessments;  demonstrated capacity for efficient data collection and quality control associated with multi-site longitudinal studies; ability to quickly mobilize a national cadre of skilled data collectors; experience collecting, processing and analyzing large quantities of data; experience preparing data sets for public use; and preparing written reports for Federal, State, and local agencies; and (11) expertise in collecting, analyzing, and reporting information for purposes of successful dissemination to science and practice communities, including publishing in professional journals and presenting at professional meetings;  and 12) experience with documenting and archiving data sets for secondary analysis, knowledge and expertise in the confidentiality issues surrounding data archiving, and experience with end-user technical assistance in accessing and using complex data sets.

The contractor must have an accounting system adequate to support a cost-reimbursement type contract.  

Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email by March 22, 2006, 3:00pm local prevailing time, to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address: snamoski@psc.gov and pscacquisitions@psc.gov, reference 06Y009114.

<SUBJECT>V--8006-34 Provide Fully Contractor Operated and Maintained Air Attack Services in Support of the BLM Aerial Task Force, Designated Base, Phoenix, AZ.
<SOLNBR>8006-34
<RESPDATE>032006
<ARCHDATE>03152007
<CONTACT>Tina Young Contracting Officer 2084335021     ;
<DESC>1.	Objective: To obtain fully contractor operated and maintained Type I air attack services in support of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Aerial Task Force (ATF) Due to the extraordinarily high fire danger in the Southwestern United States and the anticipated severe fire season, the BLM is assembling an Aerial Task Force to be available for rapid respond to multiple fires. The ATF will consist of three Single Engine Attack Tankers (SEATs) in addition to this air attack aircraft. The ATF will be used for a sixty day period, April 1, 2006 through May 30, 2006 with an option to extend services as provided under the Terms and Conditions below. The ATF will not be assigned to a designated base, but will report to and be released from Phoenix, AZ. No payment will be made for mobilization to and from Phoenix, AZ. Once contractor reports to Phoenix, AZ, subsistence, availability, and flight time will be paid for the duration of this agreement. The BLM will determine the locations where the ATF will be dispatched, based upon current fire conditions. We anticipate the ATF being dispatched to areas with the most critical fire activity/conditions. 2. Terms and Conditions a.	Aircraft Rental Agreement (ARA) The resulting contract will be awarded by the issuance of a modification to the operator's Aircraft Rental Agreement.  Terms and conditions for that agreement including all of Supplement 15 Type I Air Attack, shall apply unless otherwise specified herein.  Operators that do not currently have an Aircraft Rental Agreement must be capable of meeting the requirement of this agreement.  The agreement can be found at www.oas.gov under the flight coordination center.  Information concerning the agreement can be obtained from Aviation Management at 208-334-9310. b.	Exclusive Use Period The exclusive use period shall start on either (1) the date stipulated in Section 4 below, or (2) the effective date established by a Notice to Proceed issued by the CO or COR, 10 days in advance of the start date  (The effective date established by a Notice to Proceed shall not commence more than 14 days prior to nor 14 days after the date stipulated in Section 4), or (3) the date determined according to the following paragraph. c.	Mutual Extension of Exclusive Use Period Upon mutual agreement by the parties, the CO will modify the contract to extend the exclusive use period on a day-to-day basis, either prior to the established starting date or subsequent to the ending date. The contract terms, conditions, specifications and prices shall apply to such extension. d.	Daily Availability During the exclusive use period and any extension, the Contractor shall be in compliance with all contract requirements and available and capable of providing service up to 14 hours each day, as scheduled by the Government.  Personnel shall be available a minimum of nine hours each day, or as scheduled by the Government.  Pre- and post-flight activities shall be accomplished within the 14- hour duty day.  Routine maintenance shall be performed before or after the scheduled 14-hour period, or as permitted elsewhere in the contract. The government will pay daily availability at the rate and for the number of days set forth in Section 4 below.   Payment for availability will be made as actual services are provided.   Payment will be reduced for each hour, or portion thereof in accordance with the Unavailability Conversion Chart Exhibit when services are unavailable or when the aircraft has been released for the Contractor's benefit.   e.	Unavailability and Damages  The contractor will be unavailable when not in compliance with all contract requirements, or is not capable of providing service as scheduled by the government. Unavailability will continue until the contractor has notified the COR that they are available.    During periods of unavailability, the Government may obtain replacement services elsewhere and charge the Contractor for any resulting excess costs.  The Contractor may be liable for any additional actual damages to the Government resulting from such failure to perform.  f.  Extended Standby Extended standby is intended to provide the Contractor compensation for employee time when ordered services are provided in excess of the first 9 hours of service.  Ordered standby shall not exceed individual crewmembers' daily duty limitations.  Extended standby is not intended to compensate the Contractor on a one-to-one basis for all hours necessary to service and maintain the aircraft.   The Government will measure extended standby in full hours and will round up to the next whole hour, not to exceed each crewmember's duty limitations specified in Section B of the ARA.  Payment for extended standby will be made at the prices set forth in Section 4 below, and as measured above.  If unavailability occurs, extended standby will be measured and paid only for full hours of service provided. 3.

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement for the following: 1) Failure Scene Investigation Training from April 4 thru April 7 2006 as specified below:  (statement of work follows)
The Maintenance Branch at Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center (ELC 017), under Maintenance Logistics 21 (ML21), has the responsibility for implementation and management of a Coast Guard wide Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) program to effectively manage its naval engineering maintenance program. This program supports the goal of achieving a clearly delineated standardized maintenance program that is sustainable, and supports continuous improvement. The objective of this project plan is to establish procedures and guidelines for gathering information and conducting Root Cause Failure Analysis when mechanical malfunctions occur on Coast Guard equipment and systems. It is generally felt that by analyzing the most predominate and costly failures that increased reliability and cost avoidance can be achieved. ELC is tasked with organizing, training for and implementing this program.
SCOPE: The contractor will conduct Failure Scene Investigation Training to MLCA personnel.  This comprehensive 4 day hands-on workshop in analysis verification techniques provides the participants with the skills and knowledge to strategically obtain and interpret the data necessary to solve failure by demonstrating how different analytical tools are used to prove or disprove hypotheses.  Upon completion of this course the participants will be able to develop thorough and accurate data collection strategies that will uncover the order and pattern that lead to failure.  Participants will have the ability to recognize different failure patterns and mechanisms and determine what verification techniques are applicable in the context of an overall approach to Root Cause Failure Analysis.
DELIVERABLES: The Training course shall cover the following topics: Rotor dynamics, NDT Techniques, Tribology, Fractology, Corrosion Types and Mechanisms , Human Performance Failure Developing Data Collection Strategies, Verification Techniques, Reviewing mechanical failures of fasteners, gears, shafts, bearings, belts, couplings, etc. 
Once the Failure Scene Investigator has determined the root cause(s) of the failure mechanism, he or she is then taught how to write a report that will accurately articulate his or her findings. The final report provides the necessary evidence to obtain the resources needed to implement solutions to proven root cause(s) - effectively convicting the criminal (failure).
This advanced course is designed for field, technical and engineering personnel who are primarily responsible for determining the causes of equipment, process and human failures, or for providing input on failed parts and general data collection when failure occurs.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance will be from April 4, 2006 through April 7, 2006.
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: The tasks included in this order shall be performed at facilities provided by the Coast Guard.
TRAVEL: As part of this task, it is anticipated that local travel in the Norfolk/ Portsmouth, VA area will be required to conduct the training session. Travel to the cutters may be required for training
SECURITY CLEARANCE: The work will not be classified.  No security clearance is required.  Release of information generated for the Coast Guard shall not be allowed without prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. (end of statement of work)

Parts or components in an “as removed” condition will not be installed in the assemblies.  Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an “over-and-above.”  Since the Government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet these criteria, bidding maintenance contractors shall provide, in writing, the labor rate they will charge the Government, per hour for “over-and-above” discrepancies.  Secondly, bidding contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is # OAS-S-06-0004 and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular # 2005-07 effective February 2, 2006.  The NAICS code is 811212 (Office Machine Repair and Maintenance).  The contract will be firm, fixed-price for a base period of one year and four (4) one-year option periods.

STATEMENT OF WORK: The Executive Office of the President (EOP), Office of Administration (OA) intends to award a Time and Materials Contract for the repair and maintenance of faxes and printers.  In FY 05, the EOP expended approximately $70,000.00 in printer maintenance and OEM parts per year.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar value for this requirement.  Actual printer and fax maintenance and repairs are dependent upon the actual needs of EOP components during each period of the contract.  Approximately 95% of the printers are HP, however EOP components also use the following equipment: Samsung, Lexmark 720, and Cannon printers and Panasonic, Cannon and Brother Faxes.

	1. legally resided in the United States (U.S.);
	2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or
	3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S.  The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1.	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
	•	High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
	•	Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
	•	Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

	1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
	2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
	3)	Favorable credit report, if required;3 
	4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
	5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

	A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
	If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

NOTES:

1 FIPS 201 is available at:  www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf

2 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer.  The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge.  The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.

3 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

4 In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM.  Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block  " B "  of the  " Agency Use Only "  section of the investigative form.  This report is available for all case types.

5 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (JAR 2852.223-70) (JUN 1996)

(a)	"Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.

(b)	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.

(c)	Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.

(d)	If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.

(e)	When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

(f)	Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.

<DESC>Synopsis/solicitation RFQ-NCI-60047-NG is hereby amended to answer questions received from interested parties.  The due date is NOT extended.  All other articles remain unchanged. 

1.  Question:  In regards to the measurement of As, Se and Zn by INAA, what are the required or desired detection limits (measurement sensitivity) for each of these elements for this study?

Answer:  Using neutron activation analysis (NAA), arsenic has been quantified at levels above the detection limit in almost all toenail samples measured with this method.  The issue of detection limits was therefore not of concern when we decided that NAA was preferred, for the reasons noted below.

2.  Question:  Solicitation RFQ-NCI-60047-NG requests neuron activation analysis of toenail clippings for arsenic, selenium, and zinc.  This email is written to identify whether inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-Ms) would be an acceptable alternative. 

Answer:  

i.    The Government assumes that the question pertains to neutron activation analysis (NAA), not neuron activation analysis, as in the question.     
ii.   A non-destructive analytical method was chosen, so as to preserve the specimens for future analyses of other factors.
iii.  NAA was selected to permit the measurements to be fully compatible with closely related studies conducted in New England.
iv.  NAA has often been used in analyses of toenails for the purpose of exposure assessment in studies of arsenic-exposed populations.  In these populations, toenail arsenic is correlated with other, independent measures of arsenic exposure.

3.  Question:  One must wonder why NAA was selected here, other than the fact that it is a non-destructive technique.  Few labs have access to a nuclear reactor for anything like the kind of time necessary to measure these elements in this number of specimens, and those that do may lack the validation for these clinical matrices.  NAA may yet prove to be cost prohibitive.  How was NAA selected for this RFQ.  Was any thought given to other analytical approaches?

Answer:  See answer to question 2 above.

4.  Question:  I had wondered why NCI would even bother trying to assess trace element exposure using toenails.  We know that nails are an unreliable matrix (non-homogeneous trace element distribution), subject to unknown exogenous contamination and, washing procedures notwithstanding, subject to leaching of bound metals.

It seems to me that serum and/or plasma specimens would yield more reliable estimates of Zn and Se nutritional status.  As for as exposure, timed urine specimens (or a spot urine corrected for creatinine excretion) would make better sense.  Yes, as is excreted slowly in nails and hair making a cumulative assessment potential feasible.  Unfortunately, the quality of this specimen (toenail) must surely negate any potential gains.  Since national databases exists for serum Se, Zn and As, they might prove better benchmarks with which to compare local data.

Answer:  Our primary interest is in assessing long-term cumulative exposure to arsenic among individuals in a specific study population.  For this purpose, toenails from study subjects are preferable to other biologic samples that would provide estimates of temporally proximate exposures.  Spot urine samples were also collected from all subjects, and overnight urine and blood samples were collected from a random sample of respondents.  Arsenic speciation has been completed for all urine samples, along with creatinine concentrations.

STATEMENT OF WORK: Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with elevated risk of several internal cancers, and in particular, bladder cancer.  The observation that bladder cancer risk is elevated subsequent to arsenic ingestion comes from studies in several populations worldwide, including Southwest Taiwan, Northeast Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Cordoba Province of Argentina.  These populations historically have been exposed to very high levels of arsenic in their drinking water, and dramatic risk elevations are observed, with relative risks ranging from 3 or 4 to 15, compared to populations with low levels of arsenic in their drinking water.  Exposures in these regions of the world ranged between 200 ug/L to 1500 ug/L.  
	
The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  Reasons for this elevation are poorly understood.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The main objective is to determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall:	

1	Analyze samples for the presence and concentration of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and Zinc (Zn) using nuclear activation analysis (NAA).  

2	Prepare all samples as necessary (routine analysis) prior to NAA analysis.  

3	Contractor shall specify whether cleaning of samples prior to analysis is included in the proposal.  If cleaning is included in the proposal, the cost shall be identified as a separately priced line item. 

4	In the case-control study, toenail samples were collected from 2,545 participants.  The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample analyses will be required.  In addition, 10% (255 samples) randomly selected samples of adequate size will be split and blindly submitted for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  Thus the maximum number of analyses, including QA samples will be 2,800.  All analyses must be completed, with results submitted, no later than eight (8) months after the start date of this contract.  Higher throughput, which would permit completion of analyses no later than six (6) months after contract initiation, will be to the advantage of the contracting laboratory.

The contractor shall provide a detailed description of quality control/quality assurance procedures that are used for preparation and analysis of blanks and standardized samples.  

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 

1	The Contractor shall electronically communicate results of all analyses, including quality control information, to the NCI Project Officer on a weekly basis, using an Excel format to be provided by NCI. Problems or delays relating to any aspect of these analyses shall be reported to the NCI Project Officer as soon as noted by the contractor. 

2	Contractor shall provide a summary report of progress, study management, problems, and their resolution, to NCI on a monthly basis, to commence the beginning of the first month after samples have been received by the contractor.  

3	The report shall include, but not be limited to: Counts of the numbers of samples received, analyzed, and whose results were reported in the monthly reporting period, as well as totals to date.  
		
4	The Contractor shall provide a final report to NCI at the conclusion of all analyses which shall include summaries of these same data.  

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: NCI will provide to the contractor toenail samples collected from study subjects in the period 2002-2005.  If cleaning of samples is not included in an offeror’s proposal, this will be done by the Government prior to shipment.   In addition to original samples, an additional 10% of the samples will be blinded replicates, indistinguishable from the original samples.  These blinded replicates will be submitted to the contractor for quality control purposes.

Samples will be shipped to the contractor from NCI's sample repository in batches to be determined by consultation and agreement between NCI and the contractor, and at a frequency to be determined in like manner.   Prior to shipment of samples from the NCI repository to the contractor, the batch size used in analysis will be communicated to NCI to permit the rational organization of QA samples.   The weight of each sample shipped from NCI shall be no less than 10 mg. 

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  Within two weeks of submission of data to NCI, the Project Officer will review the data submitted to NCI by the contractor, and inform the contractor of any anomalies found and/or corrective action required

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 1, 2006 – January 31, 2007.  NOTE:  Offerors may propose a shorter delivery schedule and will be given additional technical points if this shorter delivery schedule is proposed.
