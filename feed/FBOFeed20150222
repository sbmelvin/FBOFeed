<a href="mailto:leola.liggins.civ@mail.mil">ACC- Warren (ACC-WRN)(RRAD)</a>
<DESC>RRAD has a requirement to provide software support for the Automatic Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) application at RRAD on an on-call basis, not to exceed one base year and two option years. <br>  <br> An Approved Justification For Other Than Full And Open Competition (J&A) is present in the contract file. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> a. As authorized by FAR 6.302-(1), procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because award to any source other than Paragon Software Engineering, Inc is not possible. Paragon Software Engineering Inc., the developer of the Directorate for Maintenance ASRS application software at Red River Army Depot, has maintained it since its initial inception in the mid 1980's. The software is proprietary to Paragon and source code is not available on the open market. In addition to being the original contractor and software developer, Paragon has provided under contract all ASRS application software, software alterations, modifications, upgrades, and maintenance support since February 2001. The services include in-depth knowledge of the system, the requirement for effective and reliable software maintenance support, and the ability to provide the level of support necessary to react to scheduled software maintenance or emergencies via modem or by on-site visits. The contractor will be required to be on call to provide telephone support twenty four (24) hours/day five days (Monday - Friday) each week, as needed. <br>  <br> While it is impractical to compete the current acquisition due to the proprietary nature of the software code, actions to increase competition were focused on removing this constraint to foster competition on future contracts. A project to replace the Warehouse Management System has been established in RRAD's Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for FY 17 funding. This project includes replacement of the proprietary software that will promote competition for future software maintenance contracts. In addition, the Army is currently reviewing the possibility of having an Army wide Enterprise ASRS system.   <br>  <br> RRAD has a requirement to provide software support for the Automatic Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) application at RRAD on an on-call basis, not to exceed one base year and two option years. Work shall be performed either on-site or at remote locations via Virtual Private Network (VPN). Service will be provided in strict accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). <br>  <br> 1. General. The Directorate of Maintenance at RRAD has an Automatic Storage & Retrieval (ASRS) System located in building 321. The ASRS application software receives transactions from the Maintenance Shop Floor System (MSFS) via TCP/IP protocol over the Army's network, and processes them. Transactions generated by ASRS are then passed to update MSFS, which is the stock balance record keeper. The ASRS application software is run on an HP Non-stop S7800 server running HP's G06 operating system release, G06.27.00. Remote access to it is now over the Internet through the Depot's firewall rather than by dialup modem. <br> 2. Scope. This requirement is to provide a firm-fixed on-call, one base year, with 2 option years, maintenance service contract to maintain/modify/upgrade ASRS application software at RRAD. Any task to be performed under this contract will be documented and approved by the Chief, ASRS and Receiving Branch of the Production Support Division within the Maintenance Directorate, then submitted to the DFIM COR and the MSFS analyst/programmer for approval to proceed prior to any work accomplishment. Any task completed under this contract will be confirmed by reviewing completed task documentation submitted by the firm. A designated person within the ASRS and Receiving Branch will certify that vendor tasks have been accomplished before any contract payment is made. No charges will be made against the contract unless vendor services are utilized. All ASRS application software modifications/upgrades, source code and systems documentation generated by the contractor shall become the property of the U. S. Government.   <br> 3. Tasks. Subject to Government documented approval the Contractor shall be called upon to perform any of the following type tasks: <br> 	a. Contractor shall provide a cost estimate for all tasks Contractor states he/she can accomplish. Contractor shall assist in the planning and design of proposed changes, including a formal design document, if required. <br> 	b. Contractor shall develop/modify/upgrade ASRS software to achieve specified design objectives. <br> 	c. Contractor shall install and test software changes using methods that will minimize impact on scheduled computer production. Testing of modifications/ upgrades which could risk loss of data integrity shall be accomplished using non-productions test files before installing any changes to the production software. <br> 	d. Contractor shall employ configuration control procedures to insure that the system can be restored to its original state when it is necessary to remove a software change. <br> 	e. Contractor shall deliver change pages to all affected ASRS system documentation. <br> 	f. Contractor shall provide training of Government software/computer operations personnel as required/approved by Red River Army Depot (RRAD). <br> 	g. Contractor shall interface new periphereal equipment with the HP nonstop server as required/approved. <br> 	h. Contractor shall install changes to the HP nonstop server OS software, as approved by RRAD and HP. <br> 4. Work Location.

Work site location shall be at the Contractors discretion. Contractors shall obtain approval production is not interrupted. While on site at RRAD, suitable space in or near the computer room of building 321 will be provided Contractor to perform necessary work. <br> 5. Subcontractors.
