RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a!  ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
GENERAL PURPOSE STORED VALUE CARDS

BACKGROUND

The United States Postal Service (USPS) desires to engage in a process with viable companies to discuss establishing a General Purpose Prepaid Stored Value Card Program.  This process requires the submission of information from interested companies followed by USPS evaluation.  Potential companies that satisfy this evaluation process may be asked to engage in discussions with representatives from the USPS, and may be requested to make a formal presentation in-person and final evaluations will then occur.  

PURPOSE

The USPS desires to sell General Purpose Stored Value Card at approximately 15,000 POS ONE locations nationwide. The sales of General Purpose Stored Value Cards at USPS retail sites will be operated as an alliance between the USPS and a commercial partner.  The selected partner will be responsible for product design, development, production, distribution, customer service, advertising, marketing, merchandising support, application processing, card fulfillment, transaction processing, funds settlement, and store-level reporting.  The partner will also assume liability for all cards sold by the USPS.  The USPS will be responsible for card sales, POS ONE activation of cold cards through POS ONE equipment, and reloading of such cards.

DESCRIPTION

The USPS General Purpose Stored Value Card program will be comprised of two types of cards:

1.)Instant Issue Card- The instant issue General Purpose Stored Value Card will be sold for any dollar amount up the limit established by the USPS and its partner not to exceed $500.  The funds loaded on the cards will be immediately available to the purchaser.  The instant issue card will not be reloadable.

2.)Registered Card - After the initial purchase of an instant issue General Purpose Stored Value Card, customers will have the option of obtaining a personalized, e.g. registered, card by calling the partner's toll-free number and providing their name, date of birth, social security number, street address and telephone number and government issued ID number (driver's license, passport etc.).  When this option is selected, an embossed card will be sent to the customer by First-Class mail at the expense of the partner.  Upon phone activation of the embossed card, the original card will be de-activated and the partner will transfer the remaining funds on the de-activated card to the new card.  The registered card will be reloadable up to the maximum value established by the USPS and its partner not to exceed $5,000 at any time and the aggregate reloads will not exceed $20,000 during a calendar year.  Customers who obtain registered cards will receive monthly account statements by First Class Mail at the expense of the partner.
