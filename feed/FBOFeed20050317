<SUBJECT>D -- Development of a Common Biospecimen Coordination System and Informatics Infrastructure for NCI Prostate Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs)
<SOLNBR>N02-CO-51018-17
<RESPDATE>050405
<CONTACT>Robin Irving, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-8611, Fax (301) 480-0241, Email ri23j@nih.gov - Todd Cole, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-3820, Fax (301) 480-0241, Email tc51u@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a contractor to develop a design plan and budget for system implementation of a common biospecimen coordination system and informatics infrastructure (Biospecimen Coordination System) for multiple NCI Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) in prostate cancer research. This system shall facilitate biospecimen and data sharing among scientific investigators located at different institutions by employing standardized approaches for collecting, processing, storing, annotating and distributing high-quality biospecimens. Initially, this system shall support the Inter-SPORE Prostate Biomarkers Study (IPBS), a validation study of prospective prostate cancer biomarkers. Ultimately, the purpose of this project is to serve as a pilot for the evolving National Biospecimen Network (NBN) by developing an infrastructure to annotate and integrate specimen banks, such as those of the SPOREs, to enhance the quality and availability of various biospecimens and associated data for the broader scientific community.

The Biospecimen Coordination System informatics infrastructure shall promote communication and the exchange of biospecimens and data between participating centers and shall be fully compatible with the NCI’s Cancer Bioinformatics Grid (caBIG) (http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/). Therefore, in addition to serving as a pilot for the NBN, the IPBS infrastructure shall provide the Prostate SPOREs with an integrated, scalable informatics system that may serve as a model for other biorepository networks. The Biospecimen Coordination System described here is not intended to supplant existing resources at the participating SPORE sites, and shall integrate with relevant clinical departments (e.g., surgery and pathology) without interrupting existing workflows. 

The major components of the Biospecimen Coordination System include: (1) Human subjects protection, privacy protection and informed consent processes; (2) Rigorous standard operating procedures (SOP’s) for biospecimen collection, processing, annotation, storage and dissemination; (3) Quality assurance/quality control; (4) Integration with associated clinical data, both retrospectively and prospectively; (5) Informatics system requirements; (6) Biospecimen and data access policies; (7) Biohazard considerations and packing, shipping and storage policies; (8) Intellectual property/Ongoing system oversight and maintenance; (9) Establishment of a common repository for biospecimens unused by the IPBS; and (10) Personnel management. 

Because the Biospecimen Coordination System is envisioned as an ongoing resource with broad applicability to the scientific community, the Contractor shall establish a common biospecimen repository of material not required for the IPBS. Access to this common biorepository will be overseen by an expert committee assembled by the NCI. Prostate SPORE programs may store some biospecimens locally; however, each participating SPORE program will ship a subset of samples (rigorously collected and annotated based on SOPs) to the common repository managed by the Contractor.

This Contract consists of two phases. Phase 1 (4 months) focuses on developing a recommended design plan and budget for system implementation. The Phase 1 design plan shall also describe at least two other viable options and alternatives (including budgets) for implementing the pilot system. Phase 2 (20 months) is the implementation of the plan as a pilot system for the Prostate SPOREs and will be contingent upon review and approval of the Phase 1 design plan and budget by an NCI-convened expert committee. The Contractor shall submit the Phase 1 design plan and alternatives with budgets within three (3) months of the Contract award. 

The expert review committee may accept the Phase 1 recommended design plan, reject the Phase 1 design plan, or suggest changes based on the options and alternatives stated in the design plan. Therefore, Phase 2 is an option to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. An important charge of the expert review committee will be to determine the appropriate human subject provisions for Phase 2 based on the Phase 1 design plan. The contractor shall incorporate all required human subjects requirements before Phase 2 implementation based on the recommendations of the expert review committee. Upon approval of the Phase 1 design plan, the Contractor shall complete system implementation (Phase 2) within twenty (20) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include the following Mandatory Qualification Criteria which must be met in order for an offeror’s proposal to be considered for award: detailed information on the Offeror’s contract(s)/project(s) similar in nature to the solicitation work scope to document at least two (2) consecutive years of experience of the Project Director and the Offeror company/institution in managing, running, and overseeing a multi-institutional human biorepository network within the past five years. Contract(s)/project(s) listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state or local governments, and commercial concerns. The following information shall be submitted to document this experience: Name of contracting organization; Contract number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number); Contract type; Total contract value; Description of the requirement; Contracting Officer’s name and telephone number; Project Director’s name and telephone number; and Standard Industrial Code or NAICS code. 

The Government will employ a deviated data rights clause for this project. The RFP will provide draft language of what the final deviation may include.

This solicitation is anticipated to result in one (1) award to an offeror (including its qualified consultants and subcontractors) capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the Statement of Work. The contract type is a cost-reimbursement (completion) for a period of 4 months with one (1) option for twenty (20) months. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512 with a size standard of $21,000,000. NOTE: THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS REQUIREMENT IS FULL AND OPEN TO ALL SOURCES, BOTH SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CO-51018-17 will be available on or about March 31, 2005 with receipt of proposals due 35 days after issuance (on/about May 4, 2005). The RFP will contain information relative to a pre-proposal conference that will be held prior to April 15, 2005. Given the anticipated short-turn around between the issuance of the RFP and the pre-proposal conference, potential offerors are encouraged to review the draft statement of work (SOW) that was used for the Sources Sought/Request for Information SS-NCI-ESS-2005 and begin to formulate questions concerning the SOW. For the most part, the draft SOW for SS-NCI-ESS-2005 is substantially the same as the SOW to be used for this RFP.  The RFP will contain specific instructions concerning the submission of your questions and the date/location/time for the pre-proposal conference.  PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR PROPOSAL MUST BE COMPLIANT WITH THE STATEMENT OF WORK CONTAINED IN THE RFP. The draft SOW is located on NCI’s website as specified below. The RFP will only be available electronically and may be accessed through the National Cancer Institute’s Research Contracts Branch (RCB) Home Page at http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/ Once at the RCB Home Page, select Current Request for Proposals. All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in the electronic RFP package. POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE RFP AND ANY AMENDMENTS. NCI plans to make an award on or before September 30, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure. 

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently U.S. licensed influenza vaccines for human usage are produced in embryonated hen’s eggs. Reliance on a single product as a substrate for influenza vaccine production has several vulnerabilities including a protracted vaccine production cycle, lethal toxicity to avian influenza viruses, and susceptibility to production drops caused by disease or nutrition. Therefore, diversification of vaccine manufacturing substrates, such as tissue culture cells and recombinant DNA expression systems may provide a more responsive and flexible influenza vaccine industry with increased overall production capacity and ability to provide ample vaccine supply rapidly in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop domestically manufactured cell- or recombinant DNA-based influenza vaccine leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities that the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing, clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using tissue culture cell or recombinant DNA expression system substrates. Funds may be used also for scale-up development and manufacturing facility design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or partnerships with companies having vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to provide U.S. pandemic influenza preparedness. Other eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of successful development and licensure of vaccines for human usage; (2) Vaccine program that includes influenza vaccine candidates for seasonal or pandemic influenza that have successfully completed safety and immunogenicity human clinical trials (Phase I); (3) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (4) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of October 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government.

On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 ìg of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage.  The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

	The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities.  The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a market survey to locate sources of Software Defined Radios (SDR) for use by the U.S. Government to evaluate the feasibility of waveform porting and interoperability with current U.S. military radios.  The radio must be sufficiently software  programmable to host waveform code presently being developed to emulate existing military radios.  It is also highly desirable that the radio already contains one or more U.S. tactical waveforms and be capable of communicating with currently fielded radio s.  Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliance is preferred, but not a mandatory requirement at this time.  The minimum required overall Radio Frequency (RF) range over which the radio must operate is 1.5 to 51 2 MHz, which could be performed by either one or two RF front-ends or radio models.  The radio shall be able to host such waveforms as SINCGARS ESIP/INC, HF (AM, FM, SSB) with ALE (Automatic Link Establishment), Have Quick I/II, and other VHF/UHF AM/FM wav eforms.  Preferably the radio should be a non-developmental (NDI) production item, using mature proven technology.  Any interested sources please send information for evaluation NLT 15 days after this publication to US Army CERDEC.  This information should  include technical specification sheets, price list, availability, and previous sales history. Attn: AMSRD-CER-ST-WL-TR (Valerie Hufford) Bldg. 2700, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703.

This is for the continuation of a current contract  for ongoing  research projects for an estimated 213 hours to end on July 31, 2005.  To select another contractor at this time would result in months of d elay and disruption of several projects already in process for which continuity must be maintained.  It also would result in an increase of cost to the Government.  This procurement shall be under other and full and open competition procedures in accordanc e with FAR 6.301-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quote.  At the end of this contract, a new contract will be solicited under full and open competition.

The contract type will be Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite Quantity.  The contract will be for a twelve (12) month base period with one (1) one-year option period.  The current contracts end 09/30/2005.  The FAA is surveying the market to determine if qualified vendors are interested in this contract opportunity. The DUAT Service provides on-line current weather information, forecast weather information, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) information, and flight planning services to authorized users.  The DUAT Service is currently provided under two separate contracts, one each with Data Transformation Corp. (a small business) and CSC Information Systems LLC. On 1 February 2005 the Federal Aviation Administration announced the award of the FAA's A-76 Public/Private Competition of the Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSSs), excluding the three (3) AFSSs in Alaska, to Lockheed Martin (LM) as the Service Provider (SP).   It is anticipated that DUAT service will be integrated into LM FS21 system; however when and how DUAT service will be integrated is uncertain at this time.  In order to ensure that the DUAT service requirement continues until LM's transition includes the DUAT functionality, the existing DUAT service needs to be extended. Interested vendors should respond with a technical statement of experience and proven capability which will be reviewed according to the following criteria: Â·	Ability to provide Final Operational Capabilities (FOC) by COB 30 September 2005 with no gap in service Â·	Approved Qualified Internet Communications Provider (QICP) Â·	X.25 protocol experience Â·	NADIN II certification Â·	Experience providing aviation weather and displaying weather graphics Â·	Experience providing flight planning services Â·	Experience providing a 24 hour, seven day a week Help Desk Â·	Established customer base or demonstrated ability to acquire one Â·	Experience interfacing with the National Airspace System (NAS) Â·	Experience operating telephone and Internet based systems  Â·	Experience providing information security Â·	Experience developing and maintaining large databases Â·	Upon initiation and at regular intervals, new vendors must undergo security certification and accreditation through development and submission of an FAA Security Certification and Authorization Package (SCAP) in accordance with the FAA Information Systems Security Handbook. Each criterion will be reviewed to determine vendor suitability.  All criteria above must be met.  This Market Survey-RFI will be used to determine the extent of industry interest in providing DUATS services.  The FAA is aware that the incumbent vendors are qualified and interested. To assist you in responding to this Market Survey, attached are the current DUAT Statement of Work (SOW), the current QCIP Requirement Specification and the QCIP Advisory Circular. In addition,in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:: 1.	Capability Statement - This document should identify past performance references. 2.	Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 3.	If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 	8(a) or small business respondent. 4.

<DESC>The Naval Air Terminal utilizes a 2,500 square feet cold storage facility to store 463L pallets loaded with perishable cargo in Building LP-205.  A forklift is used to load the pallets onto the system.  The pallets are then manually positioned in the cooler via a non-powered roller deck.  The roller deck consists of a ball transfer system along with standard gravity roller conveyors.  The ball transfer system runs down the center of the cooler and allows the pallets to be moved in any direction.  The gravity roller conveyors extend from the sides of the ball transfers and are primarily used for final storage locations.  The requirement is to provide and install a new ball transfer system for the Naval Air Terminal Cold Storage Facility in Building LP-205.  The installation of the new ball transfer system should include the removal of activity’s current ball transfer system.  The new ball transfer system shall be capable of conveying loads weighing 10,500 pounds distributed over a 108-inch by 88-inch area without damage or permanent deformation to the conveyor system or pallet.  The closing date is extended to Thursday, 3/31/05 at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).

<DESC>Reference is made to the March 4, 2005 posting, Reference Number 0430044B, and Modification 1 and Modification 2, both posted on March 17, 2005, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the “Proposal”) from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the design and implementation of the LNG Receiving Terminal in Thailand.

This is to notify interested U.S. firms that the deadline for the submission of proposals is March 28, 2005.  This notice supersedes Modification 1 and 2.

Mr. Chitrapongse Kwangsukstith, Senior Executive Vice President, Gas Business Group; PTT Public Company Limited; 555 Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; Phone: 66-2-537-3915, Fax: 66-2-537-3917."PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE" POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. "PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE" 
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the design and implementation of the LNG Receiving Terminal in Thailand.

The Feasibility Study on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Receiving Terminal will assist PTT in developing this priority infrastructure project, which will allow Thailand to secure its gas supply and avoid energy shortages in the next decade.  Being a dominant player in oil and gas businesses, PTT must plan for new sources of natural gas supply by 2010 to avoid energy shortages and fulfill the demand in the power generation and petrochemical sectors.  PTT anticipates that LNG would be available at a price competitive to domestic natural gas when all pipelines reach full capacity in 2009.  Initial investment size envisaged by PTT for the facility is 3 to 5 million of tons annually (MTA), valued at $500-700 million.  Currently, Thailand fuels 70 percent of its electricity generation with natural gas.  The Feasibility Study will have strong development impact in enhancing Thailand’s infrastructure for power generation.  

The primary objectives of this study would be to determine the LNG receiving terminal's most appropriate location, identify the appropriate technology for the terminal and re-gasification facilities, and define the required level of investment for the project.  PTT seeks to complete a feasibility study in September 2005, finalize the design and construction bidding process in December 2007, and complete the LNG terminal construction in September 2010.  PTT completed an internal study on LNG sourcing strategy and markets, but requires technical assistance to analyze the configuration, state-of-the-art technologies, and investments required for the LNG Import Terminal and consideration of associated facilities.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $667,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background Definitional Mission Report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, March 22, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Initial investment size envisaged by PTT for the facility is 3 to 5 million of tons annually (MTA), valued at $500-700 million.  Currently, Thailand fuels 70 percent of its electricity generation with natural gas.  The Feasibility Study will have strong development impact in enhancing Thailand’s infrastructure for power generation.  

The primary objectives of this study would be to determine the LNG receiving terminal's most appropriate location, identify the appropriate technology for the terminal and re-gasification facilities, and define the required level of investment for the project.  PTT seeks to complete a feasibility study in September 2005, finalize the design and construction bidding process in December 2007, and complete the LNG terminal construction in September 2010.  PTT completed an internal study on LNG sourcing strategy and markets, but requires technical assistance to analyze the configuration, state-of-the-art technologies, and investments required for the LNG Import Terminal and consideration of associated facilities.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $667,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background Definitional Mission Report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information; it is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources of flight control computers to replace the existing computers in the E-2C and C-2A Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCS).  The replacement Digital Flight Control Computer (DFCC) is intended to reduce aircraft operating costs, increase reliability and maintainability, improve airplane flying qualities, and provide growth capability for future performance enhancements.   A U.S. Navy integration team will lead the effort to install the replacement DFCC into the E-2 and C-2 aircraft. Upgrades to current flight control computers as well as Non-Developmental replacement computers will be considered.

Pending future funding allocations, specific DFCC functional requirements will be defined.  For purposes of this initial market request for information, prospective vendors should consider the following general performance requirements:  The replacement DFCC shall operate in a carrier-based aircraft environment with an MTBF exceeding 5000 hours.  The DFCC shall be a form and fit replacement of the existing computer, interfacing with the existing flight control sensors and actuators.  The DFCC shall provide airplane flying qualities improvements and growth capability for future performance enhancements, to include integrated navigation system functions. The DFCC shall provide a Continuous Built-In Test (CBIT) to detect and isolate in-flight faults within the DFCC and, in other AFCS WRAs where practical.  In order to minimize single-point failures within the AFCS, a DFCC with redundant computing channels and fault isolation paths is preferred.  Consideration shall be given to using other existing sources of sensor data to further enhance CBIT effectiveness.  The DFCC shall also provide an IBIT to demonstrate the operational readiness of the DFCC and other AFCS WRAs, where practical.  IBIT shall provide the maintainer with adequate information to identify the faulty WRA, or where ambiguous, the faulty WRA or wire group.

This program is currently unfunded. Future program funding status is to be determined, and may include one, or both aircraft types.   However, the replacement DFCC shall be common to both the E-2 and C-2 aircraft.  In addition, the replacement DFCC shall ensure a positive return on investment when compared to total ownership cost of the current systems.  The U.S. Navy E-2 inventory is currently 69 aircraft and is expected to remain in service through 2035.  The U.S. Navy C-2 inventory currently consists of 35 aircraft and is expected to remain in service through 2017.

The E-2/C-2 Program Office will consider alternative funding sources for this program. Some of those sources, but not necessarily all, will include applications to the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) LECP program, similar programs sponsored by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the OSD Reduction in Total Ownership Costs program, the NAVAIR Cost Wise Readiness Initiative program (CWRI), and the Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program. Information contained in responses to this RFI may be used to support any, all or other program initiatives. 

Responses to this RFI should include: 1.) A summary outline of the performance specifications of the replacement DFCC; 2.) A short description of the hardware and software changes which may be required to meet E-2 and C-2 unique aircraft interfaces;  3.) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate of vendor non-recurring costs; 4.) A ROM estimate of DFCC unit costs; and,  5.) Any other information at vendor discretion, but limited to 5 printed pages.  To the maximum extent possible, estimated E-2 and C-2 costs should be separated.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Large Business, HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 
Project Title: Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Data Coordination and Consolidation Center (DCCC)
Project Description:  The goal of this project is to develop and implement a set of web-based tools to:
1) provide a data collection, storage, analysis and reporting center for CSAP program activities, to include collection and reporting of SAMHSA’s National Outcome Measures (NOMs);
2) provide training and technical assistance to the prevention and other professional users on SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF), to promote consistency in understanding and implementation of the SPF;
3) fund epidemiological workgroups in all States not funded through the Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant Program (SPF SIG).
For this contract, the Offeror will create these tools within existing CSAP web-based resources to maximize the efficiency of product delivery. 
The technological aspects of this contract require that the web-based tools are user-friendly and that they accurately communicate the requirements of CSAP and SAMHSA around the SPF and the NOMs.  The user-friendliness is critical to ensure that the implementation of the SPF produces quality planning and service processes in the prevention field, and that the field can access training and TA to aid in this implementation.  Accuracy is critical to ensure that, as states and communities engage in these planning and service processes, they can produce and deliver high quality data for federal reporting requirements.
This contract will assume the responsibility for reporting state and community data to CSAP and SAMHSA in timely and easy-to-read formats to help federal staff in assessing substance use trends and effectiveness of CSAP funding.  The contract will require participation in national, regional and state  workshops and conferences, and the organization  of these events as needed, to ensure understanding and use of the web-based tools by relevant audiences.  The Offeror must comply with, and assist the government in completion of, all required federal processes, such as OMB clearances, preparation of ad hoc and standard reports and presentation materials, and management of the project.
Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due March 31, 2005. The anticipated period of performance is a base year and 4 (12month) option periods.   After review of the responses received a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities around April 15, 2005.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-05-0001 Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) Advisory Circular (AC) Compliance Validation and Demonstration - Structural Usage Monitoring and Flight Regime Recognition 1. Background Currently, no rotorcraft HUMS, along with the ground-based station, has been certified by the FAA to provide usage or condition-based monitoring (e.g., health monitoring) for maintenance credits.  Certification of a HUMS for maintenance credit purposes is considered to be a complex endeavor.  "Maintenance Credit" means to give approval to a HUMS application that adds to, replaces, or intervenes in industry accepted maintenance practices or flight operations.   AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, is the only FAA Advisory Circular (AC) providing guidance for HUMS airworthiness approval.  Section MG-15 provides guidance for Transport category rotorcraft to achieve airworthiness approval for installation, credit validation, and instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) for a full range of HUMS applications.  The AC establishes an acceptable means, but not the only means of certifying a rotorcraft HUMS regardless of complexity or intended usage to modify maintenance and/or operational actions.   Installation approval covers the certification requirements (e.g. hardware and software qualification requirements) for systems and equipment that acquires, stores, processes, and displays HUMS data.  The approval also includes the airframe installation or any one of these functions for a particular application.  AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, addresses the most complex and extensive HUMS.  Less complex systems may be covered by use of only the applicable parts of the AC.  In addition, there may be different functional distributions between airborne and ground-based equipment.  The requirements of HUMS equipment consists of common criteria; which apply to airborne, ground-based, and installation equipment; plus the unique criteria for airborne and ground based systems. The AC requires that any HUMS applications for which maintenance credits are sought must be validated.  Evidence shall be provided to show that the physics involved for each application is understood.  This will allow the monitoring technique/algorithm/parameter, rejection criteria, and associated intervention actions to be well chosen.  If an approved system is going to be changed, re-evaluation is required to ensure the existing credit(s) are not invalidated.  Re-evaluation efforts will vary and depend on the application type, the credit sought, and the degree of failure or malfunction associated with the component/equipment.    HUMS applicants are also required to provide the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Requirements (FAR) and Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), Part 29.  An applicant may be the airframe manufacturer, the HUMS OEM, or the aircraft operator.  ICA should address the integration of HUMS with the aircraft.  The applicant must address the ICA items listed in the AC for airborne and ground-based systems and equipment in addition to FAR/JAR Part 29. Section MG-15 of AC 29-2C was developed by the Rotorcraft Health Usage Monitoring System Advisory Group and first released in 1999.  This advisory group consisted of representatives from the FAA Aircraft Certification Services, FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group, U.S. Industry, European Industry, and Joint Airworthiness Authority.  This AC was written in a generic manner such that it provides the basic requirements and guidance for certification of HUMS.  Since no HUMS have yet to be certified in accordance with this AC on a "maintenance credit" basis, the FAA intends to conduct research to assist in the validation of the certification guidance.  Additionally, HUMS research efforts are to develop, validate, and/or demonstrate HUMS operational requirements, applicable technologies including processes; methodologies; and algorithms, and other required information including data to guide the certification of HUMS.  The results of this R&D will also allow the FAA to expand the existing guidance by incorporating any lessons learned at the conclusion of the research.  2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to develop and conduct a flight test program to support the validation and demonstration of HUMS operation requirements, technologies, and processes and to collect and substantiate structural usage data.  Advanced usage monitoring and flight regime recognition technologies for structures will be used in this program.  Particularly, this effort shall support AC-29-2C, Section MG-15, which can be downloaded using the following link:  http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-05-0002 Structural Usage Monitoring and Flight Regime Recognition  Algorithm and Methodology Enhancement and Validation 1. Background Currently, no rotorcraft HUMS, along with the ground-based station, has been certified by the FAA to provide usage or condition-based monitoring (e.g., health monitoring) for maintenance credits.  Certification of a HUMS for maintenance credit purposes is considered to be a complex endeavor.  "Maintenance Credit" means to give approval to a HUMS application that adds to, replaces, or intervenes in industry accepted maintenance practices or flight operations.   AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, is the only FAA Advisory Circular (AC) providing guidance for HUMS airworthiness approval.  Section MG-15 provides guidance for Transport category rotorcraft to achieve airworthiness approval for installation, credit validation, and instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) for a full range of HUMS applications.  The AC establishes an acceptable means, but not the only means of certifying a rotorcraft HUMS regardless of complexity or intended usage to modify maintenance and/or operational actions.   Installation approval covers the certification requirements (e.g. hardware and software qualification requirements) for systems and equipment that acquires, stores, processes, and displays HUMS data.  The approval also includes the airframe installation or any one of these functions for a particular application.  AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, addresses the most complex and extensive HUMS.  Less complex systems may be covered by use of only the applicable parts of the AC.  In addition, there may be different functional distributions between airborne and ground-based equipment.  The requirements of HUMS equipment consists of common criteria; which apply to airborne, ground-based, and installation equipment; plus the unique criteria for airborne and ground based systems. The AC requires that any HUMS applications for which maintenance credits are sought must be validated.  Evidence shall be provided to show that the physics involved for each application is understood.  This will allow the monitoring technique/algorithm/parameter, rejection criteria, and associated intervention actions to be well chosen.  If an approved system is going to be changed, re-evaluation is required to ensure the existing credit(s) are not invalidated.  Re-evaluation efforts will vary and depend on the application type, the credit sought, and the degree of failure or malfunction associated with the component/equipment.    HUMS applicants are also required to provide the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Requirements (FAR) and Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), Part 29.  An applicant may be the airframe manufacturer, the HUMS OEM, or the aircraft operator.  ICA should address the integration of HUMS with the aircraft.

Offerors shall provide a detailed cost proposal.  In-house funding including cost matching and/or services-in-kind will be identified in the cost proposal as necessary.  All resources including manpower shall also be identified and categorized.    l.	Offerors shall propose a detailed work plan including milestones and schedules. 7. Method of Evaluation  Proposals will be evaluated in the seven technical areas listed in order of decreasing importance: a.	Technical merit. b.	Utility to AC-29-2C, Section MG-15. c.	Investigative team competency and HUMS experience. d.	Logical and effective development, validation, demonstration, and certification implementation strategies. e.	Technical and implementation risks and the mitigation plan for each. f.	Effective plan for project completion. g.	Availability and quality of equipment and facilities. Cost and cost realism will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable only.  Acceptable proposals will have costs commensurate with the work load proposed and will not be in excess of $207,000 in any fiscal year.   8. Period of Performance:  Efforts lasting between one and five years will be considered.  Multiyear efforts will be funded in yearly increments, providing measurable and adequate performance is shown prior to each new funding increment.

<CONTACT>Jill Larsen, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-777-4723, Fax 801-586-1287, Email Jill.Larsen@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/Request For Information for the replacement of Pacific Crest RF Modems for the TMQ-53 Tactical Meteorological Observing System (TMOS).  
1. 	Purpose.  The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential providers of a replacement RF Modem.  Also, the Request for Information included within this synopsis allows interested industry and other parties the opportunity to provide comments for the development of the RF Modem capability.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time; this announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis. Copies of the submitted information will be reproduced and submitted to the TMOS sustainment office for review and will be used to develop the acquisition strategy and possibly an eventual Request For Proposal (RFP).

2.	Background.  

a.	The TMQ-53 is a tactical weather station that provides meteorological observations in remote, worldwide areas of operation through a quick setup/teardown, easily transportable system.  The sensor set is generally located in a remote area where representative weather is required, while the computer and software for processing the observed data is located within the airfield operations area.
b.	In many areas where deployed, the distance between the sensor set and the computer is too distant for standard serial cable communications.  In these situations, the current method of communication is via Pacific Crest serial RF Modem pairs (RFM96W).  One connected to the data collection module at the sensor set via RS-232 interface and the other connected to a Windows PC computer also via RS-232 interface.  
c.	The Pacific Crest RFM96W modems have become obsolete and are no longer available or repairable and need to be replaced with a suitable substitute.  
d.	The Hill Air Force Base UT, 84 Combat Sustainment Wing, Weather Systems Flight is investigating possible sources for a like or similar RF Modem capability to support future operations of the TMQ-53.

3. 	Program Overview.  

a.	The purpose of this sources sought is to determine:
(1)	Possible modem manufacturers and suppliers to provide a form, fit and function replacement of the Pacific Crest RFM96W modems.
i.	The RFM96W modems are currently fielded in five frequency ranges (the Government is currently attempting to discern what appropriate frequency ranges will be required in the future.  The final list may not include all the frequencies listed below).
1.	132 – 150 MHz VHF (Most Popular)
2.	150 – 174 MHz VHF	
3.	410 – 430 MHz UHF
4.	430 – 450 MHz UHF
5.	450 – 470 MHz UHF
ii.	Transmitter Power: 2 Watts 
iii.	Baud Rate: 4800 
iv.	Spacing Resolution: 12.5 kHz 
v.	Frequency Stability: 2.5 ppm 
vi.	Antenna: Omni Directional or Directional 
vii.	Range: 5nm (Line of Site)
viii.	Other Information: Fast asynchronous transmission protocol, and a Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) base-band modulation
ix.	Replacement modems should maximize, to the degree possible, other existing connections and fixtures used with the Pacific Crest RFM96W modems (current RFM96W physical description is attached.)
1.	Same connectors for antenna, power and data
2.	Same or similar mounting hardware

(2)	Determine if there is a better way to provide the RF Modem capability through a similar, but more efficient and accessible RF technology.
i.	Responses should focus on optional RF technologies that provide greater benefit to the Government due to factors such as:
1.	Increased speed
2.	Lower cost
3.	Increased security of communications
4.	Reduce or eliminate requirement for frequency approvals

NOTE:  The TMQ-53 is comprised of largely Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology.  The Government does NOT have Level III drawings or other extensive data to support specialized development activities.   The Government anticipates that the RF Modem replacement will similarly use COTS technology and does not anticipate developmental costs associated with this replacement.

4.  Information for interested parties.  

a.	Draft RFP.  There is currently no scheduled timeline for proceeding with this effort and thus no anticipated Draft RFP availability date.

b.  	Bidder’s Library.  If this procurement is pursued, it is anticipated that an electronic Bidder’s Library will be established for this acquisition.  Please check the web site in paragraph 5 below for information and updates regarding the Bidder’s Library.  

c.  	Industry Day.  No industry day is expected for this procurement.  

5.  Market Survey / RFI Questions.  Please send your response to Jill Larsen at OO-ALC/LHKC 6029 Wardleigh Road  Bldg 1207 Hill AFB UT 84056-5838 or via e-mail at jill.larsen@hill.af.mil.  Responses are requested no later than close of business on 15 April
 2005. No phone or FAX requests will be accepted.

<DESC>EA-6B Approach Power Management (APC) System Replacement Request for Information (RFI).

This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The intent of this RFI is to assist Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research for a replacement APC system for the EA-6B.  Further this RFI is being advertised to fulfill the requirements of the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Foreign Comparative Test policy for program initiatives seeking FCT Office resource support.

The APC system in the EA-6B functions to set requisite engine power settings to maintain a constant aircraft angle of attack during a powered approach to landing.  The APC system consists primarily of a throttle control computer, two electronic control amplifiers and a rotary mechanical actuator attached to each engine power control mechanisms.  The current system components suffer from obsolescence and diminishing vendor sources.  System components were designed with 1950s technologies and as such suffer additionally from circuit latencies which inhibit precise throttle response requirements.  The EA-6B Program Office seeks design remedies which will eliminate these reliability, supportability, and performance shortfalls. 

Currently the EA-6B Program Office has contracted with BAE Systems to adapt a non-developmental digital flight control computer (DFCC) for integration into the EA-6B.  This DFCC will be integrated to aircraft interfaces and replace the current air navigation computer (ANC).  This ANC replacement project is referred to as the EA-6B Digital Flight Control System (DFCS) Upgrade Program.  Embedded in this non-developmental DFCC are components to perform requisite APC functionality.  The components (circuits, drivers, and processor capacity) are embedded on internal printed circuit cards in the DFCC.  DFCS program resource constraints limited implementation of APC functionality when the DFCS program was formally approved and funded.  It is largely thought that due to the proprietary design of the DFCC that vendors other than BAE Systems for APC functionality are not available which can embed APC requirements in the DFCC and eliminate separate weapons replaceable assemblies.

This program is currently unfunded.  Future program funding status is to be determined.

Responses to this RFI should include: 1) A summary outline of performance specification within the DFCC to meet APC functional requirement. 2) A description of hardware and software changes needed to meet the functional requirement. 3) A ROM estimate of vendor non-recurring costs.  4) Any other information at vendor discretion but limited to 5 printed pages at not less than 10 pitch font.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking ONLY 8 (a) business sources under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 512191 who have GSA Schedules who can provide ongoing maintenance and ancillary equipment for the SSA Interactive Video Tele-training (IVT) network.  The IVT network provides real-time training via satellite broadcast to students at SSA offices who are geographically dispersed throughout the continental United States including Puerto Rico, Hawaii and the United States Virgin Islands.  The IVT network is one-way video and two-way audio.  Students interact directly with instructor through the One-Touch viewer response system (VRS).  The IVT network uses satellite as the media for transmitting the training broadcasts to SSA’s Field Offices (FO).  Satellite services and satellite equipment are a separate entity and are not part of this requirement.   SSA’s IVT network consists of approximately 1,700 classrooms/locations, broadcast studios (4 in Baltimore, Maryland Headquarters; one each in Kansas City, Missouri; Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and a mini studio in New York, New York), editing rooms, one Visual Communications Control Center (VCCC) and a video wall.  The Headquarters’ studio(s) transmit broadcasts through SSA’s local services called “Synchronous Optical Network (SONET).”  Each regional studio transmits training broadcasts over two T1 circuitry, equating to three Megahertz of bandwidth.  All studio training broadcasts are transmitted to the VCCC, then to the satellite uplink system, and lastly, it is dispersed to the downlinks where the IVT classrooms are located in approximately 1,700 FO’s.  The majority of FO’s have one IVT classroom; however, there are some FO’s with two or more IVT classrooms.  Each classroom is equipped with a TV monitor, a videocassette recorder, a One Touch site controller and One Touch viewer response units. The broadcast studios are equipped with a host One Touch computer, Assistant Station, Parkervision Expert Camera, Elmo Visual Presenter graphic camera, Chromakey switches, audio mix equipment, Report Analysis Program and other necessary electronics for the instructor to conduct an effective training session. The computers collect data generated from the students, such as test results. The VCCC manages all SSA video based services, including satellite services, troubled shooting and fault isolation. The VCCC is also responsible for the SSA campus cable TV network and controls the reinsertion of video signals which provides closed circuit services to the SSA Headquarters’ campus in Baltimore. SSA is seeking sources which can provide maintenance and support services including ancillary equipment during the principle period of maintenance (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local time) with a four (4) hour response for emergency maintenance and an eight (8) hour response time for remedial maintenance for all 1,700 sites. SSA also requires on-site maintenance support at its Headquarters location for fourteen (14) hours per day (7 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.) Monday through Friday. Companies must have the capability to provide maintenance support for the estimated 1,700 sites through the contract life.  Companies must be able to provide One Touch software support and upgrades, a tracking system for trouble calls and security suitability. Companies must have technical experience, knowledge and training certification for all the equipment in the IVT network including servicing Frame Relay/ATM connectivity to the One Touch IVT equipment in the classrooms, studios and VCCC.  Vendors must provide a copy of their appropriate GSA Schedule.

Vendors shall also provide information about their company and include the number and qualifications of employees, detailing previous related experience and projects similar in scope to SSA’s requirement including past performance data. Locations where similar equipment has been installed and maintained by the vendor shall also be provided. Vendors must provide verifiable proof that they will be able to meet the maintenance performance requirements through a national on-call maintenance system.  No cost or pricing data is required or requested. This is not a request for proposal, and the Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited or received. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the source data received.  Any interested organizations must submit appropriate data in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement to Ed Casswell at ed.casswell@ssa.gov .

<SUBJECT>Z -- BASE SUPPLY FUNCTION (REQUEST FOR INFORMATION)
<DESC>This office is currently in the early acquisition planning process for the follow-on contract for the Base Supply Function contract.  There are several issues that the Government is considering and the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to get comments from industry.  
First:  The Government believes that the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services, adequately describes the scope of work to be performed.  The last contract was SIC code 8744, Facilities Support Management Service, and FSC Z999 Miscellaneous.  
Second:  The current contract was awarded through full and open competition procedures after a OMB Circular A-76 Cost Study and was not set-aside for small business.  The Government would like to consider some kind of small business set-aside and is interested to see what small business respondents are seriously interested in this acquisition.  Partnering and joint ventures are encouraged.
Third:  The Government would like to utilize a 10 year period of performance for the follow-on contract but is not sure that industry is able to have pricing information to account for costs during the latter years of the contract.  The Government will consider some type of economic price adjustment if industry can support the rationale or other recommended length for the period of performance.  The estimated value of the contract for the 10 year period would be $36M.
The solicitation number will be FA8101-05-R-0011.  There is no expected release date for the solicitation at this time.  The Contracting Officer may post a draft Performance Work Statement for comment on FedBizOpps.   The synopsis and formal Request For Proposal will be posted on FedBizOpps.  The information gathered as a result from this Request For Information may be considered market research.  It would be most helpful to provide your comments by COB 24 Mar 2005, however, comments to this RFI will be accepted until release of the formal RFP.
All interested parties are requested to respond with comments to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Shaw, at michelle.shaw@tinker.af.mil.  Phone calls are discouraged.

<SUBJECT>R -- WV NATIONAL GUARD JOINT INTERAGENCY TRAINING CENTER - EAST(JITC-E) Document Development
<DESC>The US Army PEOSTRI currently has a requirement to support the West Virginia National Guard Bureau (WVNGB) with the development of documentation to support the acquisition cycle of the Joint Interagency Training Center-East (JITC-E).  PEOSTRI intends to issue a sole-source contract to Conaway Group, a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) located in Alexandria, VA, on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis for the development of the final Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) and the development of the draft Technology Development Strategy (TDS) for the JITC-E located at Camp Dawson, WV to support a Milestone A, Concept Development Decision, by June 2005 and begin preparations for the Milestone B decision.  The period of performance will be from award through 30 September 2005.   The Government currently estimates the value of this 6-month effort to be approximately $150,000.  

Conaway Group is the only contractor with the skills, abilities, and program knowledge to support development of the required documents in the time frame necessary.  The Government is currently seeking completion of the ICD document by early June 2005 and a draft of the TDS document no later than August 2005.  The ICD document is critical to obtaining Milestone A approval by the end of June 2005.  The TDS document is a required element that goes toward Milestone B approval by 30 September 2005.  Absence of these documents on the required dates translates to a serious delay, as the program will not be allowed to continue progressing without these approved Milestone decisions.  It is most critical to insure that all aspects of the required documentation for the JITC-E is accomplished in an efficient and timely manner and in consonance with other DOD and Federal programs of the JITC-E.  Any such delays would have a serious and unacceptable impact on DOD, Army and NGB as related to protecting the homeland and winning the Global War on Terrorism.  

The Government estimates that it would take at least a six-month lead time to bring another contractor up to a point where these documents could be developed.

The models mus t be in the correct format required by and consistent in structure with other models developed to be used with/by the Parametric Automated Cost Engineering System (PACES) and Remedial Action Cost Engineering Requirements (RACER) software applications. The successful offeror shall have the functional/technical knowledge of developing parametric construction models, programming software logic for and usage of the PACES software, cost engineering for Military; Hazardous, Toxic and Radioactive Waste; and Civil Works projects as well as instruction expertise on the PACES software.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis of intent is to give notice of the Governments intent make a sole source award and is not a request for quotes.  Contractors who can provide the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center with the above services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response on company letterhead which includes, as a minimum, the processed credentials and qualifications, any applicable pricing d ata and any additional information indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement.  The contractor must have at least five (5) years experience in construction estimating model development and have rights to use the PACES and RACER modeli ng methodology.  The parametric approach differs from traditional cost estimating methods by allowing the user to input a minimum amount of information to create a cost estimate.  The PACES/RACER software is an integrated Windows-based budgeting and cost e stimating system that prepares parametric cost estimates for construction projects. The contractor must also have the knowledge to create the models in the correct structure format that can be utilizable by the PACES software.  In addition, the contractor must have at least three (3) years of experience in providing instruction on the PACES/RACER software for the primary purpose of cost estimating on construction related projects.

<SUBJECT>NETCENTS CONTRACTS AS DOD ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AGREEMENTS (ESAS) WITH SELECTED SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS FOR INFORMATION ASSURANCE (IA) COMMERCIAL ITEMS
<DESC>Headquarters Operations and Sustainment Systems Group (HQ OSSG), Maxwell Air Force Base (MAFB)- Gunter Annex, AL 36114 intends to ask prime contractors of Air Force Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) contracts to provide more favorable prices, terms and conditions of selected publishers' commercial software and related services, such as software maintenance, so the NETCENTS Contracts become the Enterprise Software Agreements (ESAs) to fulfill recurring Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. Coast Guard and intelligence community requirements in the commercial software market category of Information Assurance (IA).  IA provides security related functions to detect and correct vulnerabilities, and institute layered defenses against non-authorized penetrations of information systems and networks.  The NETCENTS contracts already include information assurance software and software maintenance and provide for use by DoD and other Government agencies. <br><br> The United States Air Force (USAF) participates in the DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) of the DoD as the lead agency for IA and has designated HQ OSSG as the Software Product Manager for establishing ESAs in the commercial software market category of IA.  Departments and agencies of the DoD must fulfill acquisition requirements for commercial software and related services, such as software maintenance in accordance with the DoD ESI.  The ESI, led by the DoD Chief Information Officer develops processes for DoD-wide software asset management.  ESAs are agreements or contracts used to acquire designated commercial software or related services such as software maintenance.  They are established with contractors to allow DoD to obtain favorable terms and pricing for commercial software and related services.   ESI does not dictate the products or services to be acquired (see website at http://www.don-imit.navy.mil/esi). <br><br> NETCENTS contracts are multi-agency indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts for Network-Centric Information Technology commercial-off-the-shelf products, security (firewalls, vpn, encryption and decryption, etc.) and system solutions (to include but not be limited to engineering, software development, integration, installation, testing, warranty, training, operations and maintenance), and the hardware, software and materials to design, install, support and maintain Network-Centric Information Technology, Networking, Telephony and Security (NCITNTS) systems.  The contracts specifically address information assurance as part of the scope of work.  Responsible sources seeking subcontracting opportunities should contact NETCENTS contractors to explore business opportunities, including: Telos Corporation, 19886 Ashburn Rd., Ashburn VA 20147-2358, (703) 724-3800; Northrop Grumman Information Technology, Inc., 7575 Colshire Drive, McLean VA 22102-7508, 703-556-1713; NCI Information Systems, Inc., 11730 Plaza America Drive, Reston VA 20190-4764, (703) 707-6900; Multimax, Inc., 237 Interstate Park Drive, Montgomery AL  36109-5404, (334) 239-8005; Lockheed Martin Corporation, 9500 Goodwin Dr., Manassas VA 20110-4147, (703) 367-2972; General Dynamics Network Systems, Inc., 77 A St, Needham Heights MA 02494-2806, (781) 455-4029; The Centech Group, Inc., 400 Interstate Park Drive, Suite 401, Montgomery, AL 36109, 334-277-5767; and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean VA 22102-3838, (703) 902-5681. <br><br> Send comments in writing to Cynthia Crews at Cynthia.Crews@Gunter.AF.Mil or mail responses to Attn: Cynthia Crews, 501 E.

(vi)	DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

1.	STATEMENT OF SERVICES – GENERAL

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Defense Cost and Resource Center (DCARC) and the Programming and Fiscal Economics Division (PFED) of Program Analysis & Evaluation /Resource Analysis (PA&E/RA) are co-locating into a new facility and require a multipurpose conference room.  The multipurpose conference room must be capable of handling video teleconferencing (VTC), audio conferencing, presentations, accommodate training, web-based and network collaboration, multicast video streaming, and video recording.

DCARC is responsible for implementing and overseeing the Department of Defense (DoD)'s Cost and Software Data Reporting System (CSDR) in direct support of Federal Statute DCARC CSDR Compliance Activities include training and compliance reviews.  The DCARC staff conducts between eight and ten trips per year to conduct training and to meet with contractors, program managers, and DCMA/DCAA personnel to improve CSDR reporting compliance.  While these trips are helpful in improving compliance, there are many more locations and organizations that could be visited to further enhance compliance.  The DCARC Staff could easily schedule approximately 24 to 30 such trips per year were it not for travel budget constraints.  Using VTC would allow the DCARC staff to increase the number of training events and meetings it holds "face-to-face" without increasing the travel budget for the organization.  In addition, an essential element of CSDR Compliance is timely reviews, coordination, and approvals of Cost and Software Reporting Plans, Contractor Cost Data Reports, and Software Resource Data Reports.  

PFED is responsible for meeting the Secretary of Defense’s legal requirement to submit to Congress a Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) reflecting the estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations reflected in the President’s budget.  PFED accomplishes this mission by using web-based automation tools to collect, coordinate, validate, verify, and certify FYDP data.  This approach requires the PFED staff to conduct year-round hands-on computer training for all DoD Components and Combatant Commands for approximately 200 people.  Additionally PFED supports internal Department data collection systems that are used to coordinate and collect the Program Objective Memoranda (POM) that components submit to OSD for the Secretary to use in evaluating and resourcing programs.  The system used to collect POM data is used by every Component and nearly every Defense Agency. Annual training is usually provided for at least 200 people across the Department.

A multipurpose conference room with VTC capability would eliminate most travel requirements for either the PFED staff or trainees, would allow DCARC and PFED to reach a larger portion of its user group both within and outside the DC area, and improve CSDR reporting Compliance and DCARC efficiency. A multipurpose conference room with a VTC system could also be a resource for other PA&E organizations in Crystal City and would enhance the DCARC/PFED facility's utility as a contingency work location for PA&E staff.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

2.1 OBJECTIVE 

The purpose of this statement of work is to bring in the experience, knowledge, and engineering skills to engineer, procure, install, and configure a new multipurpose conference room.  This includes purchasing needed hardware/software that is not provided.  Support activities include providing documentation, training, and support for 1 year.   

 2.2 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance for this work is 1 year although multipurpose room completion shall be within 60 days, which shall commence upon award of the contract and the completion of Crystal Gateway North construction.  Upon award of the contract the contractor may begin working if construction is near completion and it is agreed upon by facility focal point. 

3 DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

3.0 GENERAL

OSD/PA&E/Resource Analysis is building a new facility on the 2nd floor of 201 12th Street, Crystal Gateway North.  Design plans include a multipurpose room (size ~20 X 25) that is required to conduct training, presentations, web-based and network collaboration, video teleconferencing, audio conferencing, video streaming, video recording and to serve as a contingency of operation site for Resource Analysis.  Some electrical work has already been included in the design to accommodate a ceiling mounted projector, dimmer switches for lighting and jacks in the floor for four floor jacks to support electrical and data cabling on the tables.

3.1 Security

The Contractor shall familiarize his employees with the aforementioned fire regulations, location of fire reporting telephones near work sites, and correct fire reporting procedures.  The Contractor and his employees shall be cognizant of and observe all requirements for handling and storing combustible supplies and materials, daily disposal of combustible waste, trash, etc.

<DESC>THIS FOLLOWING IS AN 8(A) SET-ASIDE PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 19.805- COMPETITIVE 8(A). The government intends to acquire Accounting Support Services on a LABOR HOUR BASIS utilizing FAR Part 15 Negotiated Competitive Procurement procedures. This is a synopsis for RFP YA1323-05-RP-0007. The U.S. Census Bureau requires Accounting Support Services from Offices of Certified Public Accountants. The NAICS Code is 541211- Offices of Certified Public Accountants, with a Small Business Size Standard of $7.0 M. The U.S. Census Bureau Finance Division (FIN) requires a contractor to provide a wide variety of technical financial management and accounting support services. The contractor shall provide technical support services including, but not limited to, ongoing identification and incorporation of "Best Practices" into FIN’s business processes and monthly reconciliation-related activities.  The ultimate goal is to provide assistance to FIN staff to significantly improve both how it operates and improve staff functionality.  Currently seven commercial contractors are assisting three government employees with the following activities: reconciling, reviewing, validating, and/or adjusting all general ledger proprietary/budgetary accounts as necessary. The objective is for the Finance Division to become a "best in class" and “most efficient" operating entity.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks: 1) Reconciliation of General Ledger Accounts, 2) Reimbursable Support: Project Deactivation, 3) Reimbursable Support: Debt Management Cleanup, 4) Reimbursable Support: Deposit Account Cleanup, 5) Budgetary and Proprietary Relationship Support, 6) Financial Statement Preparation, 7) Audit Support, 8) FACTS II Reporting, and 9) Business Process Alignment Activities. The government will make an award decision on a best-value basis, with technical factors weighted more important than price. The technical evaluation factors are, in order of importance: 1) Technical Approach and 2) Organizational Resources and Key Personnel, weighted equally as most important, and 3) Corporate Experience and Past Performance, less important than 1) and 2). Price will be evaluated in terms of Cost/Price Completeness and Accuracy, Price Realism, Price Reasonableness, Price Risk, and Weighted Average Labor Rate. A full copy of Request for Proposal (RFP) Solicitation No: YA1323-05-RP-0007 can be found at  http://www.census.gov/procur/www/opportunities.html.

1.  Will all of the classes require one classroom or will more rooms be required in the future?  The synopsis/solicitation states that the Government has a requirement for multiple computer classroom facilities.  We require the option to schedule more than one room at the same time.

2.  Is the 12 block radius the maximum limit or can the facility be within 14 blocks of the Whitehouse?  A 14 block radius is acceptable.

3.  The connectivity requirement is given as a T-1 plus backup connectivity.  Does the backup also have to be a T-1 line?  Yes.

4.  Are the dates given firm or will the Government reserve the right to change dates?  The dates provided are firm.  The Government reserves the right the change dates based upon our customers needs.  Technical proposals should include a cancellation policy.

<DESC>The following amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation HC1047-05-R-4020 is posted to address some questions submitted by potential offerors, to revise information provided in the amendment dated 16 March 2005, and to indicate that a posting of additional information has been accomplished as of 17 March 2005 showing the additional one (1) year option period.

Question 1: Is this a new requirement?
Response: This requirement is quite similar to the effort awarded under contract HC1047-04-C-4036, only one additional task has been added.

Question 2: If not, who is the current incumbent?
Response: The current incumbent is GS5, LLC.

Question 3: What is the contract number and award value?

Question 4: When was it awarded and when is it expected to end?

Question 5: In regard to the current contract with GS5 LLC, is GS5 LLC the incumbent to solicitation HC1047-05-R-4020?

PROJECT TITLE: COLOMBIA: HYDROCARBONS SECTOR DEVELOPMENT DEFINITIONAL MISSION

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will:

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4	provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues. 

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  
 
2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT (3-5 PAGES)

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on viability of the project(s), financing options, U.S. company interest in the project (s), a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

 
2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.

The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

This $35,000 Definitional Mission will evaluate the terms, feasibility, and impact of oil and gas projects proposed by the Government of Colombia and provide policy making advice in the hydrocarbons sector.  The potential assistance would contribute to Colombia’s demonstrated recommitment to developing its hydrocarbon resources and attracting new investment.  The project proposals were presented by three potential grantees in the Government of Colombia (GOC): the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH), and Ecopetrol (the state-owned operating oil company).

MEM proposed the following area of technical assistance:

1.)	Development of Biodiesel Regulations:  The objective is to support the renewable energy policy of the GOC by developing biodiesel regulations to stimulate local production using palm oil.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance will be determined by the DM.

The DM Consultant will also work with ANH to assess potential USTDA technical assistance in the following areas:

2.)	Investment Strategy Resident Advisor:  The objective is to support the ANH in developing a strategy to utilize its $70 million investment fund.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance will be determined by the DM.

3.)	Heavy Crudes Policy:  The objective is to support the development of the GOC’s upstream strategy and regulations on heavy crudes.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance will be determined by the DM.

Finally, the DM Consultant will work with Ecopetrol to assess potential USTDA feasibility study assistance for the following project:

4.)	Natural Gas Pipeline Connection with Panama:  The objective of a feasibility study is to evaluate the construction of a Caribbean-routed natural gas pipeline to Panama.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance will be determined by the DM.

The DM Consultant is expected to evaluate additional areas of potential USTDA assistance in the hydrocarbons sector.
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice for solicitation number W91ZLK-05-T-0359 is hereby amended to extend due date to March 21 2005 no later than 12:00 PM EST.  The following question has been asked. Q.The 15 micron detector pitch specification is negligible when you factor in the optic source utilized with the camera head.  For example - a 640x512 coupled with the right optic can provide you the same results as a 15 micron pitch instrument.  Can you c larify what type of optic will be used with the imager?  A.The imager will be used with a variety of refractive lenses. A smaller detector pitch will allow better resolution when combined with components designed for it, so the 15 micron spec must be met.
