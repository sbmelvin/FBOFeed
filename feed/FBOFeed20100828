Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contract Specialist at the address stated below. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 10 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Bio-Logic USA, LLC.

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Large Scale Coordinate Metrology Group, intends to negotiate with Hexagon Metrology Inc.; North Kingstown, RI, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the services described below.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The NIST Large Scale Coordinate Metrology Group (LSCMG) is in need of a new software package for one of its coordinate measuring machines (the "REI CMM"). There is no longer technical support for the machine's current software and NIST needs the replacement software to match the existing software that is run on its other coordinate measuring machine (the "RS-5 CMM"). Currently installed on the RS-5 CMM is PC-DMIS software. The manufacturer is Wilcox Associates, Inc., and recent market research shows that the software package is only available through its parent company and distributor Hexagon Metrology.<br /><br />Running PC-DMIS on the REI CMM will allow group members to become efficient using a single software package, and be able to run either machine. Since many members of the group have already been trained in the use of PC-DMIS software, and have used it extensively since that training period, LSCMG will be able to run the REI CMM immediately once the new software is installed. Learning a new software package will require many hours of training to learn to run the software efficiently and effectively. NIST has already put a high-degree of time into learning and gaining expertise in using the current software.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334513. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Hexagon Metrology for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized by Hexagon Metrology to do so may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before September 3, 2010 at 5 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

<DESC>The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T), Patuxent River, MD are soliciting proposal abstracts for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles. Solicitation Number: N68335-10-R-0303 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Topics include development of new Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Advanced Aircraft Power Systems, Fuel Technology, and Aircraft Energy Conservation and Environmental Compliance. Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication "Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Years 2010 &amp;2011". The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at: www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored. Requests for this publication can also be made by email to: Mr. Keith Welge, keith.welge@navy.mil. This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 29 August 2011in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal. WPs and Proposals shall be submitted by electronic means only to: Mr. Keith Welge, email: keith.welge@navy.mil. There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regard to this requirement. The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small business, Women-Owned Small Business and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.

In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not
accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and
remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this

Government takes physical possession.
(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are

(p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or
division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in
performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the
responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its
intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of
subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the
responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient
documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this
clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the
absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment"
paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual
payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment
of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments,
including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 	(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual
confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423

601-613).
(b) Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or related to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.
(c) "Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of
the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the
adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this
contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the
payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher,
invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim
under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with
the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability
or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a
written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written
decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not
been submitted as all or part of a claim.
(iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith;
that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that
the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor
believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of
the Contractor."
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For
Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide
the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the
Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use
alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor
shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting
the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that
payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to
claims having defective certifications, as defined in (FAR) 48 CFR 33.201, interest shall be paid
from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims
shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the ACT, which is
applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the
rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency
of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment
of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments,
including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be

Through these programs, the Corporation is working to build a culture of citizenship, service, and responsibility in America. </span></p>

The SAA made several changes to the National Service Trust's legislation. These include tying the amount of the full time education award to the amount of the Pell Grant, expanding the definition of qualified educational institutions which may receive payment from the Education Award to include institutions and establishments that have been approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the use of veterans' educational benefits, expanding the number of possible service terms by allowing a member to earn up to and including the value of two full time education awards, allowing the education award to be transferred under certain conditions, and creating two new types of service that can result in two new types of education awards: the Summer of Service and Silver Scholar programs.</span></p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate Offers:  Technical Capability, Price and Past Performance.   Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Definitions are as follows:  ACCEPTABLE:  To be rated acceptable, the offerors technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements.  UNACCEPTABLE:  A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable.  Past Performance will be evaluated as high risk, medium risk and low risk with definitions as follows:  Unsatisfactory / High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records under the various factor evaluations, or offerors record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>VA777C07273
<ARCHDATE>09122010
<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition 


1.  Contracting Activity

     Department of Veterans Affairs
     Employee Education System
     #1 Jefferson Barracks Dr, Bldg 50 RM 1N76
      St Louis Mo 63125

2.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This requirement is for training and accreditation of VA nurses and physicians.  The following training and accreditation is being requested: Clinician-Patient Communication, Difficult Clinician Patient Relationship, Choices & Changes as well as Disclosing Unanticipated Outcomes and Medical Errors training.  

3.  Description of Service and Supplies:  
This training program is a series of faculty development courses specifically designed to provide Physicians, Nurses, and Nurse Practitioners with communication techniques to improve the quality of health by enhancing the health care communication process.  This program is a continuing train-the-trainer to develop VA Clinicians as faculty in order to provide VHA wide Clinician-Patient Communication training to all VAMC clinical staff.  This training has been provided over the past three years and it is the VA's intent to provide consistent training and continue to provide staff with the associated accreditations.  

This agreement will procure a total of 16 participants to attend the Clinician-Patient Communication Patient Centered Medical Home (CPC PCMH) faculty development course.  The total anticipated cost of this requirement is $88,200.00. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of  41 U.S.C. 253 ( c )(1) and FAR 6.302-1.

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  
VHA Employee Education System (EES) has historically provided specific communication courses to VHA physicians and clinicians in response to the agency's strategic initiative for customer service.  It would take a new company more than two years and a significant undetermined cost to develop course materials and faculty development to the requirements as specified in the VA strategic Initiatives for Patient Care and Clinician Healthcare Communication. 

In May 2004, IHC began the process of certifying faculty for the Healthcare Communication Series, and is the sole certifying entity to provide the required clinician certification.  The certification process has been a quality check to insure the workshop is taught consistently throughout the VA system.  The Clinician-Patient Communication Training Series is the foundational and primary program for the VA's customer service initiatives for Physicians, Psychologist, Nurses, and Nurse Practitioners.  Research supports the fact that customer satisfaction is directly linked to the patient's perception of quality of communication with his/her health care provider.

6.  Description of Market Research:  No efforts were made to solicit other vendors.    

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.   Cost and pricing data not obtained.  IAW FAR 15.403-1(a) cost and pricing data was not obtained.  The contracting officer has evaluated the price paid for the same or similar services in the past for the requested service and determined that the price is determined fair and reasonable.

8.  Other Interested Sources:  None

9.  Future barriers to competition:  VHA will continue to monitor the market place and the accreditation opportunities.  

  10.  I certify that this justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.
