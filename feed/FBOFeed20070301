<DESC>The Major Programs Team in the Support Equipment and Vehicles Contracting Office (GBKBB) within the 642d Combat Sustainment Group (CBSG) is responsible for procuring Computerized Radiography (CR) digital imaging systems for Nondestructive Inspections (NDI) in military aircraft maintenance environments. The imaging systems will detect abnormalities, stress areas, and other such physical findings in a variety of metallic and non-metallic aircraft products.

The Radiography Digital system, uses photostimulable phosphor imaging plates as the collection media for radiographic data. The system operates in the same fashion as x-ray films used for the purpose of NDI evaluation, except that the phosphors are capable of being erased and re-used. An automated programmable method of extracting the data and subsequently erasing the phosphors and a method for displaying and storing the images shall be provided by the contractor.

The solicitation will contain a line item for a first production unit and associated testing. As the system is commercial and of the type commonly found in metallurgy laboratories and precision machining facilities in the private as well as public sector, the testing will be minimal and will serve to confirm that the system adheres to the requirements of the Purchase Description. 

Request for Proposal Components:  It is expected that a Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) will be utilized to evaluate potential offerors.  The RFP will provide full instructions and evaluation criteria.  The resultant contract is expected to be a 3-year, requirements type contract, with one basic year and 2 Option Years.  The basic year will include Pre-Production Units (one Type I and one Type II) and associated Data line items.  The proposal will include Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs) for each year as follows:  Basic Year: 12, Option I: 12 and Option II: 12.

FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part, Contracting by Negotiation will be used.

It is anticipated the RFP will be released on Fed Biz Opps on or about 12 March 2007 as Full and Open  Offeror's proposal's will be due 30 days after posting.

Interested Offerors are encouraged to register for updates to this solicitation on Fed Biz Opps.  All questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the primary or secondary points of contact.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The NAVAIR Depot (NADEP) Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to procure contractor support in performing and managing Life Cycle Management (LCM) activities of the NAVAIR Document Management/Workflow (DM/WF) Center of Excellence (COE).  Document Management (DM) technology is concerned with managing the lifecycle of electronic documents.  Workflow (WF) is the computerized facilitation or automation of a business process, in whole or in part.  DM/WF eliminates the need for paper and it provides instantaneous status of every task as defined by a business process.  

The NADEP is an aviation repair facility owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) and staffed by civilian employees and military personnel.  The NADEP overhauls and repairs designated airframes, engines, and components and provides field teams and manufacturing, engineering, and logistic support services.  The facility is located in Eastern North Carolina adjacent to the town of Havelock.

The contractor shall provide DM/WF COE Program Management support, perform Definition and Start-up support, define all system components and site-specific architectures that dictate hardware and software requirements, define and record the architectural design of the system and the traceability between system components and system requirements, integrate code and design/develop specific workflow applications to produce a product that fulfils the stated functionality without altering the design and functionality of existing processes, and perform deployment and testing of the product.  The contractor shall also provide day-to-day operations support, defect resolution, troubleshooting and periodic updates to maintain and/or enhance existing systems, and also manage application shutdown.

The current Document Management/ Work Flow Tool for DM/WF development is e.POWER, for which NAVAIR currently maintains 33,500 licenses.  It is recognized that it may not be a case of “one size fits all” and a new set of requirements may fall outside the bounds of the existing assets.  Should software other than e.POWER be proposed as a solution for workflow requirements under this contract, the proposal must include a plan for acquiring FAM approval, interoperability with existing e.POWER processes, and providing the required number of licenses.  The cost for this software must be reflected in the cost proposal.

This procurement is being released as a Full and Open competition, but will be amended to a Total Small Business Set Aside if two or more acceptable offers are received from Small Business Concerns.  The complete Solicitation will be released on or about 14 August 2006, and may be viewed at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) home page at the following web address:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  Please check the web site often for updates and Amendments to the Solicitation.

<DESC>The sole source contract with BAE Systems Spectral Solutions, LLC will be the result of an Office of the Secretary of Defense competition for Joint Concepts Technology Demonstration projects.  The JMMES project was selected.  The project is a continuation of R&D efforts that will incorporate improvements to the precursor LASH (Littoral Airborne Sensor-Hyperspectral) and the existing EPAS (Electro-Optic Passive ASW System) system to extend present antisubmarine warfare capabilities into new missions for mine countermeasures, maritime interdiction operations, surface warfare, search & rescue, illicit crop detection, and marine mammal mitigation.  It is anticipated that the current hardware configuration of EPAS will be redesigned and  prototypes modified and constructed to improve search rate capabilities and the acceptance of a wider range of military/civilian aircraft such as fixed winged, helicopters, airships and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV?s).  Software improvements will also be made to incorporate new target and clutter characteristics.  Test and evaluation support will be provided to demonstrate to Combatant commands and international users the value of the JMMES system under operational conditions and circumstances.

The NAVFAC LANT AOR includes the entire continental United States (CONUS), Caribbean, and outside continental United States (OCONUS), including Europe, Africa, Western Asia, and South America. Some task orders may address non-Navy sites or other Navy regions outside the NAVFAC LANT AOR to support joint service or global efforts.  The primary tasks anticipated under this contract include developing Basic Facility Requirements (BFR) documents and performing Engineering Evaluations: Basic Facility Requirements (BFRs) are developed to determine what facilities are required to perform the assigned mission. The contractor will calculate BFRs by Category Code, Special Area, and Host and its tenants for each site. BFRs are the result of an analysis of projected mission and base/tenant loading, operational considerations, activity and surrounding community conditions, and sound professional judgment. BFRs are intended to be the minimum facilities necessary for efficient operation and are not directly constrained by anticipated funding levels, individual operational priorities or inefficiencies in existing facilities. An Engineering Evaluation (EE) is an on-site inspection of an Activitys buildings and structures that is performed jointly by the contractor and the activity.  During an EE, existing facilities are inspected to verify current occupancy, floor areas and usage, and to assess their ability to satisfy designated present uses. Data will include photos of buildings.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, in conjunction with the Dynamic Target Engagement and Enhanced Sensor Capabilities Future Naval Capability (FNC) sponsored and managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is soliciting applied research and advanced technology demonstration proposals for the development and flight demonstration of an innovative, small, efficient, heavy-fuels propulsion system suitable for small, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is anticipated that up to $8.0M over two years will be available for this solicitation, subject to appropriation and approval by ONR. The program seeks to develop and demonstrate technology for a heavy fuel propulsion system for small tactical UAVs. The propulsion system prototype should significantly improve upon current system performance suitable to a technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 within 24 months. TRL 6 for this program is defined as a flight demonstration of the propulsion system prototype in a representative unmanned aerial vehicle. The propulsion system developed shall be suitable for flight testing on a small UAV to be determined and supplied by the government team at a later date. It is the intent of the government team to provide the aircraft and integration requirements prior to the invitation to submit full proposals. The final configuration shall be technically suitable for transition into the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program acquisition phase. The propulsion system shall be defined as all the components, sub-components, and auxiliary equipment necessary to operate the engine except for electrical power conditioning equipment, the fuel, fuel supply reservoir, fuel tubing from the reservoir to the fuel pump or fuel manifold, and fuel tank heater. Individual technologies may address such technical areas as combustion, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics; fuel delivery and atomization; intake and exhaust systems; fluid dynamics; advanced materials and structures; thermal management systems; power generation systems; mechanical systems; controls, accessories and engine health management systems; drive train and gearbox; and propellers. The use of integrated electrical power generation design features is highly encouraged. Specifics of the engine configuration, such as if it is required to be a pusher or puller, will be provided prior to the start of development with the determination of the flight demonstration vehicl!  e. Materials characterization, tailoring, processing, and behavior may be included in this effort to the extent that it is related to the development of advanced engine components or issues associated with durability and shipboard suitability. The desired technical effort should consist of one or more advanced technology component development tasks that may include conceptual, preliminary, and detailed design, fabrication, assembly, instrumentation, component rig or bench testing, engine demonstrator testing on both the ground and in flight, data analysis, and reporting. It is likely that individual offerors will not have the complete skills to successfully execute the program in its entirety. Therefore, business-to-business or business-to-academia coordination or partnerships are highly encouraged to improve analysis, design, and testing capabilities as well as pre-production design and planning. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for consultation and code development to integrate a library of modular, fast, direct (MFD) computational electromagnetic (CEM) tools into EIGER (Electromagnetic Interactions GEneRalized).  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from the University of Kentucky (UK). The principal investigator has demonstrated the world's first order Nlog(N) fast, direct solution algorithm for general computational electromagnetic (CEM) problems of low-to-moderate frequencies. The new library of tools circumvent many previous limitations of order Nlog(N) complexity. The organizing principle consists of representing general electromagnetic solution operators in a complete basis of localized solution modes, known as LOGOS modes, that satisfy global boundary conditions. The LOGOS concept was solely developed at the University of Kentucky. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 16, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>For more than 50 years Edwards Air Force Base has been distinguished by more major milestones in flight than any other place on earth. Covering nearly 301,000 acres, Edwards is located in the Mojave Desert, adjacent to Rogers Dry Lakebed. Even though remote, Edwards is home to military and their families, as well as employer to over 8,000 civilian employees. 

Many military families cope with separation and frequent moves through the love and care of their furry friends. Bark in the park is a special event at Edwards AFB for pets and their families. This is a uniquely targeted event for companies looking to expand customer awareness to their pet loving military demographic.

Sponsorship is fundamental to the success of this event. Edwards AFB invites you to join in supporting pet health and relations by becoming a commercial sponsor. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. 

In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure. The level of exposure is determined by the level of sponsorship, with all sponsors prominently acknowledged throughout the event. Sponsor exposure may include name and logo recognition on all event print media, including posters, signage, and banners, brochures, pictures and media coverage. More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered. Request for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than 20 April 2007. All offers will be considered.

Unfortunately we will not be able to accept offers for sponsorship from any contractor, including their affiliates, subcontract arrangements, teaming partners, or join venture partners who are currently or intending to participate in any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) or who will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,00 or more. If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the government.

This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non appropriated funds instrumentality of the United States Government and does not obligate appropriated funds of the Government.

<DESC>For over 50 years Edwards Air Force Base has been distinguished by more major milestones in flight than any other place on earth. Covering nearly 301,000 acres, Edwards is located in the Mojave Desert, adjacent to Rogers Dry Lakebed. Even though remote, Edwards is home to military and their families, as well as employer to over 8,000 civilian employees. 

There is something for everyone at the base wide Fall Festival which draws crowds of 3,000 - 4,000 people of all ages. In addition to the food, rides, and musical entertainment there will be hay bales, pumpkin carving and maybe even a mechanical bull- everything you would expect from a hometown fall celebration. This is a great opportunity to raise customer awareness of your company with this exclusive military demographic.

Sponsorship is fundamental to the success of this event. Edwards AFB invites you to join in supporting the moral, welfare and recreation of our military and their dependents by becoming a commercial sponsor for the Fall Festival. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. 
	 
In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure. The level of exposure is determined by the level of sponsorship, with all sponsors prominently acknowledged throughout the event. Sponsor exposure may include name and logo recognition on all event print media, including posters, signage, and banners, brochures, pictures and media coverage. More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered. Request for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than 29 August 2007. All offers will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command on behalf of the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program intends to procure on a sole source basis a commercial, FDA-licensed Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (VIGIV) to treat severe reactions to smallpox  vaccinations.  The intended source is Cangene Corporation, 104 Chancellor Matheson Road, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  It is anticipated a contract will be issued for a one year base period for ordering product and 6 options periods to procure additional p roduct as required, for a maximum possible total of seven years.  This contract will be issued using other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Cangene Corporation is the only known FDA license holder for VIGIV which currently has the manufacturing capability to maintain the Department of Defense's (DoD's) requirement for a stockpile of 300-1,200 Troo p Equivalent Doses (TEDs). DoD will require contractor to collect source plasma, complete production of final FDA-approved VIGIV, store and distribute DoD stockpile, and provide all materials and documentation required to meet FDA Post-Marketing Commitment s.  This is not a request for competitive proposals but parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to furnish these supplies must provide in writing, factual information which clearly supports and demonstrates that their VIGIV product is FDA appr oved, has an existing approved manufacturing facility, as well as the capability to maintain their manufacturing facility and FDA license so the DoD will have a continuous stockpile of licensed VIGIV.  This information MUST be emailed to leo.fratis@amedd.a rmy.mil or faxed to his attention at (301)619-7421 by no later than 4:00 p.m. on 27 March 2007.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Department is moving in the direction of using frequent, local, disk-based snapshots for quick recovery of lost or damaged files or e-mails, which will reduce the need for off-site transport of backups for disaster recovery purposes (as required in 12 FAM 622.3).  The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose is over $1700 per drive, and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare, at a cost of nearly $7,000 plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier (around $300) and a removable drive (also roughly $300 for the same capacity as tapes).  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>CHECKING THIS BOX CERTIFIES THAT SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND IS BIDDING PER ALL SPECIFICATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED IN ATTACHED DOCUMENT (1019731874Instructions.doc).

D) Full Dell warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1) It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2) It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5) The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>AMENDED TO CHANGE THE RESPONSE DATE TO 02/26/07<BR><BR>

<DESC>As of 1 March, 2007 the status of the CFT source slection is  unchanged.  OSD/DPAP is still waiting for all services to submit their business cases to justify use of CFT.  This request was issued in early Jan 2007 and a deadline for reply was established as 31 Jan 2007.  This deadline has not been met by all services.  Until these taskings have been accomplished, the source selection is on hold.  In the meantime it has become necessary to process extensions to the current basic contracts to accomodate the many delays we have encountered.  This paperwork is in process right now and an announcement of how long the contracts will be extended will be made as soon as possible.  We are hoping to have final approval to issue a formal RFP by 31 March 2007, but we cannot guarantee that.  We will post any futher news when it becomes available.  Thank everyone for their continued patience with this process.

<DESC>This is a modified synopsis.  The original synopsis stated that the proposed contract is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns. Offers from concerns other than SBs will not be considered. All responsible SBs submitting a proposal will be considered by NSWCCD. Due to a lack of proposals from small business concerns on the previous two contracts (N65540-05-M-0312 and N65540-06-M5202) the proposed contract is now unrestricted and open to full and open competition.  This change has been made because there is no reasonable expectation that two or more small businesses will submit proposals for this proposed contract.   This synopsis modification was previously submitted under the incorrect solicitation number (N65540-07-R-006).  The correct solicitation number for this synopsis is N65540-07-R-0006.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1) It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2) It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5) The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide comprehensive training and instructional services on a revised process for State and Federal personnel (surveyors) who inspect/survey the Nations' nursing homes.  Although all small businesses are encouraged to respond, CMS wishes to assess the possibility of a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or HubZone Small Business Set-Aside.

As part of its ongoing efforts to improve the nursing home survey process to achieve greater accuracy and consistency, CMS undertook developing an improved standard survey process.  After a six-year developmental effort, improvements to the survey process are now incorporated into a fundamentally different survey named the Quality Indicator Survey (QIS).  The new QIS process includes the use of portable tablet computers with custom designed software to complete some of the tasks of the survey.  The CMS expects to implement QIS nationwide beginning with a few selected States in the fall of 2007. 

The government seeks to identify any businesses that are currently capable of providing the following scope of services: 

1.	Conducting classroom training of State surveyors and field training of State surveyors on the new QIS process for nursing home inspections.
2.	Conducting training of a State?s trainers on the new QIS process for nursing home inspections.  
3.	Conducting an evaluation of the participants trained as surveyors and those participants trained as trainers to assess competency with the new process for nursing home surveys.

To conduct training and determine competency of participants trained on the QIS process, and those trained as CMS certified QIS State trainers, the contractor sought must: 

1.	Demonstrate current experience and knowledge of the new QIS process, including the ability to organize and implement a State agency QIS training program;  
2.	Demonstrate experience and/or ability to conduct classroom training and supervise QIS surveyors and these experiences include related activities of team leading, training new QIS surveyors on site, and/or supervising QIS teams including review of survey team compliance;  
3.	Demonstrate experience, knowledge and/or ability to conduct ?mock? training surveys with participants in the QIS training and assessments of participant compliance with the QIS process.
4.	Demonstrate experience of working directly with State agencies on QIS implementation and demonstrate knowledge of the ability to respond to substantive questions from State survey teams related to all aspects of the QIS; and

The prevailing NAICS code is 611430.  

Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to Dave Barbato at david.barbato@cms.hhs.gov.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE.  Please address each in order listed above.

Capability statements shall also include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, DUNS Number, and business size and status,(e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business) including any letters, certificates, or similar documentation indicating such status; corporate structure (corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, professional corporation, etc.); and tax identification number. Capability Statements shall be limited to 5-10 pages and shall include any/all teaming arrangements. 

All teaming arrangements shall also include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged. 

Responses must be submitted not later than COB on March 12, 2007. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates CMS to award a contract.  The sole intent is to obtain capabilities for set-aside and procurement planning purposes.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), is conducting a market survey to gather information from industry on Digital Asset Management Systems (DAMS) for multimedia news production. The results of the market survey will be used to help establish a future BBG requirement for DAMS. The BBG is responsible for United States Government (USG) non-military International Broadcast Services the Voice of America (VOA), the primary user of DAMS. It is anticipated that VOA produces more than 1,000 hours weekly of TV, Radio and Internet broadcasts in 44 languages. VOA currently has no enterprise Digital Asset Management system. VOA?s  Video, Audio, Storyline Scripting, Graphics and Web content creation systems are separate systems with limited integration and archiving capabilities. This market survey is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes, and is not considered a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for the information or inquiry.  The Government may limit follow-on procurement actions to interested sources that provide responsive submissions to this notice. This market survey is seeking information on commercial capabilities that can be applied as open architectural solutions to meet Digital Asset Management System needs or opportunities specific to News organizations. These needs and opportunities include but are not limited to: A) Search functions to identify and locate Audio/Visual content. B) Shared views and access to media across organization mediated by access control. C)Media life cycle management, from ingest to archiving.  
Solutions must be off-the-shelf and already proven in the broadcast arena. Interested sources shall submit a written ?Capabilities Statement? that provides, at the minimum the following: (1) PAST PERFORMANCE:  Evidence of specific examples of contractors successful past performance. (2)  TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: Interested parties shall provide information about their digital asset management system (DAMS) solutions that will integrate and leverage Voice of America?s (VOA) current Radio, Television and Internet news production systems.  These systems include Dalet, AVID, Finalcut, Newsflow, Anystream, INews, Pathfire and CommonSpot.  VOA is interested in a DAM solution that will improve enterprise multimedia file sharing, searching, and storage for its 15 news bureaus and 3000+ workforce.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to assist the National Institute of Standards and technology (NIST) in completing market research for a procurement that will soon be conducted for which the scope will be retention Index Data for the NIST Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) of the Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD). 

BACKGROUND OF PROPOSED ACQUISITION

Mass spectral data of some very important compounds (newly discovered pesticides, drugs, and natural products) as well as newly introduced analytical derivatives of common compounds are underrepresented in the Database.
The underrepresented classes of compounds specifically include derivatives used in analytical mass spectrometry (such as trimethylsilyl-, (t-butyl)dimethylsilyl-, dansyl-, acyl-, perfluoroacyl-derivatives, and alkyl- cycloalkyl esters) of important compounds (such as naturally occurring compounds, and commercially available compounds: amino-acids, hydoxy-acids, keto-acids, pesticides, known drug metabolites, food contaminants, chemical weapons related compounds, commercially available compounds, and compounds commonly present in the environment). In addition numerous spectra in the current Database have been recognized to be in need of reexamination. These spectra should be evaluated in accordance with the guidelines established by NIST in the document ?The critical evaluation of a comprehensive mass spectral library?, published in the Journal American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 1999, vol. 10, p, 287-299.


DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE OF SERVICES TO BE ACQUIRED

Task 1: The contractor shall measure mass spectra of compounds underrepresented in the Database . 

Task 2: The contractor shall perform accurate evaluation of the quality of mass spectral data using the structure of the compound, and comparing the data to the known good quality MS/MS spectra of similar compounds. This evaluation should involve determining that the spectrum with a given structure is logical (as defined in the document: ?The critical evaluation of a comprehensive mass spectral library?, published in the Journal American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 1999, vol. 10, p, 287-299) by using probable losses from the molecular ion, and well established rearrangements of ions in the gas phase.

Task 3: NIST anticipates that the contractor will from time to time meet with personnel at NIST to discuss error trends in the data (in Task 2) as well as to clarify problems that may be better addressed in a collegial setting. 



HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

Sources that currently possess capability to perform the aforementioned research are encouraged to respond to this notice and provide the following information:

1. Detailed narrative describing the company/organization?s current capabilities that are directly relevant to the aforementioned type of requirements;

2. Description of each similar project completed by your company/organization has completed as a prime Contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past three (3) years, including as much of the following information as possible: (a) dollar amount of the contract; (b) brief description of the technical requirements of that project; (c) contract type used on that project (e.g., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour, time-and-materials, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, etc.); (d) indication of how long the project took to complete from start to finish; and (e) name, address, point of contact and phone number of customer organization for which the work was done;

3. Current socioeconomic status of your company as it relates to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 541710, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, for which the size standard is 500.

4. Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov.

All responses to this notice shall be submitted by email only to sherri.miller@nist.gov no later than Monday, March 12, 2007.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on behalf of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) is conducting market research to determine the availability of a contractor to arrange and execute travel grants for IAF grantees and other grassroots development leaders to attend program-related workshops, conferences, meetings, and training events. 

The IAF is an independent agency of the United States government, established as part of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969. The mission of the IAF is to promote sustainable grassroots development throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. To that end, the IAF provides cash grants directly to grassroots and community based organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean to help them implement their own creative ideas for development and poverty reduction.

The IAF defines "grassroots development" as the process by which disadvantaged people organize themselves to improve the social, cultural, and economic well being of their families, communities, and societies. This concept is based on the premise that the key to sustainable democracies, equitable societies, and prosperous economies is a people oriented strategy that stresses participation, organization, development, and networking to build the social capital needed to complement human and physical assets. As a pioneer in grassroots development, the IAF seeks to support projects that produce real improvements on a local level, but that also have the potential to offer lessons and inspiration to others. 

As part of its efforts to support grassroots development in Latin America, the IAF often provides travel grants for individuals to participate in activities to share experiences and information with foreign counterparts. 

The Contractor shall expeditiously process travel grants issued by the IAF grantees including:

1. Make airline, hotel, and related reservations in accordance with U.S. Government guidelines. 

2. Provide pre-paid tickets in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations.

3. Review travel vouchers to ensure compliance with U.S. Government regulations before making final payments for costs incurred on trips. 

4. In most cases, pay directly for airfare, hotel and conference organizers and issue individual checks and/or process electronic funds transfers for meals and miscellaneous expenses. However, at the request of the IAF, the Contractor may be asked to provide individual checks and/or process electronic funds transfers to cover all travel expenses to allow the grantee to make their own arrangements. 

5. The Contractor shall be available to answer questions and resolve problems that arise during the planning and duration of the trips. 

6. Provide logistical support for IAF-sponsored training and dissemination events. 

7. Invoice promptly. 

Please provide BPD with the following information:

1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Small Business, Large Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or HubZone) based on NAICS Code 561599, size standard $6.5m.

2. Provide information that clearly indicates your capability to meet the above requirements. 

3. The name and contact information for customers, current or previous, for which you have provided services similar to the ones that we require. 

Also, please include whether your services are available through a GSA Schedule. Please include the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.

 All responses should be submitted electronically to: PSB3@bpd.treas.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. EST on March 8, 2007. The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered: .bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta,.cpl, and .zip files.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, in support of the Product Manager, Mortar Systems, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for  fabrication and delivery of lightweight bipod assemblies for the M224 60mm and  the M252 81mm Mortar Systems. The 60mm and 81mm mortar lightweight bipod  assemblies are to be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged, and shipped in accordance with Government TDPs and applicable contract requirements. This notice is a Sources Sought / Market Survey Announcement; a solicitation  is NOT available at this time. This Sources Sought / Market Survey is being used to seek sources capable of  manufacturing, assembling, inspecting, packaging, and shipping 60mm and 81mm  mortar lightweight bipod assemblies. Prior to manufacture, a producibility  study of the bipod designs will be conducted to obtain recommendations for  manufacturing and cost efficiencies, and technical improvements.   Recommendations  require Government approval prior to implementation.  The 60mm and 81mm lightweight bipod assemblies to be produced consist of light weight materials to reduce the carry weight of the currently fielded 60mm and  81mm Mortar Systems. Manufacture of the light weight bipod assemblies meeting the required physical and mechanical properties for the design will require  capability to fabricate struts, gears, springs and various other piece parts from high strength aluminum, titanium, inconel, and plastic. Potential  Offerors must possess experience in fabricating, machining, welding, and  inspecting titanium components and they must possess experience in machining  and inspecting gears. Potential Offerors must also have prior experience with  designs of similar complexity.	 The Basic contract calls for production of about eight hundred (800) 81mm  mortar lightweight bipod assemblies. The first option, if fully exercised will  be for production of one thousand (1000) 60mm mortar lightweight bipod  assemblies and more than five hundred (500) 81mm mortar lightweight bipod  assemblies. Monthly production deliveries will be for up to two hundred (200)  total bipod assemblies consisting of both 81mm and 60mm lightweight bipods.   First delivery will be one hundred twenty (120) days after U.S. Government  approval of the First Article.  Outyear options to procure additional 60mm and  81mm bipod assemblies are very likely. The anticipated contract will require the successful completion of a First  Article inspection. After successful completion of all First Article  requirements, lot acceptance will be invoked in accordance with applicable  Quality Assurance Provisions (QAP), drawings, and contract requirements.  Proof  Acceptance Testing (PAT) will be used to accept production run pieces  per the sampling plan included in the PAT test plan. The First Article samples  will be required to be submitted to the Government 7 to 9 months after  contract award.  Interested Offerors should provide, at no cost to the Government, a summary of  their firmâ€™s past experience, capabilities, size of business (small or large  business), description of facilities, personnel, equipment, tooling, quality  control of material and processes, packaging, storage facilities,  subcontractors and major vendors, and any other information and areas of  expertise that will demonstrate to the Government that they will be able to  achieve the effort described herein. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government;  information provided will not be returned.  All responsible, interested  Offerors are encouraged to submit their capabilities / qualification data and  any pertinent information via email, or electronically, No LATER THAN 15 March  2007.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept  written questions by email.

<CONTACT>Teresa L. Lukavec, (703) 325-9482
<DESC>Request for Information: The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) of 1986   requires the states and territories to allow certain citizens to register and vote in elections for federal office using absentee voting procedures and provides the authority for th e administration of federal voting assistance responsibilities.  The Secretary of Defense is the presidential designee for administration of the federal functions of the Act. The Director, Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) carries out the program on  behalf of the Secretary. The FVAP has three distinct goals  to inform and educate US citizens worldwide of their right to vote; to foster voting participation; and to protect the integrity of, and simultaneously enhance, the electoral process at the fede ral, state and local levels. UOCAVA covers the voting rights of: "	Absent uniformed services members and their voting age dependents "	Other U.S. citizens residing outside the United States.   The Act covers more than 6 million citizens, including approximately 3.7 million overseas citizens not affiliated with the government, 1.4 million military service members, 1.3 million military dependents, and 100,000 federal employees overseas.  Managemen t of the program requires coordination with Executive Branch departments and agencies, the Congress, state and local governments, political parties, U.S. corporations, and national and international organizations.  The FVAP is investigating potential concepts to support timely, secure, non-poll-site solutions for three separate voting tasks for this absentee voting population:  electronic Voter Registration, electronic Ballot Request, and electronic Blank Ballot Deli very. These tasks will be initiated by voters around the world from personal computers to communicate with local election offices anywhere in the United States and its territories.   Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot Requests utilize the Federal Post Card Application that is accepted by all 55 states and territories. Absentee voter registration and ballot request requirements vary by state. Accepted methods of transmittal of ballo ting material also vary.  Commensurate with this concept call, this RFI requests an assessment of the feasibility, technical maturity and growth potential of the enabling technologies.  Please submit your assessment to Ms. Sandy Ross at:  Sandra.Ross@BTA.mil not later than close of  business 30 March 2007.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  Do no t provide any costing data with your submission. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for any future contemplated effort.

This is only a Request for Information (RFI).     The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) plans to issue a RFP in FY2007/FY2008 for the procurement of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) Flight Operations Team (FOT) services. The FOT will operate the LDCM Observatory from the LDCM Mission Operations Center (MOC) located at the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and at a geographically separate Back-up MOC (bMOC) Facility (location TBD) for contingency operations.  The primary responsibilities of the FOT will include LDCM Observatory command and control, mission planning and scheduling, trending and analysis, flight dynamics support (including analysis, planning product generation, maneuver planning and execution), health and safety monitoring functions, on-board storage management, flight software management, mission and flight simulation, and anomaly response.  Prior to LDCM launch and subsequent mission operations, the FOT will have an integral role in Observatory (bus and instrument) and ground systems integration and test; in addition, launch preparation and readiness activities.  In preparation for procurement of the FOT, the USGS seeks lessons learned and other relevant experience in satellite operations that will aid in conducting an effective FOT acquisition.  The USGS solicits all relevant information, but the following sections list topics of specific interest.  PRE-LAUNCH During the pre-launch phase, the FOT will support Spacecraft Bus I&T and Instrument I&T, Observatory I&T, Ground Systems I&T, and launch readiness activities.  These activities will take place concurrently at a variety of government and contractor facilities. 1.	The USGS seeks recommendations for how the FOT may be used effectively during the pre-launch activities.  Responses should identify specific pre-launch activities, the role of the FOT in those activities,  required skills, risks (e.g., integrating FOT personnel with a contractor team), mitigation strategies, feedback and past experiences with integration of FOT members into the spacecraft, instrument, and observatory I&T process, including on-site involvement of key flight operations sub-systems and instrument engineers in I&T procedure development and test execution, and any other information that might be relevant to crafting the most effective approach for FOT pre-launch support. 2.	Training will be provided to the FOT during the pre-launch period.  The USGS seeks recommendations on effective training for flight operations.  Responses could include training content, approaches (e.g., classroom vs. hands-on, use of simulators, etc.), syllabi, schedules, etc.  The USGS is also interested in approaches to capturing and maintaining this initial FOT training for use in training future FOT staff. FLIGHT OPERATIONS Post-launch, the FOT will operate the LDCM Observatory from the LDCM MOC at the USGS Center for EROS located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, using a suite of ground hardware and software that will be procured in parallel or after the FOT procurement. 1.	The USGS seeks innovative FOT staffing approaches that provide benefits and/or reduced cost and risk.  Candidate approaches should include key assumptions, recruitment and retention strategies, position descriptions, a candidate staffing profile, and any further information needed to evaluate the approach.  Approaches may be contrasted or compared with relevant current satellite operations as appropriate. 2.	As noted above, the LDCM MOC will be located in Sioux Falls, SD and represents the first MOC to be established at the EROS facility and in the Sioux Falls area.  The USGS seeks lessons-learned and approaches on staffing the MOC at this facility.  Responses should include ability to effectively address on-orbit anomalies, attract and retain needed expertise, and methods of addressing attrition/turnover. PROCUREMENT The following topics concern the FOT acquisition approach. 1.	For the LDCM FOT, the USGS is considering a performance-based acquisition (FAR 37.6).  USGS seeks suggestions of appropriate performance measures, metrics and performance thresholds for a FOT, as well as any lessons-learned on the use of performance-based contracts in a satellite operations environment. Information responding to this request should be received within 21 calendar days from publication of this notice.   Concise responses are encouraged and appreciated; it is not necessary to respond to all parts of this RFI.  Organizations interested in providing responses or additional information in person are requested to schedule a briefing/meeting at the USGS Center for EROS.

<SUBJECT>74 -- American Embassy Kinshasa Standardization of Copiers
<DESC>The American Embassy Kinshasa located in the Democratic Republic of Congo in equatorial Africa intends to standardize on Kyocera Mita copiers in support of post operations.  The goal is to implement and apply commonality, standardization, and interoperability amongst all copiers at post.  In addition, standardization reduces maintenance and overhead costs.  The Government believes that only one responsible manufacturer can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the Agency Standardization Program requirements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

Environmental conditions and power fluctuations create a continuing need to repair and/or replace copiers that become unserviceable or uneconomical to maintain or operate.  Replacing electronic components in a timely manner is difficult as local companies do not consistently and reliably stock replacement parts from other manufacturers.

Standardization provides a cost effective solution and reduces maintenance and overhead costs by reducing excessive and unnecessary costs that are involved in stocking parts, tools and equipment necessary to service various copiers from multiple manufacturers.  Keeping an adequate inventory of spare parts for numerous manufacturers is very difficult and expensive.  Cannibalization and interchangeability of parts of the same manufacturer minimizes disruption to post operations.

This announcement is for informational purposes only; it is not a request for proposals or quotations.  Interested firms may send capability statements to the attention of Ms. Jan Visintainer at the email address listed below.  Capability statements must be received by March 9, 2007.  A determination by the Government to standardize this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>D--Notice of intent to award sole source.
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Revenue Center, Topeka, KS intends to award a sole source contract for Telecom Training Services to Technology for Business (TFB) of Manhattan Beach California. The Government intends to award this contract IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1).  The DVA HRC presently operates several  nationwide call centers with the primary mission to provide various support services to current and former veterans and their spouses.  The DVA  made award in September of 2005 to SDV Telecommunications of Grass Valley, California  under competitive proposals received in response to the RFP for replacement of the existing PBX system and associated upgrades.  TFB was a lower tier subcontractor responsible for the IVR under this contract. This action has been determined to be out of scope of the original contract.  Technology for Business (TFB) implemented the VA HRC IVR as part of the implementation of the new telephony system at the Health Revenue Center (HRC) in Topeka, Kansas.  The IVR system includes transcription and callback functionality as well as interfaces with existing HRC databases and VA web services.  The VA HRC believes TFB to be the only source that can provide custom training to the HRC on functionality provided in the system, specific to the HRC’s system, which will also provide the HRC with a copy of all the specially developed “special treatments” coding.  TFB is the manufacturer (OEM) of the TFB IVR product in production at the HRC.  Training will cover CTI server hardware/software, media server training, custom IVR development training (using and including the API toolkit from TFB), and Contact Director. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination to conduct a competitive procurement will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Phone inquiries will not be accepted. Responses related to this notice shall be in writing and must be received no later than March 12, 2007. POC Barry Fetzer, DVA HRC, 3401 SW 21, Bldg 9, Topeka, KS 66604.  The value of this acquisition is below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  This is a simplified acquisition.*****

FAR CLAUSES:  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb 2007): 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (Nov 2006) - 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (Apr 2002); 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Sept 2006); 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (Jun 1998);  52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (Sept 2006); 52.222-39, Notification of Employee Rights Concerning Payment of Union Dues or Fees (Dec 2004); 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003); 52.216-18 Ordering (Oct 1995); 52.216-19 Order Limitations (Oct 1995).    

BASIS FOR AWARD:  This procurement is being solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  The OCC will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible hotel (FAR Subpart 9.104) whose quote will be the most advantageous to the OCC using the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  

1.	Suitability encompasses the factors that contribute to the overall success of the conference and to the conference attendee's convenience, comfort and safety at the hotel.  Evaluation of suitability will be a subjective assessment of the features and services offered by the hotel and of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  The suitability assessment will focus on, but not be limited to, the location of the hotel, the condition of the hotel facility (new, old, remodeled); condition of the guest rooms (designated non-smoking rooms; soft goods clean and in good condition, etc.); condition of the meeting rooms (size and shape, obstructions such as pillars, soundproofing, security, proximity of rooms to each other, etc.); hotel services; availability of on-premise outlets, such as restaurants, convenience store and fitness facility; availability of transportation between the hotel and the airport;  characteristics of the neighborhood in which the hotel is located.  

 	The OCC may base its rating solely on the information provided in the quote or, at OCC's option, also on the findings gathered during a SITE VISIT.  

2.	Past performance is considered to be the hotel?s relevant work history and the OCC's assessment, with respect to such work history, of how well the hotel performed.  Especially relevant are a hotel's record of conforming to contract requirements; a hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction; and, generally, a hotel's reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on OCC's experience, if any, with the hotel; the experience of references submitted by the hotel; and a consideration of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.   

3.	Price.  Price is the total evaluated cost of a quote.  OCC will base total evaluated cost on the prices quoted for guest rooms, meeting rooms, food and beverages, and audio visual equipment.  OCC will not consider prices that are contingent, unreasonable or unbalanced.  OCC will use total evaluated cost as part of its best value analysis.

OCC anticipates awarding the contract in April 2007.

The suitability assessment will focus on, but not be limited to, the location of the hotel, the condition of the hotel facility (new, old, remodeled); condition of the guest rooms (designated non-smoking rooms; soft goods clean and in good condition, etc.); condition of the meeting rooms (size and shape, obstructions such as pillars, soundproofing, security, proximity of rooms to each other, etc.); hotel services; availability of on-premise outlets, such as restaurants, convenience store and fitness facility; proximity of the Metro to the hotel.  The OCC may base its rating solely on the information provided in the quote or, at OCC's option, also on the findings gathered during a SITE VISIT.  

2.  Past performance is considered to be the hotel's relevant work history and the OCC's assessment, with respect to such work history, of how well the hotel performed.  Especially relevant are a hotel's record of conforming to contract requirements; a hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction; and, generally, a hotel's reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on OCC's experience, if any, with the hotel; the experience of references submitted by the hotel; and a consideration of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.   

3.  Price.  Price is the total evaluated cost of a quote.  OCC will base total evaluated cost on the prices quoted for guest rooms, meeting rooms, food and beverages, and audio visual equipment.  OCC will not consider prices that are contingent, unreasonable or unbalanced.  OCC will use total evaluated cost as part of its best value analysis.

OCC anticipates awarding the contract in late March 2007.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests quotations and constitutes the only solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the Government-Wide Point of Entry, www.fedbizopps.gov. Request for Quotation number EDOFSA-07-000232 shall be referenced on any quotation.

This solicitation is being issued under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Small Business Set-Aside.  The NAICS code is 541618 with a small business size of $6.5 million.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This contract action will result in multiple Firm Fixed Price Purchase Orders. 
The Department of Education, Federal Student Aid, is seeking qualified psychometricians to determine whether certain tests developed by test publishers meet basic test standards. The tests to be reviewed will be used to determine federal student aid eligibility for a student who does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent.  By law, such a student may still be eligible for a grant or loan if he or she can demonstrate the "ability to benefit" from the training offered by a postsecondary institution.

The Department will select experts in the field of education testing and assessment, who possess appropriate advanced degrees and experience in test development or psychometric research, to determine whether a test meets the requirements for test approval.  We are required to hire psychometricians to review tests to ensure the tests meet the standards delineated in the regulations--34 CFR 668, Subpart J.  The Statement of Work at the end of this notice has further information on the standards.

No travel would be required.  Two psychometricians will review each test separately.  The two psychometricians will then confer (via telephone, email, etc.) and submit a joint list of comments and questions to the Department of Education representative (through email).  The Department of Education representative will forward this list to the test publisher for their consideration and comments, and then return the publisher's response back to both psychometricians to work through any remaining issues.  Once all issues have been resolved, the final deliverable is a statement from the psychometricians indicating either the approval or disapproval of the test.  If disapproved, the psychometricians would need to provide a detailed explanation for recommending denial, along with the specific steps the publisher would need to take in order to obtain approval.

The tests the Department of Education needs to have reviewed average about 200 pages of test materials and supporting documentation.  In the past, the average time for the work involved has been about 18 hours per test.  The tests requiring review have been approved before - they are not new tests.  But in accordance with the regulations, every five years, they must be renewed through another review process.  The tests must be normed with a contemporary population representative of persons who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the United States.  The current approval for these tests will not expire until this review process is completed.

The Government intends to issue multiple orders for the above services to the responsible vendors whose quotes conform to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical (qualifications, knowledge, degrees/expertise), (2) past performance (test review experience), and (3) price.  Technical and past performance combined are more important than price, but as technical and past performance evaluations converge price becomes more important.  The contracting officer will determine if any difference in technical/past performance warrants a difference in price. 

The evaluation will be based on information provided by the vendor in his/her quote, which shall include pricing information.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the quotation, but may do so at its discretion.   

Quoters shall submit at least two references for evaluation of past performance of same or similar services, which have been successfully completed by the quoter within the past two (2) years.

Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation.  The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:  

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Sept 2006); 
FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)- Award will be made to the responsible offerors whose offers are considered to be most advantageous to the Government using the evaluation factors as referenced above.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions; 
FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (Nov 2006) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; 
FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb 2007); 
FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Nov 2006) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply:  FAR 52.219-6 and 52.232-33.

Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at http://www.arnet.gov. All quotes from responsible sources will be considered. 

Quotes will only be accepted electronically and are to be submitted to Deborah.Wrabley@ed.gov.  No other method of submission will be accepted.  The deadline for quotes is Monday, March 12, 2007 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Quotes shall include pricing per test review.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The U.S Department of Education is seeking qualified psychometricians to determine whether certain tests developed by test publishers meet basic test standards.  The tests to be reviewed will be used to determine federal student aid eligibility for a student who does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent.  By law, such a student may still be eligible for a grant or loan if he or she can demonstrate the "ability to benefit" from the training offered by a postsecondary institution.  

The Department will select experts in the field of education testing and assessment, who possess appropriate advanced degrees and experience in test development or psychometric research, to determine whether the test meets the requirements for test approval.

A.  In reviewing the tests, experts selected by the Department will review the applications submitted by test publishers to ensure the tests --

1.  Assess secondary school level basic verbal and quantitative 
skills and general learned abilities;

2.  Sample the major content domains of secondary school level 
verbal and quantitative skills with sufficient numbers of questions to adequately represent each domain; and permit meaningful analyses of item-level performance by students who are representative of the contemporary population beyond the age of compulsory school attendance and have earned a high school diploma;

3.  Require appropriate test-taking time to permit adequate sampling of the major content domains;

4.  Have all forms (including short forms) comparable in reliability;

5.  If the test is revised, have new scales, scale values, and scores that are demonstrably comparable to the old scales, scale values, and scores;

6.  Meet all primary and applicable conditional and secondary standards for test construction provided in the 1985 edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, with amendments dated June 2, 1989, prepared by a joint committee of the American Educational Research Association, the American Psychological Association, and the National Council on Measurement.

7.  Have publisher's guidelines for retesting, including time between test-taking, be based on empirical analyses that are part of the studies of test reliability.

B.  Before recommending approval test experts must verify the publisher's application:

1.  Includes a test booklet or package with clear, specific, and complete instructions for test administration, as well as information for test takers on the purpose, timing, and scoring of the test; and sample questions representative of the content and average difficulty of the test;

2.  Contains two or more secure, equated, alternate forms of the test;

3.  Provides tables of distributions of test scores which clearly indicate the mean score and standard deviation for high school graduates who have taken the test within three years prior to the date on that the test is submitted to the Secretary for approval;

4.  Displays the distribution of test scores for each edition, form, level, sub-test, or partial battery, for which approval is sought, to ensure the passing score is one deviation below the mean for students with high school diplomas who have taken the test within three years before the date on which the test is submitted to the Department of Education.  

5.  Norms the test with groups that were of sufficient size to produce defensible standard errors of the mean and were not disproportionately composed of any race or gender; and a contemporary population representative of persons who are beyond the usual age of compulsory school attendance in the United States; and

6.  If test batteries include sub-tests assessing different verbal and/or quantitative skills, a distribution of test scores as described in paragraph 3 that allows the Secretary to prescribe either a passing score for each sub-test; or one composite passing score for verbal skills and one composite passing score for quantitative skills.

C.  Test experts must also verify an application contains sufficient documentation to support the test publisher?s claims.  The test experts will verify and review:

1.Documentation of test development, including a history of the test's use;

2.  Norming data and other evidence used in determining the distribution of test scores;

3.  Material that defines the content domains addressed by the test;

4.  For tests first published five years or more before the date submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, documentation of periodic reviews of the content and specifications of the test to ensure that the test continues to reflect secondary school level verbal and quantitative skills;

5.  If a test has been revised from the most recent edition approved by the Secretary, an analysis of the revisions, including the reasons for the revisions, the implications of the revisions for the comparability of scores on the current test to scores on the previous test, and data from validity studies of the test undertaken subsequent to the revisions.

6.  A description of the manner in which test-taking time was determined in relation to the content representativeness requirements in paragraph A.1 above, and an analysis of the effects of time on performance;

7.  A technical manual that includes an explanation of the methodology and procedures for measuring the reliability of the test; evidence that different forms of the test, including, if applicable, short forms, are comparable in reliability; other evidence demonstrating that the test permits consistent 
assessment of individual skill and ability; documentation of the level of difficulty of the test; unambiguous scales and scale values so that standard errors of measurement can be used to determine statistically significant differences in performance; and additional guidance on the interpretation of scores resulting from any modifications of the tests for persons with documented disabilities.

8.  The technical manual must also include evidence that the test was normed using groups that were of sufficient size to produce defensible standard errors of the mean and were not disproportionately composed of any race or gender; and a contemporary population representative of persons who are beyond the usual age of compulsory school attendance in the United States;

9.  An analysis of the item-content of each edition, form, level, and (if applicable) sub-test to demonstrate compliance with the required secondary school level criterion.    

10.  The description of retesting procedures and the analysis upon which the criteria for retesting are based.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Kistler Instrument Corporation, 75 John Glenn Drive, Amherst, NY   14228-2171.  Kistler is the only known qualified source to perform this effort.  AFRL/MNME desires to purchase 36 ballistic high pressure transducers, (18 ea Ballistic High Pressure Transducers ? 617 C and 18 ea Ballistic High Pressure Transducers ? 217 C.)  These transducers will be used as part of an experiment with explosive systems.  The pressure regime can cover from 500 psi to 100,000 psi with a duration from .5 to 5 milliseconds.  The transducers that are presently used are piezoelectric crystalline quartz sensing elements with a high-impedence charge signal output.  The instruments require low-noise cable with very high insulation resistance.  A new test for penetrator survivability conducted at AFRL/MNME relies on key pieces of data derived from ballistic pressure.  

Market research indicates that Kistler is uniquely capable as Kistler ballistic pressure transducers have been used for years at AFRL/MNME.  Specifically the 617 C and the 217 C have proven to be very reliable in the range of pressure measurement that is needed (30 ksi to 90 ksi).  All of AFRL/MNME?S calibrations have been developed for this particular ballistic pressure transducer utilizing a Kistler calibrator. 

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties must submit a vendor quote within 15 days of publication to Air Force Research laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn:  Judie Jacobson, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Ste 337, Eglin AFB, FL   32542-6810.  Please refer technical questions to Joseph Glenn at (850) 882-8842 and contractual questions to Judie Jacobson at (850) 883-2678.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is the Center/MAJCOM Ombudsman, Ms. Amy Smith, Acting Director of Contracting, Tel:  (937) 904-9700 or by FAX (937) 255-5036.   Numbered Note 22.

Sole Source Justification
For Invicta 210 Receiver and Mounting Kits

Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.  As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:

(1).  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a ?Justification for other than full and open competition.?

USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN).

(2).  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

Purchase twenty-two (22) Raven Invicta DGPS receivers as kits part number 11172001032.  The kits include MBA-2 Antenna Pole Mount, Power, Date, and Antenna Cable, Reference and quick start manuals. 

(3).  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs
 (including the estimated value).

The Invicta 210 is a marine grade DGPS that has a 9-12 inch pass-to-pass accuracy that utilizes WAAS Differential and/or US Coast Guard signal.  This receiver includes a front panel display, a water proof enclosure, 10 Hz, 10 Channel GPS, WAAS, 9 inch pass to pass accuracy with WAAS, < 1 meter Accuracy, dual serial RS232 ports, front panel display and control, configurable via serial port from the ECPINS? software, and the added capability of providing the NMEA proprietary strings PMVXG 021 and PMVXG 830 messages in addition to all other standard NMEA sentences.  The RAVEN? Invicta 210 is the only DGPS that will allow the receiver to be configurable via the ECPINS software and also provide the additional proprietary NMEA strings.  The entire cost of the RAVEN? receivers are $48k.  
Use of a different DGPS receiver would cause added cost in ECPINS? software development and testing in addition to any research and development cost of to any DGPS companies to provide the needed PMVXG NMEA strings.  This would dramatically add cost and delays to the project with no significant savings or improvements for the Coast Guard.

(4)  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other that full and open competition.

6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
(a) Authority.
2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in? 
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or 
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).) 

 (5).  A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

Only one responsible source.  No other vender can meet the Coast Guard's legacy integration requirements. RAVEN? Invicta 210 is currently fielded, tested and is installed on 30 Coast Guard Cutters.

 (6).  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and , if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

Conducted Market research via the internet.  Other Receivers are available but none satisfy the Coast Guards legacy integration requirements. 

(7).  A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

Evaluated two additional sources of comparable items. These machines do not meet the Coast Guard needs but can be used to show fair and reasonable cost. 
 
(8).  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

Market research was completed and two comparables machines were evaluated but are not compatible with currently install equipment. 

(9).  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:

(i).  Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  

Not applicable.

(ii).  When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.

Buying a different DGPS receiver would quadruple the cost of the project and delay the field deployment by 1 year or more. 

(iii).  When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.

Same as above.

(10).  A listing of the sources , if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None.

(11).  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

Will reevaluate the hardware and software requirements at the end of it?s life cycle.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to offer responses to questions received.

07-56:  Interdisciplinary Research

Q1:  I see that this acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside (revenue ceiling $6.5 million annually).  My firm certainly meets that definition.  What documentation do I need to provide in order to demonstrate?

A2:  Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a contract.  Among other things your profile on CCR will indicate your small business status.  To register in CCR go to www.ccr.gov .

Q2:  Is there a standard outline that I should follow?

A2:  No

Q3:  When will the contract be awarded?

A3:  The award will be made at the conclusion of the review process, tentatively mid- April.
 
Q4:   The project objective indicates that the selected vendor is responsible for the development of an "implementation plan" but it appears that the vendor may also be required to develop some of the programs (specifically educational programs, the development of interdisciplinary biopsychosocial methods, and the development of performance measures) that will result from the implementation planning process.  Is the true scope of the project limited to planning (as opposed to actually implementing)?  

A4:  The vendor is expected to work with OBSSR in developing programs in this area.

Q5:  Should I indicate in my proposal specifics about who (or what institutions) should be involved in the collaborative planning process OR will these partners be identified to me by the Project Officer, OBSSR Director and Staff upon the beginning of the project?  

A5:  Please provide specifics about who should be involved.

Q6:  Is the description of SMART objectives provided in the solicitation to inform me of accepted nature of the performance measures that will be developed for the implementation of the OBSSR priorities OR to inform me of how I should define the objectives of this project (07-56SB)?

A6:  The former.

Q7:  Is the selected vendor expected to submit an Implementation Plan and Assessment Plan?

A7:  Not as part of the response.

Q8:  Is the report titled, "The Contributions of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research to Improving the Health of the Nation: A Prospectus for the Future", DRAFT REPORT, dated 6/20/2006 the document that the RFP refers to as the "Strategic Prospectus"?

A8:  That is correct.

Q9:  Also, is there any particular format for the electronic response?

A9:  No.

Q10:  What is the application format?

A10:  No pre-set format.

Q11:  What detail and/or forms are needed for the budget?                                                                       

A11:  Total amount needed to complete the task.

Q12:  What materials are included in the 10 page limit (ex: budget narrative, curricula vita, letters of support, etc.)?                                                                                                                                                                                 

A12:  Any materials deemed appropriate by the contractor to compete.

Q13:  What is required for statement(s) of credentials?  

A13:  That is up to the applicant.

Q14:  Are these programs related to the SBIR process?

A14:  No.

Q15:  The solicitation refers to FAR Part 13, simplified Acquisition procedures.  What is the threshold?

A15:  $100,000 total

Q16:  Will an e-mail submission of the final cost and technical proposal be accepted?

A16:  Yes.  The preferred submission is electronic.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to offer responses to questions received.

07/58: System Thinking Approaches

Q1:  Is the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research considering software acquisition to provide a more collaborative ways of information sharing?

A1:  No

Q2:  What is the application format?

A5:  That is up to the applicant.

Q6:  Are these programs related to the SBIR process?

A6:  No.

Q7:  Could you please let me know what type of budget justification is required in our proposal for Solicitation Number 07-058/SB?  
 
A7:  That is up to the applicant.

Q8:  What is the ideal amount of people that you would like to work on this project?

A8:  1 to 3

Q9:  My firm specializes in projects and services, involving very diverse health care networks and collaboratives, which relate to the scope of service for this solicitation. However, we concentrate on applied collaborative strategies more so than purely theoretical approaches or constructs. Is the overall intent of the solicitation geared more so to models for collaboration rather than actual "real world" strategies? 

A9:  Systems thinking approaches show promise for unlocking the secrets of complex, multi-dimensional health issues, and for transforming this knowledge into effective interventions that can fundamentally change population health.  OBSSR intends to harness systems thinking approaches to support very clear and specific objectives: 1) to better understand the complex biobehavioral bases of current population health issues; 2) to create a research culture that works to find and implement solutions to these health problems by understanding how to organize networks of stakeholders at multiple levels; 3) to develop more efficient systems that maximize existing resources; and 4) to effectively disseminate emergent knowledge.  This project involves the development of a strategic implementation plan to achieve these goals and objectives. 

Q10:  1. There are several references to having experience in evaluation and research studies, and use of databases - are the contractors expected to provide evaluation and research and database design in this contract, or are you looking for someone with such a background because you feel this background is necessary in order to understand the OBSSR strategic prospectus?  Can such experience be spread across several members of our team vs. one individual?

A10:  The implementation plan will have an evaluation component ? that is, we expect to develop performance metrics for each of the major projects for a future evaluation of the various programs that will be developed to implement the strategic prospectus.
 
Q11: Technical Evaluation Criteria - Item 2 -- What is meant by "specific experience with the content of the OBSSR's Strategic Prospectus of June 2006?"   

A11:  A contractor experienced with the content/subject matter covered in the strategic prospectus is highly desirable since this is a contract is to help develop an implementation plan for the strategic prospectus.  A behavioral and social science researcher preferably with a strong academic background is desirable.


Q12:  What is meant by experience...in computer database software and system operations?"

A12:  The strategic prospectus calls for specific projects to facilitate the development and application of conceptual frameworks and tools needed for the systematic study of health and its determinants, promote and support the development of biometrics, and the maintenance and widespread use of databases containing longitudinal genomic, biomarker, social, and behavioral data related to health, and also contribute to the development of analytical frameworks, methods, and algorithms capable of integrating, analyzing, and interpreting highly diverse data with varying metrics from research on genomic sequences, molecules, behavior, and social systems.  To assist implementing these initiatives, the contractor needs to have experience working with the development and integration of databases and their application to systems thinking approaches to population health research

Q13: Given the statement "specific experience with content of OBSSR's Strategic Prospectus, is there an incumbent already in mind?

A13:  This will be a competitive process ? but a contractor with experience with the content/subject matter covered in the strategic prospectus is highly desirable since this is a contract is to help develop an implementation plan for the strategic prospectus.  A behavioral and social science researcher preferably with a strong academic background is desirable.


Q14: Does the contractor have to have meeting facilities located near NIH/in Bethesda MD?

A14  :  No

Q15:  How often will it be necessary for the meetings to take place away from the NIH campus?

A15:  The meetings will seldom take place outside of the DC Metro Area ? however, some out of state meetings may be required.

Q16:  Is the intent to hire a local firm or may out of state firms(realistically) apply?

A16:  Out of state firms may apply.
