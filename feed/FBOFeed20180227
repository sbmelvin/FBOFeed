<p>The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) have existing ANSYS equipment. The only company that provides maintenance and support for its software is ANSYS Incorported. ANSYS does not authorize 3rd party vendors to resell or distribute this product. This decision was made by ANSYS so that software updates can be provided to their customers directly and so that technical support for installation and modeling can be provided.</p>
<p>The ANSYS software is needed to support ongoing finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics research projects for CDRH's Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL) and Division of Applied Mechanics (DAM). In order to obtain optimum functionality in the software, technical support and product enhancements are necessary.

Ansys Incorporated's Software Maintenance program, engineers in DAM will be able to obtain telephone and email support for operating these software packages. Engineers will also be able to obtain new releases of the software which will include updated algorithms, enhanced functionality, and corrections. Without this maintenance agreement, engineers in DAM would be operating out of date software with limited functionality.</p>

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong><br /><strong>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). </strong>
<p>The NINDS Contracts Management Section of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), intends to solicit by a request for quotation from <strong>PerkinElmer Inc.</strong> for award on or around March 31, 2018. The purpose of this purchase order will be to provide the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) with a maintenance service agreement for the PerkinElmer In Vivo Micro CT Scanner currently in use by the NIH Mouse Imaging Facility.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE and SET ASIDE STATUS<br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 811219 with a Size Standard of $20.5 Million.</p>
<p>This acquisition is NOT set aside for small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY </strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source provides that: For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, Contracting officers may solicit from one source IF the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name OR industrial mobilization).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p>The NIH Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) is a shared, intramural resource for preclinical animal imaging studies. The MIF provides the NIH intramural research community access to modern radiological imaging equipment optimized for rodents and other laboratory animals for noninvasive imaging studies. The MIF provides intellectual, technical and material support for NIH investigators, and resources include: magnetic resonance imaging, micro-computed tomography, high frequency ultrasound with photoacoustic imaging, bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging. The MIF is dedicated to providing state-of-the-art anatomical, functional and molecular medical imaging capabilities for animal models of human disease.<br /><br /><strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the NIH Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) with hardware and software maintenance support for its Perkin-Elmer Corporation Quantum GX in vivo Micro-CT Scanner. </strong>This equipment is used to acquire three- dimensional radiographic computed tomographic images of small animals for ongoing preclinical biomedical research studies.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OEM Certification Requirement:</span></strong><br /><strong>Service personnel must be certified by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), PerkinElmer, Inc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, PerkinElmer Inc. is the only vendor in the marketplace that can provide the maintenance services on the PerkinElmer CT scanner housed at NIH without unacceptable risk to voiding the warranty on the CT scanner.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR part 10, extensive market research was conducted to reach this determination. Specifically, a sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps referencing the above detailed requirements and no responses were received. Additionally, contacts with knowledgeable individuals both in industry and Government, as well as reviews of available product literature, revealed no other sources. Finally, a review of the GSA Advantage, Dynamic Small Business Search, and previous government acquisitions returned no results that meet all of the requirements. Therefore, only PerkinElmer Inc. is found to be capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>The intended source is:<br />PerkinElmer Health Sciences Inc<br />710 Bridgeport Ave<br />Shelton, CT 06484-4750 </strong></p>
<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</strong> However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  All responses must provide evidence that they can provide OEM-certified technicians to perform maintenance services on the PerkinElmer CT scanner.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by the closing date and time of this announcement and must reference the solicitation number, NIH-NINDS-NOI-18-4848618. Responses must be submitted electronically to Jason Williams, Contracting Officer, at willjas@mail.nih.gov.  U.S. Mail and Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Delivery Order under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) contract for tasks necessary to support the Maritime Targeting Capability (MTC), formally known as Synthetic Guidance, for the Operational Embedded Software (OES) Development needed to support an FY18 Maritime Targeting Capability (MTC) flight test. The task shall include delivery of an OES build suitable for use in flight test and subsequent fleet release, along with the associated documentation and simulation tools. For the purposes of this effort, NAVAIR intends to award the delivery order to Raytheon Missile Systems, P.O. Box 11337, Bldg 9022 M/S K1, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337 (Point of Contact for Small Businesses interested in subcontracting - Veronica Harper - (520) 663-8839). Since 1998, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer of the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk Missile. Raytheon solely possesses the data rights to the current hardware and software configuration technical data packages for the Block IV Tomahawk Missile. Raytheon possesses the accredited performance analysis tools, interfaces, and models and simulations, as well as manages the key missile performance requirements and verification documents for the Tomahawk Missile. Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV AUR missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only known source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs. The data associated with the Tomahawk missile is export controlled and is not available to foreign sources or representatives. Responsible parties may submit capability statements which shall be considered. This is not a request for proposals.

<SOLNBR>N6945018R0903

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE) has been tasked to develop, solicit, and award a Design-Build (DB) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for general construction type work to be performed in the North Florida/South Georgia area. 

A sources sought notice for this requirement was posted under solicitation N69450NFSMACC on August 14, 2017 requesting small business industry interest and capability statement.  Based on responses from the notice, it was determined that the requirement should be issued as a total small business set-aside.  The NAVFAC SE Small Business Office concurs with this determination.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued as a total small business set-aside.
  All responsible small businesses with the specialized experience and qualifications required by the solicitation may submit a proposal to be considered by the agency.  The NAICS code for this IDIQ MACC solicitation is 236220 with a size standard of $36,500,000.

This solicitation will result in the award of approximately (5) Design-Build IDIQ MACCs, unless a number more than five (5) is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  The total aggregate value for all contracts to be awarded from any resultant solicitation is $99,000,000 maximum over the base year and all four option periods combined. There is no yearly or per contractor limit except for the total five (5) year maximum.
 Task orders will be firm-fixed-priced, normally in the range of $4,000,000 to $20,000,000 per order. However, task orders under or over these amounts may be considered if deemed to be in the Governments best interest.

Construction projects to be performed will primarily consist of general building type projects (new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work) including but not limited to: 1) aviation and aircraft facilities; 2) marine facilities; 3) barracks and personnel housing facilities; 4) administrative facilities; 5) warehouses and supply facilities; 6) training facilities; 7) personnel support and service facilities; 8) security level facilities; and 9) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including but not limited to asbestos, lead paint, mold remediation, and PCBs).
 Projects may also require comprehensive interior design and incorporation of sustainable features.

Work will be performed within the North Florida/South Georgia Area to include but not limited to:  Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Blount Island Command, Naval Station Mayport, Orlando, Cape Canaveral, Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Naval Reserve Centers and areas in South Carolina managed by NAVFAC SE.  Work may be required in other locations in the area of responsibility of NAVFAC SE if deemed necessary and approved by the NAVFAC SE Chief of Contracting Office.

The source selection method to be used is a best value continuum process in a negotiated two-phase acquisition utilizing the trade-off approach.
 Formal two-phase source selection will be used to select the proposals that provide the best value to the Government from a technical and price standpoint. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.1 and 15.3, a trade-off approach to source selection will be used for this solicitation with respect to the initial award.

Offerors selected to proceed to Phase-Two will be required to submit a technical and price proposal for a seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit a technical and a price proposal will not be considered for an award. The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded an IDIQ MACC for a base year with four (4) option periods and the seed project task order.
 The remaining four (4) selected offerors will be awarded an IDIQ MACC for a base year and four (4) option periods with a minimum guarantee of $1,000.00 over the five (5) year period.

This will be an electronic solicitation, which can be downloaded from FedBizOpps at https://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised as a set aside for Small Business (FAR 52.219-6) concerns.  This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.

This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.
  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair within the NAICS code listed, primarily by design-build or secondarily by design-bid-build of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system projects at various government installations located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California.

Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: Boiler/Chiller plants; Digital Direct Controls or Energy Management Control System; HVAC equipment energy optimization; commissioning and retro commissioning; distribution systems including supply and return air systems, ventilation and exhaust systems, steam, glycol, medical gas, refrigerant, heating hot water and chilled water distribution, associated terminal devices, heat recovery equipment, heat exchangers, sound attenuation, insulation, and associated appurtenances; energy supply including oil, gas, steam, heating hot and chilled water distribution systems; other HVAC systems and equipment including special cooling and humidity control, dust and fume collectors, air purifiers, paint booth ventilation systems; and system testing and balancing.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the annual size standard is 15 million.
  The basic contract period will be for 24 months.  Each contract contains one (1) 36-month option for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and option, for all contracts combined is 200,000,000.  Task orders will range between 50,000 and 5,000,000.  Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.
  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two:  Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Technical Solution, and Factor 6 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted.
 THE SOLICITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about February 9, 2018.

A sources sought notice was posted on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement as a small business set-aside. The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) San Diego District Office and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a three year Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract for the T-700 Engine Components (401C GG Rotor, NSN: 2840-01-476-1840, P/N 6082T004G16; 401GG Rotor NSN: 2840-01-344-6057, P/N: 6055T26G10, 401C Compressor Rotor NSN: 2840-01-366-0377, P/N: 6900T93G02; 401 Compressor Rotor NSN: 2840-01-375-6469, P/N: 6900T78G05, in support of the H-60 and H-1 aircraft. This PBL contract will be awarded to General Electric (GE) (Cage Code: 99207) located in Lynn, MA in October 2018. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will stock, warehouse, repair, modify and/or replace, store and provide for shipment of Ready-for-Issue (RFI) condition assets within the negotiated contractor response times.
 The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor assumes responsibility for many management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support. GE will be required to meet established response times through component repair replacement, reliability oversight and inventory, configuration and obsolescence management. 

The maximum period of performance for this effort will not exceed three (3) years. Justification for Sole Source Acquisition: the statutory authority applicable to permit other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) with only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
 Absent interest/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with General Electric, CAGE Code 99207, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the components to be covered under this PBL contract. GE is the only source with the engineering expertise and technical data necessary to perform essential PBL tasks such as repair, resolution of obsolescence issues, sustainment of reliability, and management of configuration of Navys Critical Application Item components covered by the contemplated procurement. Further, only GE owns the necessary design, configuration, manufacturing, production, and process data required for reliability sustainment. In addition, only GE has access to the original design data/OEM intellectual property.
 

Despite being designated sole source, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Ismael Gaytan at Ismael.Gaytan@navy.mil.
The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items, GE 99207, will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. 
Subcontracting Opportunities: All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact General Electric.

The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted. Responses will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed. **</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is conducting market research on behalf of the US Army's Office of the Program Manager Electro-Optic Infrared Payloads (PdM EO/IR Payloads). PdM EO/IR Payloads is conducting a market survey with the intent to locate potential industry sources capable of providing the following for the Common Sensor Payload (CSP) (NSN 5855015645450, NSN 5855016415099): acquisition of spares, repairs, sustainment, engineering support, and software support.</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION: The CSP is a multi-sensor day/night imaging payload composed of a Turret Unit (TU) and an Electronics Unit (EU). The TU incorporates an Eye-safe Laser Rangefinder (ELRF), Laser Designator (LD), Laser Target Marker (LTM), and Laser Spot Tracker (LST). An Electro-Optic (EO) sensor within the TU provides Standard and High Definition color or monochrome imagery during daytime conditions and an Infrared (IR) sensor provides Standard and High Definition imagery during various environmental conditions, both day and night. Both TU and EU are flight qualified hardware for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) with potential for use on other aviation platforms.</p>
<p>2. REQUIRED CAPABILITIES: The Government requires CSP spare and repair parts, logistics and engineering services as described below. The intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to assess industry's availability to provide CSP products and support services that could be applied to meet this requirement. The Government envisions a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) solution for CSP.</p>
<p>3. SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS: CSP is utilized as an EO/IR/LD sensor that provides a robust, advanced state of the art sensor suite to collect critical information for all members of the air-ground maneuver team. The CSP is utilized on Gray Eagle platforms (Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB), Aerial Exploitation Battalion (AEB), and Army Special Operations Aviation Command (ARSOAC)) and provides near real time imagery for detection and classification of targets/threats in the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside of the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) for operational missions. Required support:</p>
<p>a) Sustainment support, including but not limited to procurement and provisioning of system spares and replacement parts, manuals, support equipment, and diagnostic tools. Support by providing qualified technicians to serve as Field Service Representatives (FSR) to diagnose and troubleshoot failures both CONUS and OCONUS, support depot maintenance, packaging and demilitarization, and provide training and reach-back technical support as needed.<br /><br />b) Repair, retrofit, and modification of fielded CSP hardware<br /><br />c) CONUS and OCONUS Engineering Support, including but not limited to technical reach-back support for CSP hardware and software/firmware (SW/FW) for the payload and components, as well as engineering design activities.<br /><br />d) CSP payload replacement and replenishment (up to approximately 40 systems)<br /><br />e) Technical insertion of a hardware and software enhancement which:</p>
<p>1. Makes CSP a Metric Sensor. The CSP would thereafter provide, in the metadata, the&nbsp;horizontal and vertical error associated with the coordinate position within the reticle overlay.<br /><br />2. Increases the operator's situational awareness and reduces their cognitive burden. The system will have all HD sensors with the addition of a Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) camera capable of imaging a laser designation spot. The system will have a day/night capable medium Field of View (FOV) so the operator can maintain an awareness over a larger area for target detection while simultaneously using the targeting camera to provide a target identification. Additionally, the CSP will have an Aided Target Recognition (AiTR) system which will automatically detect and cue the operator to potential targets.<br /><br />The planned acquisition is a ceiling increase and one-year Period of Performance extension to the current Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to maintain support for PdM EO/IR's fleet of CSP systems. The Government anticipates contract award in June 2018. The contract modification is to be a hybrid contract to include Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost (No Fee) for travel, material, and ODCs, and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) elements.<br /><br />Interested vendors are required to provide an approach on how to meet the above requirements and be able to demonstrate CSP requirements, capabilities, and qualification.

The Program Executive Office Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation's (PEO STRI's) Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE) Live Training Transformation (LT2) CPM Plus approach focuses on the requirements, development, execution, management, and synchronization of the LT2 Product-Line (P/L). The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. Based on responses to this Sources Sought Notice, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Disclaimer</span>: This Sources Sought is for informational purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) to be submitted. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary.<br /><strong><br />Background<br /></strong>In 2001, PEO STRI put the LT2 P/L strategy in place. Today, through the use of the current CPM Next contract, PM TRADE builds and maintains the LT2 P/L systems in support of home station training, deployed training, urban operations training, maneuver combat training centers training, and instrumented live-fire range training. The LT2 P/L provides state-of-the-art training systems to the warfighter using over 186 common reusable software components, service-oriented architecture services, architectural infrastructure, interfaces, standards, processes, and information technology assets.<br /><br />With 21 LT2 products fielded to over 200 sites globally, the LT2 P/L successfully employs technical and acquisition strategies that significantly reduce fielding time, minimize acquisition costs, enable total ownership cost reductions, and enhance training benefits afforded to the warfighter.<br /><strong><br />Requirement Description<br /></strong>The CPM Plus contract will continue to manage the evolution of the LT2 P/L and provide total life cycle support to those programs that utilize the LT2 P/L. The CPM Plus contract will continue to meet the requirements for a consolidated streamlined approach that:<br /><br />1) Protects and leverages the Army's LT2 P/L investment.<br /><br />2) Continues the development and evolution of the LT2 products/systems, core assets, architectural frameworks, and the LT2 P/L Construct.<br /><br />3) Continues to provide PM TRADE with efficient, effective, and agile methods to deliver military training products.<br /><br />CPM Plus is the contractual framework by which PM TRADE will execute control of a systems life cycle within a System-of-Systems (SoS) environment to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system, while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based. CPM Plus will continue to evolve the deliberate process for managing the development, production, and sustainment of LT2 products. CPM Plus will enable using organizations to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems, and SoS integration for which they are responsible throughout the total system life cycle.<br /><br />The anticipated nature and complexity of the LT2 P/L work tasks (ranging from P/L architectural development, system development, SoS management to P/L core asset variability, and configuration management) associated with CPM Plus requires mature and established processes, and therefore, at least a level 3 CMMI company rating.<br /><strong><br />Acquisition Strategy Planning Information<br /></strong>The following Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) are attached to this Sources Sought:<br /><br />1) CPM Plus Base Statement of Work<br />2) CPM Plus CTIA Statement of Work<br />3) CPM Plus LT2 Construct Statement of Work<br />4) CPM Plus CTC-IS PDSS Statement of Work<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Contract Vehicle</span>: Based upon the current LT2 P/L strategy approach executed under the current CPM Next contract, and successes garnered from that approach, (cost avoidances of over $800 million as one example since LT2 P/L inception) the anticipated contract methodology is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with delivery orders under the ID/IQ contract to accomplish the expected work. The CPM Next contract has had to date 22 delivery orders.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Contract Type</span>: Delivery order contract types under the CPM Plus overarching contract are anticipated to be consistent with the CPM Next contract - multiple types that provide flexibility and agility to the using program offices that want to garner the benefits of the LT2 processes in place for cost avoidance and conformance to Army live training standards.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Contract Ceiling</span>: The CPM Next contract is a five-year, single-award ID/IQ contract with a total ceiling of $415M. It is anticipated that the CPM Plus will be an eight-year, single-award ID/IQ contract with a total ceiling of approximately $800M.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />NAICS Code</span>: The following NAICS codes are currently under consideration for CPM Plus:<br /><br />- 333318, Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing<br />- 541511, Custom Computer Programming Service<br />- 541512, Computer Systems Design Services<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Acquisition Time Estimates</span>:<br />1) Sources Sought information request due by 13 March 2018<br />2) Industry Day TBA at PEO STRI in Orlando, FL, with industry one-on-one discussions with those interested in being prime contractors in conjunction with the Industry Day<br />3) Draft RFP release Government Fiscal Year 2019, 1st quarter (October - December<br />2018)<br />4) RFP release Government Fiscal Year 2019, 1st quarter (October - December 2018)<br />5) Proposals due 30 days after RFP release<br />6) Contract award - February 2020<br /><strong><br />Response Submission<br /></strong>Information Paper Instructions: As a part of Market Research, the Government requests interested contractors provide up to a 10 page summary, inclusive of cover page, that addresses the following topics within the context of the LT2 P/L domain.<br /><br />1) Intelligent Data Analytics<br />a.

Information for market research purposes only. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 2,
Network Contracting Office (NCO2) is currently conducting a market survey for firms capable of providing the following: 

Nitric Oxide inhalation Gas for VA New York Harbor Healthcare System. 


Introduction and Background
The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System is dedicated to providing quality health care to veterans using the abilities of all employees supported by our commitment to education and research.
We are recognized locally, regionally, and nationally as a leader in quality patient care, positive customer service, medical/allied health education, health-related research and employment opportunities. We seek to be the provider of choice of veterans and the community by offering an efficient, integrated quality health care system capable of providing a full range of primary, specialty and chronic health care services in a system that is readily accessible and responsive to change.
Respiratory Care Service provides a 24 hour 7 day coverage for inpatient Respiratory patients as well as multifaceted outpatient care. The care provided includes:
Home Oxygen evaluation and follow-up
Patient education on various respiratory equipment
Cpap/Bipap clinic
Sleep Clinic (unattended take home sleep studies, mask fitting, equipment setup and followup)
EEG testing
Pulmonary Function Testing
Pulmonary Rehabilitation
Role of Nitric Oxide in Respiratory Disease
Inhaled nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator that improves ventilation perfusion matching at low doses in patients with acute respiratory failure, potentially improving oxygenation and lowering pulmonary vascular resistance.
The anatomic target of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is the vascular smooth muscle cells that surround the small resistance arteries in the lungs. As NO diffuses through the alveolar membrane, it reaches these smooth muscle cells, causing an increase in the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate that in turn sets off a chain of events resulting in the reduction of smooth muscle tone. Inhaled NO therapy is used in adult respiratory distress syndrome and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate because it reduces pulmonary artery pressure and vasodilates the blood vessels in ventilated regions. This reduces the shunt fraction and simultaneously increases PaO2.. 
Ideal Treatment Goals for Inhaled Nitric Oxide
Improved oxygenation
Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance
Decreased pulmonary edema
Reduction or prevention of inflammation   rebound phenomena may be avoided by withdrawing inhaled nitric oxide gradually. Despite these concerns, in large clinical studies of patients with ARDS, the abrupt discontinuation of inhaled nitric oxide has not caused a deterioration in oxygenation
Cytoprotection
Protection against infection
Nitric oxide is most commonly administered to patients receiving mechanical ventilation, although it may also be given through a face mask or nasal cannulae. Limiting the mixing of nitric oxide and high concentrations of inspired oxygen reduces the risk of adverse effects resulting from the formation of nitrogen dioxide. This is minimized further by introducing the mixture of nitric oxide and nitrogen into the inspiratory limb of the ventilator tubing as near to the patient as possible and synchronizing injection of the mixture with inspiration.
Objective/Requirements
INOTHERAPY Pharmaceutical solutions INOMAX(nitric oxide) for inhalation
Delivery device meeting criteria for the administration of the nitric oxide and needed items, accessories and disposables
Support for maintenance/calibration requirements
Training and 24/7 technical support
The INOMAX Delivery System provides a constant dose of INOMAX into the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit. It uses a  dual-channel  design to ensure the safe delivery of INOMAX. The first channel has the delivery CPU, the flow controller and the injector module to ensure the accurate delivery of NO. The second channel is the monitoring system, which includes a separate monitor CPU, the gas sensors (NO, NO2, and O2 sensors) and the user interface, including the display and alarms. The dual-channel approach to delivery and monitoring permits INOMAX delivery independent of monitoring. This allows the monitoring system to shutdown INOMAX delivery, if it detects a fault in the delivery system. 

INOMAX drug is stored as a gas mixture of NO/N2 in an aluminum cylinder at a nominal pressure of 2000 psig.
The cylinder is attached to a high pressure regulator, which incorporates a pressure gauge that indicates cylinder pressure when the cylinder valve is open. The cylinder regulator is attached via tubing to the INOmax delivery system using one of the two NO/ N2 quick connect inlets on the back of the machine.
The INOmax DSIR checks the INOMAX cylinder for the correct expiration date and cylinder concentration.
The INOMAX enters the back of the INOmax DSIR, passes through a filter, then a safety shutoff valve, which is open under normal operation.
An injector module is placed in the ventilator gas flow between the ventilator inspiratory outlet and the humidifier. Based on the ventilator flow, the INOMAX cylinder concentration and set INOMAX dose, the proportional solenoid valve delivers 800 ppm INOMAX into the ventilator circuit via the injector module where it mixes with the breathing circuit gas flow to achieve the set dose. This allows the INOmax DSIR to deliver a constant dose of INOMAX regardless of the ventilator flow pattern or breath rate.
A flow sensor inside the INOmax DSIR also monitors the NO flow out of the machine. A check valve is included prior to the INOmax DSIR drug outlet to prevent pressure effects from the ventilator breathing circuit interfering with the NO flow sensor reading.
Gas Monitoring - The INOmax DSIR gas monitoring system provides monitored values for inspired NO, NO , and O . The sample gas is withdrawn from the breathing circuit and goes through a water trap, a zero valve, a sample pump and finally a sample flow sensor to the gas monitoring sensors.
The zero valve allows the gas sensors to be zeroed (during low calibration) without having to disconnect the sample line from the breathing circuit.
The pump and sample flow sensor ensure a sample gas flow rate is maintained to the monitoring sensors.
The gas monitoring sensors are electrochemical; they are specific to each gas and provide an electronic signal which is proportional to the concentration of the gas present.
Backup Delivery - If the delivery system does go into shutdown, the INOmax DSIR has an integrated backup function which provides a fixed flow of INOMAX (250 mL/min) into the injector module using a pneumatic on/off switch and a restrictor built into the delivery side of the system. This fixed flow of INOMAX will provide 20 ppm of NO when the continuous ventilator gas flow is 10 L/min. The backup is only for short term use until a replacement delivery system can be obtained. An alarm will warn the user if the backup system is turned on while the main delivery system is in use for INOMAX delivery. The INOblender can also be used as a backup.
Other Requirements
All medical gases shall conform to specifications prescribed in the United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary.  All medical gas manufacturers and fillers of medical gases shall be registered with the FDA; and all medical gases shall be manufactured, processed, packed, transported, and stored according to the FDA s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations and Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210, 211 and 201 for labeling.
All products, equipment, and services provided under the contracts awarded under this solicitation shall be in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, and local regulations.
Delivery and Quantity Requirements
The contract items will be ordered and delivered according the needs of the New York Harbor Healthcare System (NYHHS). Quantities shall be specified by the COR or designee from the NYHHS Respiratory Service. All delivery charges such as hazardous material fees, delivery fees and other surcharges shall be included in the price of the contract. 
Place of Delivery
The product will be delivered to VA NYHHS Respiratory Service, New York Campus, 423 East 23rd Street, New York, NY 11010 
Training Of Operating personnel
The price quoted shall include contractor responsibility for providing on-site orientation and training for all using personnel in operation and care of the equipment furnished. This training shall include actual demonstration and operation of the equipment, preventative maintenance, and any adjustments or other actions which may be undertaken by operating personnel in the event of failure of equipment, provided that such adjustment or action shall in no way jeopardize the Government's rights under contract guarantee clause. Upon completion of delivery, this training shall be given by qualified contractor representatives on a date to be determined by the using service POC. Operator and maintenance training shall not be conducted concurrently. 
Vendor shall submit training materials and training videos (prepared in CD or DVD format) on each piece of equipment for operation and maintenance.

<DESC><p>Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Sources Sought Synopsis for Women-Owned Small Business Information Technology Service Providers</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>Document Type:		Source Sought Synopsis<br />RFI Number:			OPIC RFI 0001-18<br />Posted Date:			27 February 2018<br />Response Date:		7 March 2018<br />NAICS Code:	541519</p>
<p>I.  Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1.	OPIC seeks to identify sources of Information Technology (IT) services provided by women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) registered in the SBA repository (https://certify.sba.gov/). OPIC will review the statements of capability provided by respondents and invite several that provide services OPIC might need to procure in the future to attend a reverse industry day at OPIC, currently planned to be held in late March. The exact date has not been set. OPIC currently does not have any specific criteria on how companies will be selected. Respondents should also not infer any procurement-related preferences from being selected or not selected to participate. OPIC has limited resources on how many companies it can accommodate and how much time its staff can devote to the reverse industry day.</p>
<p>2.	OPIC is issuing this RFI for market research purposes only. There are no solicitations currently open for any IT requirements or any specific open market or set-aside solicitations planned to be issued in the near future to which this sources sought synopsis (SSS) applies.</p>
<p>3.	This SSS is for WOSBs or variants of WOSBs (e.g., EDWOSB, 8(a) WOSB) only. No other class of small business is invited to respond. Large businesses are also not invited to respond. Responses from any business not registered in the SBA WOSB online repository will be discarded.</p>
<p>II. Call for Statements of Capabilities:  Interested and capable WOSB respondents are requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SoC) in response to the following announcement:</p>
<p>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Department of Management and Administration (DMA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) leverages information technology, management and consulting resources to support OPIC's goals to grow the OPIC portfolio and development impact, increase environmental benefit, foster productivity and efficiency and build long-term support for OPIC to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives by supporting administration goals.</p>
<p>The size of the OPIC workforce is approximately 400 strong and centrally located in Washington, DC, with some minor exceptions. OPIC's technology landscape is predominantly Oracle (EBS, CLM, OBIEE), Salesforce, Azure, Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, and custom Microsoft .Net solutions.  As one of the top federal agencies for innovation, the IT landscape is continually evolving to modernize the IT capabilities available to OPIC and its clients.  These innovations introduce a steady state of change and learning for OPIC staff, as they adopt and adapt to new and enhanced IT.</p>
<p>The OCIO is conducting market research to identify WOSBs with experience and expertise in executing IT transformation efforts, especially cloud-migration efforts as related to the aforementioned systems and platforms.  While no specific solicitations are currently planned, responses should highlight and describe support services the WOSB can provide, including those that impact OPIC's non-IT staff / basic user.</p>
<p>III. Questions or clarifications:  All questions, deadline extension requests and requested clarifications related to this SSS shall be sent via e-mail only to the primary POC listed in Section VIII below no later than 0800 Eastern,  5 March 2018.</p>
<p>IV. Small Business Consideration:  The Small Business size standard is $27.5M in annual revenues. Only responses from WOSBs will be considered.</p>
<p>V. SoC Classification:  Respondents shall provide an unclassified response to this SSS, with a sensitivity level not to exceed For Official Use Only (FOUO).  Respondents must indicate whether their responses contain proprietary information if the respondents wish for the responses to be handled as such.</p>
<p>VI. SoC format and required content:  <br />Format: Responses shall not exceed five (5) pages.  Page size shall be 8.5 x 11.  Font may not be smaller than 10-point. Legible charts, graphs, and figures may be used at the respondent's discretion.  These displays shall be clear, legible, and shall not exceed 11 x 17 inches in size. <br />Required Content: The cover page must indicate clearly that the response is related to the OPIC RFI 0001-18 and also display the respondent's CAGE code and DUNS number. The SoC must clearly indicate whether the respondent is registered in the SBA WOSB repository and specify what type of WOSB the respondent is (if other than a general WOSB). The SoC must also indicate on what GWACs (if any) the respondent has an approved pricelist or contract and provide that price list or contract number.</p>
<p>VII. Response Due Date: 12:00pm Eastern, 7 March 2018.</p>
<p>VIII. Submission Instructions:  Submit an electronic copy of the SoC in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format to the primary POC and Contracting Officer, George Sullivan, at george.sullivan@opic.gov by the Response Due Date. Hard copy responses will not be accepted. Respondents must indicate in their e-mail subject line that the SoC is submitted in response to OPIC RFI 0001-18.<br /> <br />IX.  DECLARATION:  This RFI is not a formal solicitation or RFQ.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. Responses will be used by the Government for informational purposes as part of general market research.</p>

How many projects/switchboards can you handle at one time? How large is your staff? Is sheet-steel cutting/forming and painting performed onsite at the primary manufacturing facility, or done by an outside supplier? What are typical manufacturing times for different order sizes?) 

 Technical expertise and quality assurance (How do you manage your projects? Do you have engineering and technician staff familiar with high-voltage power system protection and control design? What CAD programs do you use? What is your quality assurance program? What is the extent of functional and factory acceptance testing that you perform? Is it done in-house? What test equipment do you use?)

Any proprietary information should be so marked. The written capability statement should be received by the Contract Specialist no later than 3:00 pm Eastern Time on March 19, 2018.

The Government anticipates this to be either a Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) set-aside.  If your firm/company is a SDVOSB or VOSB, the firm/company must be VERIFIED in the VIP database (see internet site: http://vip.vetbiz.gov) as prescribed under the Veterans First Contracting Program as implemented in VAAR subpart 819.70.  The Veteran Administration is mandated by Public Law 109-461 (38 USC  8127 & 8128) to give first priority to SDVOSB and VOSB concerns if there should be sufficient firms available to compete under a set aside.  If insufficient veteran owned small business responses are received to establish the basis for setting this action aside for other than large business participation, then the action will be advertised as a small business set aside or full and open competition. In this case, all interested parties responding shall be eligible to bid. 
The NAICS 339112- Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing is applicable to this acquisition; with a size standard of 1,000 Employees. 
Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a) Prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at the System for Award Management (SAM) as a part of required registration in conjunction with FAR 4.1102(a) that states, Prospective contractors shall be registered in the (SAM) database prior to award of a contract or agreement.

<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center has a requirement to procure products and services from the European Space Agency (ESA) in support of ESA Nodes 2 &amp; 3, ESA Payload facilities located onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and the ESA Service Module (SM) for Orion. ESA has been performing the current Firm Fixed Price/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract, NNJ04GC06C, since September 17, 2004.  This proposed contract extension will extend the current contract through December 31, 2024.
<p>ESA provides engineering services and products associated with changes to the requirements baseline, functionality, or resolution of issues caused by non-compliance of NASA-supplied hardware for ESA Nodes 2 and 3. Extending the current contract will provide uninterrupted support of nominal ISS on-orbit operations of ESA Nodes 2 &amp; 3 and ESA-provided payload facilities. Specific products and services for ESA Nodes 2 &amp; 3 include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1.	Assessments and evaluation<br />2.	Analysis <br />3.	Re-design efforts necessitated by an "as-built versus as-designed" issue with NASA provided outfitting hardware or ISS Space Station Change Notices (SSCNs)<br />4.	Documentation and models<br />5.	Testing and associated support<br />6.	Changes in functionality and/or performance from that defined in the requirements baseline<br />7.	Training materials</p>
<p>ESA provides engineering services and spares associated with sustaining ESA-provided payloads facilities such as the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for the International Space Station (MELFI) and the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG). Specific products and services for the ESA Payload Facilities include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />1.	  Logistics (does not include launch) and maintenance support<br />2.	Sustaining Engineering support for anomaly investigations and failure identification<br />3.	Technical support for failed subassemblies<br />4.	Provision of ESA-provided payload facilities' spares<br />5.	Other required services and hardware necessary for the sustainment of the ESA-provided payload facilities</p>
<p>ESA provides hardware to support the build of the Orion SM. As the SM is provided by ESA, NASA will fulfill near-term parts procurement requirements for upcoming Exploration Missions (EM) as part of this action.</p>
<p>NASA/JSC intends to procure the items/services from ESA on a sole source basis due to ESA maintaining proprietary data rights to ESA Nodes 2 &amp; 3, ESA Payload Facilities, and Orion SM hardware. This action will also allow for uninterrupted support of on-orbit operations of the Nodes and ESA Payload facilities.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 14, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html</p>

Request for SF 330 for Project # 595-18-102  at VA Lebanon, PA

This announcement is for the selection of an Architect /Engineer Firm to perform design services, engineering,  produce technical specifications, working drawings, and cost estimates, as-built drawings, and provide construction period services, and site visits for the Construction Project: 595-18-102  Correct Facade Issues Phase 3.

This announcement is set-aside for firms classified as "Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business" under NAICS code 541310 Architectural Services. The magnitude of construction for the above referenced project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The estimated duration of design is 270 Days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. The contract shall remain active through Construction Period Services.

This is not a Request for Proposal and an award will not be made with this announcement.  This announcement is a request for SF 330s from qualified firms that meet the professional and set aside requirements listed in this announcement. The proposed services will be obtained by a negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract

Contract Award Procedure:  Before a small business is proposed as a potential contractor, they shall be certified by VETbiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) via internet site at http://www.sam.gov. Failure of a proposed SDVOSB to be certified by the CVE at the time the SF 330 is submitted will result in their elimination from further consideration for award. The government will evaluate the SF330s  received and a minimum of the three most highly qualified firms shall be called back for interviews.  After interviews, the most highly qualified firm will receive additional information and be requested to submit a proposal. The SF330 must address identified capabilities that are summarized in 1) through 8).  The Professional Qualification and Specialized Experience/ Technical Competence factors are slightly more important than the other six factors which are listed in descending order of importance.   1) Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services:  This is intended to evaluate the personal experience of firm members who work in the firm's project office and are scheduled to be assigned to the design team.  The key positions should include Project Managers, Quality Assurance Managers, Architectural Design, Structural Engineers, Fire Protection Engineers, and Environmental Engineers (Industrial Hygentist). Firms may submit any other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in Specialized Experience.  2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the type of work required: This factor evaluates the experience of the firm and design team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for this contract. The project will consist of correcting faade issues with building 19 and 22.  This includes replacing lintels, incidental masonry repair such as repointing and removing and replacing vents and louvers.  Extra consideration may be given for experience designing projects for Department of Veterans Affairs Facilities.  NOTE:  Ensure that projects listed were completed by the firm as the prime contractor and not as a subcontractor or projects completed by key personnel while employed by another firm. 3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies (Particularly Department of Veterans Affairs) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. 
Note:  Project Past Performance information for projects performed shall be evaluated as either Relevant or Not Relevant.  Not Relevant projects shall not be evaluated. 4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time:  this factor evaluates the ability of the A-E firm to, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the project in the required time. 5)  Location:  This factor evaluates the distance from the A-E firms design office from the location of work (Lebanon VA Medical Center).  The personnel identified as the design team staff are expected to work in the design office identified for evaluation of this factor.  6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principle officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.   7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services. 8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.

<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT:</p>
<p>Save the Date: The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC) will hold a Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) with industry from 2 - 4 May 2018 at the Myer Auditorium on Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland.</p>
<p>The CERDEC TIM with Industry is an opportunity for industry to learn about CERDEC's core mission and research and development plans and strategies. The 2018 CERDEC TIM will introduce a new format transitioning from small breakout sessions to large group sessions that will accommodate all attendees at one time. The large group sessions will present mission area details from the decomposition of requirements to the formulation of specific research and development activities. This interchange is intended to kick-off a series of focused industry engagements intended to maximize the mutual benefit of Independent Research and Development investments.</p>
<p>PROGRAM AGENDA AND MISSION AREAS: TBD and will be shared in a follow on announcement.</p>
<p>INTENTION:</p>
<p>In order to exploit industry creativity and innovation, the Army must work more closely with industry in the earliest stages of the product lifecycle, before requirements are firm and before design concepts are determined. The sooner industry learns of the Army's interest in a new capability, the sooner industry can begin to explore or invest in applicable technologies and formulate ideas for Army consideration. The intent of the sessions will be to enhance Government-and-industry communication and enable industry to quickly respond to emerging requirements with innovative technology solutions and partnerships. This event will serve as the kick-off meeting, designed to:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist industry in identifying and aligning efforts with CERDEC's Mission Areas<br /> &bull; Articulate high-level capabilities and their derived technical requirements <br /> &bull; Present technology roadmaps and CERDEC's strategies to fulfill these needs</p>
<p>FINAL NOTES:</p>
<p>Information presented during the event is for planning purposes, does not represent a pre-solicitation synopsis, does not constitute an invitation for bid or request for proposal, and is not a commitment by the government to purchase the desired products and services.</p>
<p>The event is currently planned to be held at the Unclassified - For Official Use Only level. Further distribution statements may apply but final determination has not been made at this time.</p>
<p>Registration is anticipated to open 5 March and close 2 April. Due to the high-level of interest in this event, registration will be limited. It is anticipated the limit will be set to no more than three (3) per company at this time. While priority registration will be given to industry, the forum is also open to academia and other government organizations. There will be no on-site substitutions or registration on any day of the TIM.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army holds the right to cancel and/or change session event times, dates and locations under certain conditions. These conditions usually include, but are not limited to: inclement weather, event venue cancellation or rescheduling, speaker cancellation or rescheduling, and insufficient number of participants for the event. The U.S. Army holds the right to cancel the event for any reason up to and including the day of the event. In the event that the U.S Army must cancel the event, the U.S. Army will not be responsible for costs incurred in preparation. In the event of predicted inclement weather, a decision will be made by 5pm on the prior day. If the event is cancelled, the notice will be posted on this website and an email will be sent to all registered participants.</p>

These space refrigerators and freezers are used extensively in support of the International Space Station (ISS) Program. As a result of two Visiting Vehicle incidents, manifest increases, increased spares to reduce risk, refurbishments, new hardware, and protection for loss of future vehicle the contract has burned though contract value at a more accelerated rate than originally planned.</p>

The GLACIER and Polar hardware were fully developed by UAB under previous contracts with NASA, therefore, the technical expertise and inherent knowledge of these systems resides with UAB.</p>
<p>In addition to UAB's unique technical knowledge of the GLACIER and Polar units, UAB maintains data rights and proprietary software the for MERLIN units. The internally generated data that contains technical data on the MERLIN units is exclusively controlled by UAB.

<DESC>Solicit Comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements for the Construction to Expand the Western Currency Facility (WCF) Production and Access, Fort Worth, Texas <br />Source Sought for PLAs Regarding Solicitation: W9126G-18-R-0066<br />Title: Soliciting Comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for the Construction to Expand the Western Currency Facility (WCF) Production and Access, Fort Worth, Texas<br />Description: The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for Construction to Expand the Western Currency Facility (WCF) Production and Access, Fort Worth, Texas.<br />Range of Magnitude: $100 - $250 Million. <br />Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br />a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b.) The complexity of the project.<br />c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br />PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br />Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy:<br />a.) Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.<br />b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br />1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...<br />2.) Be consistent with law.<br />Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements.<br />In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br />a.) Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Fort Worth area? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?<br />b.) Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br />c.) Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br />d.) Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?<br />e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? <br />f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br />g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />h.) Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Fort Worth area?<br />i.) Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?<br />Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: Natasha.P.Kennedu@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 09 March 2018. <br />Agency/Contracting Office: <br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District<br />ATTN: CESWF-CT (Rm 2A17)<br />819 Taylor Street<br />Fort Worth, Texas 76102-0300

<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for a project manager and technician in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to Enliten Management Group, Inc. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: Executive Information Systems, LLC. Lt Col Peter A. Sandness, AFLCMC/AQ, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Kyle Matranga at (937) 656-7377 or e-mail: Kyle.Matranga@us.af.mil. Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Lt Col Peter A. Sandness, can be reached at (937) 255-5512, e-mail: <a>peter.sandness@us.af.mil</a>.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

52.209-5 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law(Deviation) (March 2012) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<DESC>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities<br /><br />Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. <br /><br />The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service. <br />Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits. <br /><br />You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.<br /><br />Further reference, detailed instructions, and required documents are included in the solicitation attachments.<br /><br />Good Luck...and we look forward to your interest in joining Contract Delivery Services.<br />

<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.13 per hour, or $165.20 per week, or $715.87 per month*</p>

<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the FAR Subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures by soliciting from a single source pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b).<br />Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(3) the rationale for the brand name justification is this brand-name assay kit is needed to ensure continuity, consistency, and accuracy of future test and experiment results with prior tests and experiments conducted using this brand-name assay kit.<br /><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97, dated January 24, 2018.</p>
<p>(iv) The associated NAICS code 325414 Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This requirement is not a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>(v) <strong>Background</strong>: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on getting more treatments to more patients more quickly. Several thousand genetic diseases affect humans, of which only about 500 have any treatment. NCATS is directly addressing this problem by discovering new technologies and other approaches that could greatly accelerate the process of developing and deploying solutions that can be used by all translational researchers. The Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) biology program's mission is to encourage and speed the development of new treatments for diseases with high-unmet medical needs. One of the on-going projects in TRND is the Malaria Williamson project that is focused on developing drug candidates to block malaria transmission. The project requires a biochemical assay to counter screen a protein kinase called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase implicated in a wide array of cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The goal of the screening of mTOR activity is to exclude any compounds that could be harmful to human mTOR. This requisition is to acquire the PerkinElmer brand LANCE&reg; Ultra kinase assay kit, consisting of a peptide and an antibody, to continue our efforts of developing an alternate kinase assay in the Malaria Williamson project. This is a brand name-only requirement. This brand-name assay kit is needed to ensure continuity, consistency, and accuracy of test and experiment results with prior tests and experiments conducted using this brand-name assay kit. The LANCE&reg; Ultra kinase assay has been used in a different project the TRND program is working on and will ensure results consistent with that of previous KinEASE assays in the TRND program.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304, NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-72, CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71, NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>(XIII) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.<br />(XIV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 5 P.M.

<DESC>The USDA NRCS North Carolina State Office is in need to have wetland delineation and determinations completed in accordance with the attached Statement of Work. This agreement will result in a per acre price per county over the course of 5 years of wetland delineation and determination. Based on 2017 data; the average size of wetland determination requests are 20.2 acres.
<p>The deliverables apply to on-site field investigations for Preliminary Technical Determinations for Wetland Conservation issued by North Carolina NRCS.</p>
<p>Wetland determinations are conducted for USDA participants in order for them to maintain compliance with Wetland Provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended. These determinations are requested by the participant by submitting the Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation Certification form (AD-1026) at the local Farm Service Agency office. The AD-1026 is then transmitted to the local NRCS office. The AD-1026 request with relevant documentation gathered by the local NRCS personnel is then submitted to the NRCS State Office to review and record as a pending wetland determination request. Once the determination is conducted, a Preliminary Technical Determination (PTD) is sent to the participant outlining its results and the appeal rights afforded to the participant. Once received, the participant has 30 days to appeal the PTD. If no notification of appeal is submitted by the participant during the 30 day period, the PTD is then signed by NRCS and considered as an official certified wetland determination.</p>

However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.</span></p>

<p><br />1. Introduction and Purpose of the Request for Proposal (RFP)<br />1.1. Background on Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) <br />The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC or Commission) is an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government with regulatory oversight over the United States Postal Service (USPS or Postal Service). It is composed of five Commissioners supported by staff from its four operating offices, one of which is the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC). OAC is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the Commission in both domestic and international matters.</p>
<p>The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Pub. L. 109-435, 120 Stat. 3250-51, established the Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) to fund the long-term retiree health benefits for postal employees, retirees, and their survivors. Beginning in FY 2007 through FY 2016, the PAEA required the Postal Service to make specified annual payments into the RHBF. In FY 2017, the funding of the RHBF was changed by law to amortization of the unfunded obligation. The OPM revalued the FY 2016 RHBF unfunded liability at $56.9 billion and assessed an annual amortization payment of $955 million to liquidate the unfunded obligation by FY 2056 and a participant normal cost payment of $3.3 billion, both due September 30.<br />1.2. Recent Developments on Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) <br />On January 30, 2018, the Postal Service filed a request under 5 U.S.C. &sect; 8909a(d)(5)(A). The request is docketed at the Commission as Docket No. SS2018-2.</p>
<p>In its request, the Postal Service asks the Commission to examine the actuarial appropriateness and accuracy of OPM using government-wide assumptions rather than those specific to Postal Service employees and annuitants. It also observes that the propriety of full use of postal-specific assumptions has been recognized by the Postal Service's OIG.</p>
<p>The request seeks a Commission finding upon review and comment on an actuary's report that: (1) it is appropriate and more accurate to use the postal-specific assumptions than the assumptions used by OPM in calculating the RHB liability and (2) that OPM should re-determine the unfunded liability using such assumptions.</p>
<p>2. Objective <br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy of <br />the current assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's RHB liability. <br />3. Tasks<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a report, documentation and deliverables in verbal, written or electronic format (as appropriate) and shall provide weekly written progress reports.<br />4. Disclaimer<br />Offerors are advised that the PRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFP; all costs associated with responding to this RFP will be incurred solely at the interested party's expense. <br />The PRC reserves the right to contact any respondent to this notice for the sole purpose of enhancing PRC's understanding of the responder's proposal. The content of any responses to this RFP may be reflected in any subsequent solicitations.<br />5. Confidentiality<br />All information included in responses to this RFP is confidential and only for the use of the PRC. No information included in offeror proposals or in discussions connected to this RFP may be disclosed to any other party outside the PRC without the written consent of the offeror.<br />6. About the PRC<br />The PRC is an independent agency that is part of the executive branch of the Federal government. The PRC has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, with expanded responsibilities under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The PRC is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a term of six years. <br />Assisting the PRC is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The PRC is organized into four operating offices: <br />&bull; Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC)<br />&bull; Office of the General Counsel (OGC)<br />&bull; Office of Public Affairs and Government Relations (PAGR)<br />&bull; Office of the Secretary and Administration (OSA) <br />The PRC maintains an independent office for its Inspector General. <br />OAC (39 CFR 3002.12) is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the PRC in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for PRC review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, amendments to international postal treaties and conventions, among other issues. <br />The General Counsel (39 CFR 3002.13) directs and coordinates the functions of the OGC and is directly responsible for the counseling and advisory services set forth in 39 CFR 3000.735-102. In accordance with 3001.8 of the rules of practice, the General Counsel does not appear as an attorney in hearings in any proceeding before the PRC and takes no part in the preparation of evidence or argument presented in such hearings.<br />PAGR (39 CFR 3002.15) serves as the public face of the PRC. As such, it is the PRC's primary resource in support of public outreach and education, media relations, and relationships with Congress, the United States Postal Service, and other government agencies. PAGR provides information for consumers and responds to their inquiries; informal complaints regarding individual rate and service inquiries are referred to the Consumer Advocate of the Postal Service. Public Affairs and Government Relations staff also works closely with members of Congress and their staff.<br />OSA (39 CFR 3002.11) provides management and staff support to the PRC's operational offices (including the Office of Inspector General), the PRC's strategic plan, and various initiatives of the Executive Branch. OSA ensures that the PRC has the physical, financial, technological and human capital infrastructure needed to accomplish its mission. The effort led by OSA provides financial management, records management, administrative and organizational support, planning and human capital resources for the PRC.<br />The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was established in June, 2007, as required by an amendment to the Inspector General Act of 1978 included in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-435 sec. 605).<br />7. Scope<br />The Commission requires actuarial consultant services to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's Postal Service's RHB liability. <br />7.1. Project Details<br />The actuarial consultant shall:</p>
<p>&#61607; Review the existing assumptions employed by OPM to separately determine their proper use in determining RHB liabilities apportioned to the Postal Service;</p>
<p>&#61607; Review the appropriateness and accuracy of using government wide assumptions to separately determine RHB liabilities apportioned to the Postal Service;</p>
<p>&#61607; Determine the advantages and disadvantages of using postal-specific assumptions from both the perspectives of the Postal Service and the government as a whole when determining the RHB liability;</p>
<p>&#61607; As applicable, compare OPM's current assumptions to standard or typical sets of assumptions used by other semi-government, government bodies or private sector entities;</p>
<p>&#61607; Meet with OPM, USPS and USPS OIG actuaries, as needed, to discuss the appropriateness and accuracy of methods and results;</p>
<p>&#61607; Support PRC staff members in identifying and assessing appropriate methods in selection of assumptions; and</p>
<p>&#61607; Provide related supporting data and, to the extent practicable, models or descriptions thereof to PRC staff.<br />&#61607; Support PRC staff members <br />7.2. Report Overview <br />Provide a written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate assumptions and an evaluation of the benefits of using assumptions specific to the Postal Service in its calculation of RHB obligations. The evaluation will include:</p>
<p>1. A comparison of OPM's assumptions, where appropriate, to assumptions typically used for calculating retiree health liabilities;</p>
<p>2. Specific discussion of the benefits of using postal-specific assumptions from both the perspectives of the Postal Service and the government as a whole when determining the RHB liability. <br />8. RHB Liability Examination <br />The ultimate goal of this project is to have an actuarial consultant service to review the appropriateness and accuracy of the current and prospective assumptions used by OPM for the determination of the Postal Service's RHB liability. <br />To achieve this goal, the PRC has outlined the requirements for the following areas: <br />8.1. American Academy of Actuaries <br />The actuarial consultant must be a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries, have extensive experience in the retirement health benefits, and must have experience analyzing pension issues in a legal and legislative context. <br />8.2. Disclosure <br />The actuarial consultant must disclose all current and previous work performed for USPS or any other federal agency. The actuarial consultant also must disclose any pending negotiations for professional engagements with USPS or other federal agencies, apart from this SOW. <br />8.3. Qualifications<br />The actuarial consultant shall provide a description of qualifications, proposed work methods, an estimate of the length of time needed to complete the project, the total cost of the project, and the basis for the calculation. <br />8.4. Timeline <br />The actuarial consultant shall acknowledge that if selected to provide professional services pursuant to this SOW, all work will be conducted with the understanding that time is of the essence in meeting the contractual deadline and that no extension of the deadline will be allowed. <br />9. Deliverables Guideline<br />This section is the deliverable guideline for this project. At this time, we anticipate a work plan to include all the items listed below. However, the vendor's work/task plan to implement the scope of work is at the discretion of the vendor and should be included as part of your capabilities. Acceptance of the proposed deliverables is subject to the approval of the Commission.<br />9.1. Date due: 90 days from Contract Execution <br />Provide a written report evaluating the determinative factors in assessing appropriate and accurate assumptions and an evaluation of the benefits of using assumptions specific to the Postal Service in its calculation of RHB obligations. The evaluation will include: <br />9.2. Final Report <br />Task 1: Produce a Final written report that includes:<br />(a) A comparison of OPM's assumptions, where appropriate, to assumptions typically used for calculating retiree health liabilities;</p>
<p>(b) Specific discussion of the benefits of using postal-specific assumptions from both the perspectives of the Postal Service and the government as a whole when determining the RHB liability.<br />(c) Due date is 90 days from Contract Execution (Estimated 22 July 2018)<br />9.3. Briefing<br />Task 2: Briefing the PRC:<br />(a) Formal oral briefing (PRC Main Conference Room)<br />(b) Oral briefing must include presentation slides.<br />(c) Date TBD (Estimated 31 July 2018) <br />9.4. Review<br />Task 3: Commission and Staff Review Session: <br />(a) While preparing its report, the actuarial consultant shall be available to conduct up to six briefing sessions with the Commission and other interested parties and;</p>
<p>(b) Shall be available to assist the Commission in addressing comments on the consultants report prior to Contract Close Date (Estimated 30 September 2018).</p>
<p>(c) Dates are TBD<br />10. Assistance from the Commission<br />The Commission will provide the contractor with background documents and data, as well as make staff available to answer any questions the contractor may have while completing the deliverables.<br />11. Place of Performance <br />PRC's office at 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200W, Washington DC, 20268 and at place of business.<br />12. Quality Control<br />As a micro-agency, the PRC has found that contractors can contribute significantly to the PRC and its mission success. Whenever the PRC awards a contract, it expects to receive top quality service. This section provides the crucial foundation for identifying, measuring and ensuring quality standards for consultative services.<br />The contractor will provide information, guidance, and support to the PRC for its Quality Assurance (QA) of the services provided under the contract. QA is a systematic and planned pattern of actions taken to ensure that necessary technical requirements are established, that the deliverables conform to these requirements, and that acceptable performance is achieved. Thus, the contractor will help the PRC to verify that the contractor's own Quality Control (QC) is sufficient and that their deliverables meet the agreed upon criteria. To plan and conduct QC, the contractor considers among other factors the generic criteria listed in the next paragraph.<br />A useful service for the government is delivered in a timely manner and thus the quality of performance exhibited by the contractor, will depend on their ability to deliver their services by established deadlines. The PRC expects accuracy of the services and deliverables rendered on time by the contractor. Procedures and communication between the contractor and the PRC concerning the contract shall be unmistakably clear to avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities. The procedures and deliverables of the contractor shall be consistent and in compliance with this statement of work, and shall result in services rendered that effectively meet the PRC's needs. The contractor's work shall be done in an efficient manner, and their services under the contract shall meet the highest standards (e.g., user friendly, innovative, and provide the best value to the government).<br />With the signatures of the contractor and the Contracting Officer on a finalized contract and any associated task orders, the contractor certifies that it can meet the quality standards and criteria as cited within the agreed-upon cost framework. For substandard contractor performance under the contract where delays, cost overruns as well as deviations from the agreed upon acceptable quality levels occur, the contractor will perform rework of the deliverables at no additional cost to the Government. An example of a delay that deviates from an acceptable quality level would be where timelines and contract specifications are not implemented, requiring rework of deliverables and additional cost. If the PRC is responsible for the delays or cost overruns, the PRC will incur the additional cost.<br />13. PRC Rights<br />&bull; The PRC reserves the right to amend this RFP, and/or to make no award or cancel this RFP. <br />&bull; The PRC reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this solicitation, to negotiate and award separately with competing respondents, and to accept that proposal which, in its judgment, is in the best interests of the PRC. This does not necessarily mean the lowest bid.<br />&bull; The PRC reserves the right to make a full or partial award in response to this RFP.<br />&bull; At any time prior to the deadline for submission of bids, the PRC may amend this RFP by issuing addenda. Any addendum issued shall be part of this document and shall be communicated in writing to all who have obtained this RFP directly from the PRC. To give prospective contractors sufficient time in which to consider an addendum in preparing their bids, the PRC may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for the submission of offers.<br />&bull; The PRC reserves its right to rescind an offer at any time for any reason.<br />&bull; Pre-award Survey: The PRC reserves the right to perform a pre-award survey that may include, but is not limited to: (1) interviews with individuals to establish their ability to perform contract duties under the project conditions; (2) a review of the prime contractor's financial condition, business, and personnel procedures; and, site visits to the offeror's institution.<br />14.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. <br />Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. <br />Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Description: SERVICES-  Remediation and Removal of Hazardous Materials
This is a Combined Synopsis Solicitation for commercial items and will be conducted in accordance FAR Part 13 (FAC 2005-95). This acquisition uses a tiered evaluation method of quotes, also known as a cascading evaluation of quotes. The solicitation is considered set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns but a tiered or cascading order of precedence for evaluating quotes is specified in the solicitation/Request for Quote document. If no award can be made at the first tier to a SDVOSB, evaluations will continue at the next lower tier until award can be made.

<p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation ("synopsitation" hereafter), which is expected to result in award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for commercial items, i.e. Disappearing Filament Pyrometer<strong>, </strong>as described under the attachment titled "Statement of Work." The synopsitation is prepared in accordance with (IAW) the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>Each Offeror will be evaluated on a contractor-provided approach formulated to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). The proposal should fully outline the capabilities and methodology to provide the services as required.</p>
<p>2.	PAST PERFORMANCE (non-cost)</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated on their recent (within the past 3 years) performance of relevant services as described in the requirements of the SOW.  Past performance will be evaluated to determine that each offeror has performed in a satisfactory manner in the performance of similar services as those specified in the SOW and whose past performance does not pose a risk to the Government.   Offerors should provide up to three (3) references only for the same or similar work performed for Federal, State, and local government and private clients.  For each services project used to demonstrate the relevant past performance, the Offeror must provide appropriate point of contact information for the individual within the client agency/firm overseeing the services performed.  An Offeror may also provide information on problems encountered on the identified projects and the offer's corrective actions.

(1)
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the senders request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers.

Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.<BR><BR>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<BR><BR>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.
(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.<BR><BR>(ii) If the General Services Administration, Department of Agriculture, or Department of Veterans Affairs issued this solicitation, a single copy of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained free of charge by submitting a request to the addressee in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this provision.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.
 
      (c)  Cyber incident reporting requirement.
 
            (1)  When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractors ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall
 
                    (i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractors network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractors ability to provide operationally critical support; and
 
                    (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.

      (g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
 
      (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<BR><BR>i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD.

      (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<BR><BR>(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractors responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
 
      (m)  Subcontracts. The Contractor shall
 
            (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties.

The Spud Inc sled strap is made from the most durable webbing that will never wear out. Stop using cables and chains that get frayed and have sharp edges to cut you with, and start using the Spud Inc sled strap. One end is fitted with a large shackle that will fit most any sled and the other end has a 4 inch wide delta ring that will slide over a standard power belt. The sled strap is great for using with our lower body and upper body sled straps. Want an alternative to a heavy power belt when pulling the sled? Try the Spud, Inc. sled pulling belt, made so you can easily pull forwards, backwards or sideways. If you are planning to pull a heavy load then you might consider the Strongman harness which distributes the load across the upper body making it more comfortable for maximal loading. Maybe, you are training your sprints. If so, our track harness is a good light weight alternative for sprints with your sled.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
(7) The Standard Form 1449.
(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractors representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
