<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1362.
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior has a requirement for processing data from offshore oil and gas well logs. PLEASE READ THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. The following is a Statement of Objectives for this effort. Offerors are invited to comment on the Statement of Objectives by arranging a teleconference or meeting with the Contracting Officer. Each offeror will be allowed 30 minutes to discuss the Statement of Objectives and make suggestions. While the Government will carefully consider all such suggestions, but any changes to the Statement of Objectives will be made solely at the Contracting Officer's discretion.   STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:      The goals of this Contract are threefold. First, to create a process which will provide the Minerals Management Service's (MMS) Gulf of Mexico, Pacific and the Alaska Regions with the delivery of complete, defect-free sets of processed, high quality open hole digital (vector and image) well log data in a timely manner from a web-enabled remote data management system. Second, to provide the MMS with complete, defect-free sets of historical open hole digital (vector and image) well log data as needed, via this same delivery system. Third, to create a process in which the Contractor will serve as the sole GOMR agent to store and release vector curve data to the public when it becomes public information. Currently the proprietary period is 26 months. The scope of the contract may later be expanded by the MMS to include other types of digital well data (e.g. directional surveys, velocity surveys, etc.) and the release of OCS vector well curve data for the Pacific and Alaska Regions. The Contractor will be expected to concurrently modify, upgrade, and/or add to their systems to remain compatible with the MMS' electronic environment and its evolving business practices. Bidders are encouraged to be innovative in their approach toward achieving the objectives of the Contract stated below. These approaches should be compatible with the MMS' initiative to reduce the amount of paper (hardcopy logs) maintained by the agency. They should also enhance the MMS' efforts to decrease the timeline associated with the handling of open hole well data, from the initial receipt of well log data to the final delivery of processed curve files. Objectives 1.	Management of data sets processed for the MMS: The operators will submit Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) digital (vector and image) data as well as hardcopy logs directly to the Contractor. The Contractor will store and manage these wellbore data sets. When wellbore identification is confirmed, a reference copy of the original digital (vector and image) data set for each wellbore must be made available for immediate download by the MMS. When processing is complete, a certified defect-free copy of each data set will be made available to the MMS for downloading. 2.	Complete, defect-free sets of high quality open hole digital (vector and image) well log data provided to the MMS in a timely manner: Complete, error-free data sets will be required for all wellbores that TD during the life of the contract. Data sets will consist of vector curve data, hardcopy logs, and/or image data. The volume of data will vary with offshore drilling activity. However, the Contractor may expect to process data for approximately 1200 wellbores a year. The MMS will periodically supply the Contractor with a list of recently drilled and/or completed offshore wells. This list will contain proprietary data elements that may be used by the Contractor to match the data sets received from the operators to a unique wellbore. The MMS will also supply an inventory of open hole logging tools run in each wellbore. Additional data elements can be included to ensure efficiency in the Contractor's work processes. 3.	Data imaging: The Contractor will provide the MMS with images (color or black and white/gray as appropriate) of all hardcopy logs submitted by the operators. 4.	Historical open hole data: The MMS will require open hole digital (vector and image) well log data for historical wells over the life of the contract. The volume is expected to be, at most, 50 wells per year. 5.	State and Federal Lands: Upon request the MMS Alaska Region will require processed data sets for specific wells on State and Federal lands. While requests for data will depend of exploration activity, the Alaska Region expects to request data for approximately 20 wells per year. 6.	Release of data to the public:  The Contractor will serve as the sole point of release for GOMR digital vector curve data to the public. The only data required to be released to the public will be the original data submitted by the operators. This process will be coordinated with the MMS Public Information Unit. The GOMR will provide the release dates for the data.  7.	High-value digital curves sent to the MMS must readily load into GeoFrame projects without errors or warnings: The Contractor shall extract a subset of the open hole vector data, identified as "high-value curves," from each digital data set. High-value curves consist of these general curve types: SP; GR; ILD or LLD; RHOB or DPHI; NPHI; DT; CALI or DCAL; and DRHO. When both high-resolution (sample rate < 0.5 feet) and standard resolution (sample rate = 0.5 feet) curve data are available, both shall be considered high-value and processed similarly. After processing, these curves must be GeoFrame-ready and load into MMS GeoFrame projects without errors or warnings. GeoFrame files that must be updated by the Contractor will be supplied by the MMS. 8.	Workstation-ready high-value curves: The Contractor will provide, at a minimum, the following workstation-ready curve processing functions for all GeoFrame-ready curve data: 1) all curves depth matched to a primary depth reference curve; 2) SP baseline shift corrections; 3) advanced sonic editing; 4) curve despiking; 5) interpolation of minor data gaps; 6) verification of curve units; and 7) selection of the highest quality curve data if duplicate curves are submitted. The Contractor shall keep a journal of all the processing functions completed for each curve. 9.	Data delivery: Operators will submit proprietary wellbore data sets (vector, image and hardcopy data) directly to the Contractor. The Contractor must be able to receive data sets at their place of business and via electronic submission to a secure web site. The Contractor will deliver digital data files to the MMS. These data files will consist of fully processed, (i.e. GeoFrame-ready curves with workstation-ready processing), high-value vector curve data, and all image files, as well as an image index file. All vector curve files delivered to the MMS must be formatted in a file format chosen by the MMS. These files must "successfully" pass an appropriate certify program with no defects or warnings. All downloads of digital curves and image data from the Contractor's database as well as processed "high value" data sets will be delivered to the MMS directly from the Contractor's web site. An alternate delivery system will be provided by the Contractor to ensure timely delivery of data in the event either the Contractor or MMS lose Internet connectivity. 10.	Software: The Contractor will provide software that tracks the individual items submitted in each data set from initial receipt to final delivery of digital well log data to the MMS. This software shall identify each data item received, all defects in the data, and the corrections and the processing of the data. The tracking database shall be cumulative and maintained throughout the life of the Contract. The MMS will use this database to generate reports and queries, and monitor the Contractor's performance. The Contractor's software must be compatible with the MMS' corporate database.

<DESC>PEST MANAGEMENT SPECIFICATIONS-1.INTRODUCTION It is the intent of the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program in compliance with DoD Instruction 4150.7, for the premises covered by this contract.  A copy of the subject document will be available for review in the Procurement and Contracts Office.  IPM is a multidimensional program that coordinates pest management activities with sanitation, waste management, and structural maintenance.  It involves identifying specific sites of actual or potential pest infestation(s), suppressing existing populations with corrective solutions, and managing infestation opportunities by disrupting harborage, food and moisture availability, and denying access.

The Contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment necessary to provide the monitoring, inspecting, trapping, and product application aspects of the IPM program.  The Contractor shall make detailed, site-specific recommendations for structural and procedural modifications in order to achieve pest suppression.  The Contractor shall provide evidence in his/her proposal of sufficient expertise in entomology, pest management, and IPM principles and practices to effectively carry out these responsibilities.

The Contractor is responsible for suppressing all insect, arachnid (including Loxosceles sp.), rodent (including vole and mole) populations, and any other pest not specifically excluded from this contract.  Populations of these pests located on the exterior grounds, but within the property boundaries of the buildings are included.  All concession spaces are included under this contract.

The following pests are excluded from this contract: birds, with the exception of pigeons and birds that stray inside the buildings; wood destroying insects, with the exception of swarming reproductive termites; and pests located on the exterior grounds that are associated specifically with ornamental and turf pest management, with the exception of rodents.

2.GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS-2.1.INITIAL INSPECTION:  The Contractor?s Staff Entomologist shall conduct a thorough inspection of the premises during the first month of this contract.  The purpose of this initial inspection is for the Contractor to evaluate the pest management needs of the buildings and to discuss these needs with the Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) and the Respective Building Managers.  Identification of problem areas and structural features or personnel practices that are contributing to pest infestations shall be discussed.  The Contractor shall respond to routine service requests while performing this inspection.

2.2.SUBMISSION OF PLAN:  Within ten (10) workdays following the initial inspection, the Contractor shall develop a pest management plan and inspection and service schedule for each building.  This written plan and schedule shall be submitted to the COR for approval.  Following notice of approval, the Contractor shall implement the plan and schedule within five (5) working days.  If disapproved, the Contractor has three (3) work days to submit a revised plan and schedule.

2.3.MONITORING AND INSPECTION:  A critical aspect of the pest management plan shall be implementation of a monitoring and inspection program to identify infested zones and allow an objective assessment of pest population levels, and to identify procedural and structural deficiencies that contribute to pest infestations.  The Contractor shall report findings and make detailed, site specific recommendations in writing for corrective action to the COR.  The Contractor shall give special attention to the Government sanitation, waste management, and repair/alteration activities.  Recommendations to the Government that can aid in the overall pest suppression effort may involve improvement in cleaning or storage practices, installation or repair of screens and barriers, application of caulk and other sealants, patching of structural gaps, repairing leaks, and draining or filling exterior sites.  Glue traps shall be used as pest population indicators and placed in locations most frequented by invertebrate pests, especially in janitorial closets and in space adjoining food handling concessions.

In addition, the Contractor shall conduct complete surveys of the exterior grounds to monitor pigeon, wildlife, and all rodent activity. 

All monitoring, inspection, and surveys shall be accomplished as needed, but at least monthly for the duration of the contract.

Note:  The Contractor?s representative(s) assigned to the Pentagon to address routine pest service requests is expected to be on site Monday through Friday, excluding Government holidays, from 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM.


2.4.RECORD KEEPING:  The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining complete and accurate records for each building.  Records shall include, but not be limited to the following: monitoring data indicating pest population levels (graphs and/or charts shall be utilized to reflect monthly and seasonal variation), locations of pest infestations, numbers of pests trapped or killed, new rodent burrows observed, etc.; inspection data indicating findings and recommendations concerning other program areas involved in the IPM process; pesticide application data including the name of the product used or applied, method of application, location(s) of treated area(s), Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), etc.; and the location and service of all bait stations and trapping devices on the premises.

2.5.SERVICE:  The Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the detailed pest management plan, and inspection and service schedule developed for each building.  Services that do not adversely affect tenant health or productivity shall be performed during the regular hours of operation in the various buildings.  Access to building space, including restricted areas, and the scheduling of service shall be coordinated with the COR and the respective Building Manager.  When it is necessary to perform work on weekends or outside the regularly scheduled hours set in the Contractor?s plan and schedule, the contractor shall notify the COR and the respective Building Manager at least two (2) work days in advance.  If a particular treatment requires an area to be vacated; it shall be the Contractor?s responsibility to notify the COR and the respective Building Manager at least two (2) work days in advance of the treatment, provide and post all necessary signage, ensure the security of the area being treated, and remove signage when the area is safe for entry.

Trapping devices (including glue boards) used in rodent management must be checked daily.  Rodents killed (including dead carcasses on the exterior grounds) or trapped shall be disposed by the Contractor within twenty-four (24) hours.  Traps shall be placed out of general view and located so they will not be affected by routine cleaning procedures.  All bait boxes shall be mapped, serviced on a scheduled basis, and maintained in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, assuring the safety of non-target species.

The Contractor shall be aware of and comply with all Federal, State, and Local laws, regulations, or special ordinances regarding nuisance wildlife management.  All box-type traps used to live trap nuisance wildlife such as squirrels, raccoons, woodchucks, skunks, feral cats, fox, and opossums shall be checked daily.  Trapped animals shall be removed from DoD property and safely transferred to the Animal Welfare League of Arlington.  The Contractor is required to have a thorough understanding of the animal?s biology and behavior to ensure that live trapping is conducted humanely and professionally.

Once pigeons are considered to be a nuisance by the COR, the Contractor shall be directed to implement a pest management program.  The Contractor shall insure that all of the necessary precautions are taken to protect non-target species and wildlife.  Baiting shall be administered according to the manufacturer?s label.  Downed birds shall be recovered promptly and disposed of as the label directs.

When active mosquito breeding sites are identified, the Contractor representative shall alert the COR and use available methods (tip and toss, larvacide, etc.) to manage immature mosquito population(s).  

All trapping devices, bait boxes and trays shall be labeled and dated at the time of installation and each servicing, accounted for at all times, and removed from the premises covered by this contract at its conclusion.

As an IPM tactic, the Contractor shall seal minor cracks, crevices, and holes that serve as known hiding places (harborage) for pests, or permit ingress and egress of pests in the Pentagon Building.  All work shall be performed in a professional manner and the techniques used shall conform to standard industry practice.  DoD will be responsible for any work related to the building components such as structural members, furnishings, etc., affected by termite and carpenter ant management.  This will include the removing of damaged material and any associated repairs.



2.6.EMERGENCY SERVICE:  The Contractor shall provide emergency service on the day of request.  In the event that such requests cannot be completed within the established time frame, the Contractor shall immediately notify the COR or his Inspector and the respective Building Manager to indicate an anticipated completion date.  All such services shall be performed at no additional cost to the Government.

2.7.RELATED SERVICES:  DoD reserves the right to negotiate with the Contractor for related pest management services not specifically covered under this contract.  Additionally, entire or portions of buildings may be added or deleted, as necessary, from this contract.

2.8.ADDITIONAL SERVICES:  The Contractor shall clean accumulated amounts of bird guano from building surfaces and apply a suitable bird deterrent or repellent as requested by the COR.  The Contractor shall fully train all employees designated to perform such services in compliance with all applicable OSHA standards.  This service shall be performed with minimal disruption to the building occupants.  High-pressure washers producing pressures in excess of 1500 psi are not permitted.

2.9.REPORTING:  The Contractor shall submit monthly reports of all pest management activities.  This report shall summarize complaint call data, regular service activities and data, exterior surveys and services, and any additional services rendered, as well as make detailed, site-specific recommendations for corrective action.


3.SPECIFIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS-3.1.PERSONNEL:  The Contractor shall provide only qualified pest management personnel with adequate experience in the conduct of IPM programs and shall perform 100 percent of all the work with his/her own employees.  All on-site personnel must understand current practices in this field and be able to make judgments regarding IPM techniques.  Any substitutions, additions, or replacement of personnel from those cited in the Contractor?s original proposal, shall be submitted to the COR, for approval prior to their starting work under this contract.

A.The application of pesticides in any area shall not occur unless inspections or monitoring indicate the presence of pests in that specific area.  Pesticide applications shall target an identified and specific pest according to need and not by schedule.

B.Preventive treatments are forbidden except with prior approval through the COR and shall only be allowed in those areas where inspections indicate a potential insect or rodent infestation.

C.Unless prior approval is granted by the COR for unique situations where no alternative tactics are practical, space sprays of any sort (fogging, misting, ULV, etc.) shall be forbidden.  No space application of pesticide shall be made while tenant personnel are present.  No product identified as a fumigant shall be used in any DoD space for any purpose.

D.Unless prior approval is granted by the COR, spraying of insecticide on exposed surfaces shall be forbidden.  Insecticide sprays or dusts shall be restricted to crack and crevice applications only.

E.As directed by the COR, containerized and other types of bait formulations rather than sprays or aerosols shall be used for cockroach and ant control wherever appropriate.

F.As directed by the COR, trapping devices rather than sprays shall be used for indoor fly control whenever appropriate.

G.As directed by the COR, no rodenticide or tracking powders shall be used for rodent control inside DoD facilities.  On the outside grounds any rodenticides, regardless of packaging, shall be placed in accordance to the product label in locations not accessible to children, pets, wildlife, and domestic animals, or in EPA approved, tamper-resistant bait boxes.  Bait boxes shall be securely attached or anchored to the floor, ground, wall, etc. so that the boxes cannot be picked up or moved.  Rodenticides shall be secured in the baffle protected feeding chamber and never in the runway.  Bait boxes shall have their lids securely locked or fastened shut. 

Protective clothing, equipment, and devices shall, as a minimum, conform to Occupational Safety & Health Administration?s (OSHA) standards for the products being used.

3.4.EMPLOYEE CONDUCT:  All persons working under this contract shall be subject to such Government regulations as are applicable during the time spent on DoD property.  The Contracting Officer (CO) shall require the Contractor to dismiss from the work such employees as the CO deems incompetent, careless, insubordinate, or otherwise objectionable, or whose continued employment on the work is deemed by the CO to be contrary to the public interest, or inconsistent with the best interests of national security.

The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages to persons or property that occur as a result of negligence.

3.5.QUALITY CONTROL:  The Contractor shall be required to establish a complete quality control program to ensure compliance with the contract work requirements.  A critical aspect of this program is an inspection system that will enable the Contractor to evaluate contract performance and identify deficiencies in the quality of service before the level of performance become unacceptable.

The Contractor shall also be required to maintain a file of all inspections and any corrective action(s) taken.  This documentation shall be made available to the Government during the term of the contract, and until such time that final payment is made.

The Contractor shall discuss daily with the Inspector and/or the COR the scheduling and coordination of all monitoring, inspection and pest management work activity.

4.GOVERNMENT INSPECTION-Throughout the duration of this contract, DoD personnel will periodically inspect the premises covered by this contract to determine the effectiveness of the program and Contractor compliance with the contract.  The Contractor shall promptly initiate actions to correct all deficiencies found.

It shall be the Contractor?s responsibility to furnish an adequate supply of tools necessary for DoD personnel to inspect the interior of all rodent bait stations.  These tools may include Allen wrenches to loosen and retighten fasteners, keys to open locks, or replacement self-locking plastic ties.

Statement of Work
For
Contamination Avoidance Detector Test Suite (CADTS) of the 
Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT)


1.  SCOPE.  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the engineering design of a Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) for the test and evaluation (T&E) of emerging chemical/biological (CB) DoD detection systems.    

1.1 Background.  The CADTS project was initiated to rectify the current broad-based, short-term deficiencies that exist for testing DoD detector systems.  Much of the current DoD CB instrumentation and facilities can test only point and passive standoff detection systems; future DoD detection systems will use active standoff technology and require a new suite of instrumentation.  An active standoff facility is required for the evaluation of emerging CB Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) detection systems as well as Ultra Violet (UV) Laser- Induced Fluorescence (LIF) systems.

This effort will develop an engineering design with system specifications and conceptual drawings of a JABT that can generate a dynamic CB threat using realistic CB simulant challenges.  The JABT will evaluate active detector performance at standoff distances of 0.5 - 5.0 km. under dynamic conditions from 0 to 5-mph dynamic threat cloud conditions.

 System Requirements Document
For
Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT)


1.  SCOPE.  The System Requirements Document (SRD) defines the performance requirements for the Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT).

1.1 Systems Overview.  The JABT will be used to test and evaluate emerging Department of Defense (DoD) standoff detector systems, and to calibrate and validate range test equipment such as the referee Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)/Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems.  The JABT will be constructed at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT, and will use chemical and biological (CB) simulants only.  Logistics requirements should be considered in design of the JABT but no formal logistic plan is required for this design stage.

2.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.  This section does not apply since no documents are referenced in any Section of the SRD.

3.  REQUIREMENTS.

3.1 The JABT Requirements. 

    a.  The JABT shall generate and contain realistic CB simulant threats and challenge and evaluate active detector performance at standoff distances of 0.5 - 5.0 km.  

    b.  The JABT shall provide dynamic threat cloud conditions from 0.5 to 5.0 mph.  

    c.  The JABT shall provide: 
 
        (1) Means for transmission of the laser beam through either the end or sides of the tunnel so no optical disturbance will occur to either the incident beam or scattered light (i.e., be "invisible" to the LIDAR/LIF detector).

        (2) Unobstructed view of the CB cloud within the chamber.

        (3) Minimum backscatter and reflection from any instrument or chamber material (preferably two orders of magnitude less the intensity of the scattered light from the material under test).

        (4) Ability to disseminate chemical vapors/liquid aerosols/solid aerosols/particulates and biological liquid/solid aerosols.  The dissemination levels are illustrated in Table 3.1-1 (< 1 percent concentration change due to aerosol settling).
         
            Table 3.1-1 Range of Dissemination Requirements
Threat	Threshold	Objective
Vapor (mg/m3)	0.1 - 100	0.01 - 1000
Liquid  (micron)
Aerosol (particles/liter)	1 -500
500 - 10,000	1 - 1000
10 - 10,000
Particulate (micron)
Aerosol (particles/liter)	1 - 500
500 - 100,000	0.7 - 1000
10 - 1,000,000

        (5) Fully measure and characterize the threat cloud (edge, size, movement, position and concentration) as it moves dynamically down the tunnel; this data will be used to gage the performance of the detector under test (DUT).  

   (6) Generate a dynamic cloud within the tunnel for a simulant cloud residence time of at least 3 minutes at a velocity of 1 mph so the DUT can determine the edge, movement, position, and concentration of the cloud.

        (7) A design of the chamber and associated equipment that will be readily and easily decontaminated.

        (8) Means for minimizing leakage or release of the CB simulant materials into the atmosphere.

        (9) A designed JABT as to minimize the use of simulant during operation.  

    d.  The system shall have a life span of 10 years with an expected operational use of 1000 hours per year.

3.2 The JABT Desired.           

    a. It is also desirable that the JABT be enclosed inside an outer container to provide for year round operation.

    b.  It is desirable that the chamber has limited temperature-conditioning capability to allow for year-round operation in cold climates (no colder than 40 degrees F).

4.  VERIFICATION.  To be supplied by the contractor.

5.  PACKAGING.  Packaging requirements are specified in the contract.

<DESC>The U.S. House of Representatives is seeking comments from vendors on a "Draft" Statement of Work for a Communications Plan for the HR PayLinks Project.  The House is currently overhauling its Payroll and Benefits Management System.  Projectivity, Inc. is currently implementing Lawson Software's Human Capital Managment Suite.  As a result of this system overhaul, critical Human Resources processes (especially payroll and benefits management) will change, and automation will become available to assist in the completion of many now-manual processes.  The new system will be referred to as HR PayLinks and will offer employees and offices throughout the U.S. House of Representatives the opportunity to benefit directly from improved methods affecting delivery and receipt of Human Resources related services.  The success of HR PayLinks will require an organized and structured communications program to ensure that House stakeholders are part of, and embrace the process of change.  Changes brought about by HR PayLinks will be far reaching; therefore, a structured communications program is essential to build awareness, understanding and enthusiasm for this initiative by carefully articulating the benefits to be gained.

The House is seeking comments on a Draft Statement of Work and after receipt of vendor comments, a plan will be established to determine whether a Request for Proposal will be issued for potential contract award.  Interested parties are asked to refer to the website below to download the draft statement of work and provide comments.  http://www.house.gov/cao-opp/currentsol.htm

<DESC>DESC: Contracting Point of Contact: Rhoda Parker, Contract Specialist, 505- 853-7282; Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Earl Spillar 505-246-6740. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Contracting Directorate on behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE), Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) to Dr. David L. Fried for Atmospheric Compensation and Turbulence Analysis (ACTA) at the Starfire Optical Range. The contemplated effort is to obtain a three-year contract with an approximate value of $900,000. BACKGROUND: The Starfire Optical Range (SOR) Division along with the Advanced Optics and Imaging Division has engaged in the research and development of Atmospheric Compensation and Turbulence Analysis for the genesis of new concepts, the research of concepts through analysis and computer simulation by developing new algorithms, proposing approaches by which concepts could be evaluated and demonstrated experimentally, and plan further experiments in the areas of developing new theoretical models, development of new modes of operation of atmospheric compensation systems and components, modeling and/or simulating the consequences of these theoretical models and modes, proposing experiments to test these model and modes, and providing input to the ACTA team in evaluating and choosing between different analysis and approaches. Specific performance requirements are as follows:
1.	Develop and foster advanced concepts and technologies for real-time compensation of the effects of strong turbulence for imaging and laser beam propagation through turbulence that is distributed along all or most of the propagation path;
2.	Provide analysis for advanced concepts and technologies for real-time compensation of the effects of strong turbulence for imaging and laser beam propagation through vertical and slightly inclined turbulence profiles;
3.	Provide analysis for advanced concepts and techniques for specifying and measuring atmospheric turbulence;
4.	Provide analysis of the effects of strong scintillation on the performance of adaptive optics (AO) systems;
5.	Provide techniques for evaluating the performance of single conjugate and multi-conjugate AO systems in the presence of strong turbulence (phase and intensity fluctuations);
6.	Provide real-time, adaptive control schemes and algorithms which incorporate multiple measurements in space and time for optimal AO correction of strong turbulence;
7.	Provide techniques for improving real-time, high-bandwidth tracking of extended targets through strong atmospheric turbulence that is distributed along the entire propagation path;
8.	Provide techniques for determining anisoplanatic effects on laser beams projected from an AO system and propagated through atmospheric turbulence;
9.	Provide approaches for mitigating the effects of tilt anisoplanatism on AO system;
10.	Provide approaches for mitigating the effects of scintillation on AO reference beacons; 
11.	Provide analysis of systems using Rayleigh guide stars, sodium guide stars, and hybrids of both, and 
12.	Provide analysis of ground-based laser energy projection to air-based and space-based optical relay telescope systems.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking to procure load banks to be used to support the operation and maintenance of Department of Defense (DoD) Mobile Electric Power Plants (MEP's).  This requirement was synopsized 26 August 2002 under solicitation number WAS N68335-02-R-6055, and this procurement has a NEW number N68335-03-R-0009.  The MEP is a diesel engine driven generator set.  The MEP's will be used to provide power to support a Mobile Facility (MF) complex, a complex of habitable shelters in an austere expeditionary environment.  The load bank will be used to support the MEP operationally, and for maintenance of the MEP.  In operation the load bank will be used to provide and maintain a minimal level of loading on the MEP to alleviate the wet stacking commonly experienced on under loaded diesel engines.  In the maintenance role, the load bank will be used to perform load testing and periodic operational checks of MEP's. The load bank requirements are 200 kW at 120/208 or 240/416 VAC, 3 phase, 4-wire, and grounding at 50 or 60hz.  The Load Bank shall be capable of automatic load shedding, as well as manual operation, with the necessary controls.  The load bank shall have fault circuitry to protect equipment and personnel.  The load bank shall be transportable by rail, ship, truck, and internal airlift by various military aircraft. As necessary forklift pockets, lifting eyes, and tie down points should be provided to assure safe transport by all means listed. The load bank envelope should be no larger than l50"x 34" x 55", and should weigh no more than 700 lbs.
An Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package is required.  The government requires a commercial technical manual with illustrated parts breakdown (IPB), training materials, calibration procedures, and spare parts support.  A long-term warrantee is desirable.  We intend to procure two (2) First Article Test (FAT) units for functional testing by the government.  Delivery is required within 60 Days After Contract (DAC). The evaluation will last for a period of 90 days. Upon successful completion of functional testing we intend to exercise an option for thirty (30) production units at a rate of three units (3) per month to commence one-hundred-twenty (120) days after exercise of option.  Another option to procure an additional forty (40) units will be available.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government technical, past performance, and price considered.   The solicitation, with details of the technical proposals required to be submitted, will appear on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select "Business". Then "Doing Business with us" and "Open Solicitation." No solicitations will be mailed and no hard copies of solicitations will be made available. Responsible sources are advised to monitor the web site listed above for RFP release and RFP amendments, as necessary. The estimated release of the RFP is 12 Nov 2002, with a closing date of 12 Dec 2002. Phone, fax or e-mail requests for RFPs will not be accepted. The Government anticipates a firm fixed-price award as a result of this solicitation.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  This solicitation is being issued as 100% small business set-aside competition.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) is requesting industry information on general purpose processors for Naval and Marine Corps aircraft.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a request for Proposal or an indication that the Navy will contract for these supplies.  

" Military aircraft with legacy analog avionics started their transformation to digital functionality with the integration of GPS.  Now, to capture the various CNS/ATM functionalities, increased processing and display capability will be required.  These new CNS functionalities will require electronic displays, state of the art processing / software partitioning, and an input / output device available for aircrew control and display management.  A cost effective approach to this new capability for these aircraft should be available using NDI equipment and future software development efforts.  Information is requested regarding available processor, display and control hardware, various cockpit open architecture options, and the potential for third party software growth for future CNS and military functionality.  Future applications could include cockpit display of traffic information,  maps with digital terrain elevation data and graphic weather, both civil and military data link management with common software, and other data fusion and situational awareness processing requirements. "

The information obtained will be used to identify potential CCP sources  for use in the aircraft specified above.  Current Navy planning calls for cockpit processors to be available for procurement in FY05 to FY09 and beyond with installation beginning in FY06.

The date for the RFI submission has been extended until 11 December 2002.  The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND INDUSTRY DAY will be held on 11 December 2002.   The Navy will not pay for information received nor travel costs incurred in response to this RFI.  



All information received in response to this announcement will be kept confidential.  Address responses to:  Naval Air Systems Command, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Suite , Attn:  Stacy Bostjanick, Air-2.4.2.4.3, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547.  For any further information relating  to this RFI, please contact Ms. Stacy Bostjanick via e-mail at bostjanickss@navair.navy.mil

<DESC>NA Market Survey: Ka-BAND SATCOM ANTENNA SYSTEM FOR ON THE MOVE (OTM) OPERATION The US Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate is conducting this formal market survey to identify sources for a two-way (transmit and receive) Ka-band SatCom antenna system suitable for mobile opera tion.  The system may include an antenna that is steered electronically, mechanically, or via some hybrid solution set, along with the associated positioner/controller technology, sensor packages, radome, LNA and HPA.  We are interested in innovative solut ions for the objective force. The antenna is targeted for installation on a S832/A Standard Integrated Command Post System (SICPS) Rigid Wall Shelter (RWS) that will be transported and operated from an ECV-M113 vehicle.  The off-road vehicle dynamic conditions are described in Table 1 and environmental conditions in Table 2.    These are representative conditions and not firm requirements.   It is desired that the physical profile be kept as small as possible for covertness and transportability.  The antenna configuration may be removab le to satisfy this need. It is desired that the system provide for full azimuth coverage and elevation coverage.  It is required that the antenna acquire and remained locked on the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS) while providing a continuously usable signal when the ECV-M113 is  on the pause and move.  The antenna will operate over the Ka uplink range of 30-31GHz and downlink 20.2-21.2 GHz.  The antenna shall transmit in the right-hand (clockwise) circular polarization mode and receive in the left-hand (counter-clockwise) circula r polarization mode.  It is also desired that combinations of transmitting and receiving polarization be accomplished, but not simultaneously:  Transmit RH and Receive LH; Transmit LH and receive RH.  We are interested in what data rates the various antenn a solutions would support for both on the move (OTM) and on the pause operation.  Interested parties are to submit white papers that shall include, but are not limited to the following information:  link budget, performance data, configuration drawings or illustrations, mounting concept, discussion of design maturity and remaining devel opment, technical and schedule risk assessment, estimated development and unit costs. For link budgets submissions, calculations shall use the below Government Propagation model.

<DESC>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) and Fixed Submarine Broadcast System (FSBS) KG-3X CRYPTO MODERNIZATION.   The Strategic and Nuclear Deterrence Command and Control System Program Office (SND C2 SPO), Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, is requesting market research information from Industry for business approaches to assist in developing KG-3X Cryptologic Devices preliminary acquisition planning strategy. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal; a Request for Quotation; an Invitation for Bids; a solicitation; or an indication the Air Force SND C2 SPO will contract for items contained in the RFI. The SND C2 SPO will not pay respondents for information in response to this RFI. This constitutes the first step in an overall Crypto Modernization effort. The current modernization approach of the KG-3X family is to capitalize on the National Security Agency (NSA) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) crypto engine R&D efforts on the Programmable Embedded INFOSEC Product (PEIP) II, although use of other crypto devices may be considered. Modernization will be required for the following cryptologic devices: KG-33, KG-34, KGV-61, KGV-61A, KOV-17, and KOV-17-1. These systems are integrated into the following platforms: E-4B, E-6B, B-52, Minuteman Launch Control Centers, Navy SSN and SSBN submarines, submarine tenders, Navy shore broadcast stations, and all associated labs and trainers. Included in this survey is determination of potential sources to provide a study of: form factors, interfaces (to include electrical and mechanical characteristics, data, and format requirements) signal protocols, testing, and environmental requirements leading to development of a B-Specification for each KG-3X component (excluding the KOV-17 and KOV-17-1).  In addition, the study should include requirements for and impacts of creating a producible (i.e., manufacturable) design package (possibly in the form of "build-to-print" information). The Government encourages innovative acquisition approaches, to include spiral development; combined testing; teaming or partnering with industry or Government, including the Naval Research Lab; or use of other crypto devices. A classified SECRET/NOFORN, open session Industry Day will be held at the MITRE Corp, Bedford, MA, on November 19, 2002 to further discuss KG-3X Crypto Modernization requirements and solicit industry feedback for acquisition strategy development.  Private discussion sessions for the mutual exchange of information will be conducted with all interested parties on November 19 - 21, 2002. Companies requesting private discussions will be limited to 30 minutes per company. Due to space limitations, attendance at all Industry Day meetings is restricted to two representatives per company. To register for the Industry Day open session as well as to request private sessions, companies must submit attendee name, company name, company address, company telephone number and company E-mail address as well as security clearances, to include attendee's title, corporate affiliation, date and place of birth, current clearance (including COMSEC certification as applicable), and citizenship for each attendee to Mr. Steve Pestka, no later than November 15, 2002 at voice (781) 377-5219, fax (781) 377-8553, or email steven.pestka@hanscom.af.mil. Specific location, schedules and additional information will be posted on the Hanscom AFB Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) web site (http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil). Additionally, ten days after Industry Day vendors may be requested to submit a five - page white paper describing their recommended execution approach (including schedule). Specific details of the white paper will also be included on HERBB prior to Industry Day. All small business and disadvantaged sources should identify themselves as such. Interested offerors shall also identify any known or potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) that may arise during this acquisition and state what plans are in effect to mitigate this conflict. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. A contract will not be awarded as a result of this announcement.  For technical questions concerning this effort contact the KG-3X Modernization Program Manager, Capt Steven Lang, ESC/NDMS, Hanscom AFB MA, commercial (781) 377-8974, fax (781) 377-8553, Steven.Lang@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking information from any commercial source capable of providing a high mobility weapons platform. The vehicle must operate on diesel fuel, be able to carry the M-2 .50 cal,  the MK-19 40 mm, or the M240G medium machine gun, and be internally transportable in MV-22 aircraft. Firms able to meet this requirement are invited to submit a statement of capabilities and product literature to include current GSA information (if applicable) and price schedules or cost estimates.  A cornerstone of Operational Maneuver From the Sea (OMFTS) is the insertion of vertical assault elements against deep inland objectives with the MV-22.  The infantry units comprising the vertical assault element must employ their medium and heavy machine guns and automatic grenade launchers immediately after landing.  These weapons systems are too heavy to be man-packed except over very short distances.  Consequently, there is an operational requirement for a vehicle, internally transportable in the MV-22, to carry these weapons.  Special operations forces, Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)s), and reconnaissance units, inserted by MV/CV-22s, will also need mobility assets to support a wide variety of missions.

To address this operational requirement, the ITV program was initiated in 1999 as a joint program with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The ITV requirement, as described in the Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD), is for a light tactical vehicle small enough to fit inside the MV-22.  The initial acquisition strategy for the ITV focused on Non Developmental Item (NDI) alternatives. In 2000, the Marine Corps selected two commercial vehicles as candidates for the ITV. During assessments of these candidate vehicles in the summer of 2001, the vehicles generally met the operational requirement.  However, their operational suitability was marginal with respect to loading in and unloading from the MV-22.  In view of these results and with the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the Osprey postponed, the planned NDI procurement was cancelled in March 2002.  The ITV program office is currently conducting a requirements review of the JORD, as well as studies, to identify potential cost, risk, schedule, and performance tradeoffs.  The only performance parameters not subject to tradeoff are the ability to transport the vehicle internally in the MV-22 and the requirement to operate the vehicle on diesel fuel.  This RFI for the ITV has been released to assist in this process by identifying Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) /NDI alternatives that can satisfy key elements of the operational requirement.  The program office anticipates that industry responses will range from all terrain/light utility vehicles to sports utility vehicles to 4 wheel drive pickup trucks to existing military tactical vehicles.  

Initially, the Marine Corps used the M-151 jeep as a fast attack vehicle to satisfy the MEU(SOC) requirement for a weapons platform capable of internal transport by helicopter.  The Marine Corps has replaced these obsolete M-151s with an interim fast attack vehicle (IFAV).  On 18 September 2002, the Marine Corps released a request for information/sources sought to identify commercial sources for a Helicopter-Transportable Tactical Vehicle (HTTV) capable of serving as a mobility platform to conduct long-distance reconnaissance patrols.  The HTTV must be internally transportable in CH-53 aircraft and operate on diesel fuel.  The primary distinction between the HTTV RFI and this ITV RFI is the requirement for CH-53 internal transportability vice the requirement for MV-22 internal transportability.

<SUBJECT>--RUBBER FLUIDIZING BED -- PRESOLICITITATION CONFERENCE -18 NOV 02
<DESC>NA Red River Army Depot has a requirement for a rubber fluidizing bed.  The Depot anticipates issuing a solicitation for the bed.  A draft set of specifications has been developed.  The Depot will host a pre-solicitation conference on 18 November 2002at 10:30  AM in Building 431, Contracting Conference Room, Red River Army Depot , Texarkana, TX.  The purpose of the pre-solicitation conference is to allow industry to comment and propose changes to the draft specifications prior to the issuance of a solicitation.   System overview:  The desired system shall use the principle of pyrolysis to remove vulcanized rubber from steel and aluminum materials.  Track shoes and roadwheels are submerged in a high temperature fluidized bed of sand where the rubber materials are gasified.  These gases are then removed from the bed and passed through an afterburner operated at very high temperatures to insure complete burning of any partially oxidized and unoxidized compounds in the gas stream.  The post afterburner combusted gases  are then cooled and processed by ventilation and pollution abatement equipment.  The basket of processed parts is then transported to a water quench tank where the parts are cooled prior to unloading.  Integral to the system is the ability to maintain the  T-4 temper rating of 2024 series aluminum roadwheels.  The system shall be comprised of two separate denuding lines; each capable of processing a minimum of 200 pounds of rubber material per 1.25 hours at a maximum basket live workload weight of 3,200 pou nds.  The workbaskets presently used by RRAD weigh approximately 3,500 pounds giving a total load of approximately 6,700 pounds.  Each fluidizing bed line shall be designed and constructed for independent operation to ensure production redundancy for emerg ency repair and single side shutdown for periodic maintenance. Each denuding line shall be capable of operating on a schedule of 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week, fifty-two weeks per year.  The draft specifications will be posted on the Red River Army Depot Procnet website;   https://www.redriver.army.mil/contracting/solicitations/draft_fluidized_bed/.  Firms interested in participating in the conference are encouraged to email their questions to the Contracting Officer in advance of the meeting. Firms interested in attending the pre-solicitation conference must contact the Mr. Don Kennedy, Contracting Officer, email dkennedy@redriver-ex.army.mil , (903) 334-2541 or William Bono, wbono@redriver-ex.army.mil , (903) 334-4752 to arrange access to the Depot.

BACKGROUND: The USDA Forest Service Cooperative Fire Prevention Program is a comprehensive information and education awareness program that uses Smokey Bear as the vehicle for forest fire prevention messages. The program uses a variety of techniques and approaches to stimulate active support and cooperation with other public agencies, educators, business industry and organizations in working to prevent human caused wildfires.  Smokey Bear and prevention messages were introduced in 1944. By the 1950s, the icon and message were successful enough to warrant being protected by Federal law. The Smokey Bear Act. PL 82-359 and amended PL 93-318 were passed to provide protection for his image and use and allow for the collection of royalties. The law authorized the commercial use of Smokey Bear with permission of the USDA Forest Service, in consultation with the Ad Council and the National Association of State Foresters. It permitted the secretary of Agriculture to license the use of Smokey Bear and collect royalties and secure them in a fund to be used only for the prevention of forest fires. That authority has been delegated to the Forest Service.  
The current licensing program was established in 1952. A licensing contractor has managed the vendor licensing for the last ten years. Currently (2002) the program has 49 licensed vendors.  This program has roughly maintained this number since 1997. The annual royalties are approximately $100,000. SCOPE OF REQUIREMENTS: The purpose of commercial licensing of Smokey Bear and his message is to increase awareness of human caused fires through message exposure and to generate royalties for fire prevention program initiatives. However, commercial licensing ventures must retain the original purpose of the symbol and his current message ?Only You Can Prevent Wildfires.? The Image and appearance of all licensee products must meet established guidelines and standards for quality control. This includes review and approval of all artwork, costume, association, context and presentation of the trademark symbol by the USDA Forest Service in consultation with the National Association of State Foresters and the Ad Council. Final approval of all proposals, products and licensing is the responsibility of the USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management, Fire Prevention Officer.
Specific information on established guidelines is referenced in FSH 5109.18 Wildland Fire Prevention Handbook. Chapter 20 Smokey Bear Program and The Smokey Bear Style Guide located on smokeybear.com. Background on the Smokey Bear fire prevention campaigns can also be found on the web site smokeybear.com
