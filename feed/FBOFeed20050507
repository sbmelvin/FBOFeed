It is the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.

The NAICS code is 541611 and the Small Business Standard is $6 Million. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing Resident Satisfaction Surveys for Navy Housing and related services in accordance with the Performance Based Statement of Work (PBSOW).  The proposed contract will be for a base year and 4 one-year options. Each year requires separate pricing.  The proposed contract type is a firm fixed price. The following clauses apply and are hereby incorporated by reference or full text as appropriate: 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS: (a) NAICS code included herein; (b)(4) Offeror proposals:  Contractor shall submit the following information (1) Completed Schedule Of Supplies/Services (2) Technical Proposal (3) Past Performance Data; (4) Representations and Certifications. (11) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration (c) Period for acceptance of offers: Delete 30 calendar days and insert 60 calendar days  ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:  Proposals must be legible and the line spacing shall be double spaced, typewritten (on one side only), in a type size not smaller than twelve (12) point proportional, on paper not larger than eight and a half by eleven inches.  A page limit of 25 pages applies to the Technical Proposal and Past Performance Data. Attachments are to be limited to supporting data necessary to validate/verify proposal information.  Charts or diagrams may be used within the page limitations. All charts or diagrams that exceed 8 ½ x 11 must be provided in foldout format, so they measure 8 ½ X 11 prior to unfolding.  The government must be able to evaluate all charts or diagrams without removal from the binder. Tables, charts, and graphic depictions may be single spaced but limited to data and reference material presentation only, not textual explanations. All pages shall be numbered sequentially.  Pages in excess of the limitation shall not be read, and the proposal shall!  be evaluated as if the excess pages did not exist. 52-212-2, EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS, paragraph (a) is completed as follows:   Factor 1, CAPABILITY TO PERFORM will be determined in accordance with the following evaluation factors and sub-factors.  To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must describe its capability and experience in each of the areas covered by the four sub-factors.  To be determined “technically capable of performing,” the Government must rate the Offeror technically acceptable in each of the following four sub-factors. Each sub-factor is weighted equally.   1.	Sub-factor 1 - The Offeror shall must demonstrate it has a strong background in real estate and property management.  2.	Sub-factor 2 - The Offeor must demonstrate it has experience surveying Navy and private sector housing. 3.	Subfactor 3- The Offeor demonstrate that it is able to provide trending statistical analysis that compares and contrasts data for military and private sector housing and public private venture housing (PPV). 4.	Sub-factor 4 - The contractor must demonstrate it has benchmarking capabilities and technology to compare Navy family and bachelor housing survey results against the best firms in the industry. Factor 2, Past Performance as demonstrated by minimum of three recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar services (Offeror to include contract numbers, period of performance, dollar value, General description of the contract, including aspects of the contract the offeror deems relevant to this effort, points of contact, telephone numbers and other relevant information, e.g. awards). Each contract shall have been performed during the past 3 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Factor 3, Price  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (1) will be further evaluated under Factors (2) and (3).  In order to be considered technically acceptable under Factor 1, the Offeror must be rated as technical acceptable in each of the four capability sub-factors.   In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (1) to be technically acceptable, Factor (2) Past Performance, is significantly more important than Factor (3), Price.  Offeror's past performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance and discriminate among offerors.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory, highly satisfactory and exceptional performance and achievements.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as other sources. Offers without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Government reserves the right to pay a reasonable cost premium for a higher quality rating for past performance, which represents a lower performance risk to the Government AWARD INFORMATION ADDENDUM to Provision AR 52.212-2 (a) One award will be made for all line items.  Any offeror that does not propose on all line items, to include all options, will not be considered for award.  The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The resulting award will be issued as a bi-lateral contract using a SF 1449. Contractor.

The labor categories given do not allow for us to manage and therefore be responsible for anything.   The SOW would like us to bring project management philosophy and skills and experience, but the labor categories dictated do not seem to allow this. Response:  The changes in Amendment 0004 should allow Offerors to address this.  Contractor is expected to manage its staff. 55.	Submitted Question:  When will all questions be answered?

Can our staff work from their homes under these types of circumstances? 	Response:  Offers need to determine their own solutions for the circumstance. 58.  	Submitted Question:  Are these services for COTS financial software applications?  If yes, what is the application? 	Response:  Yes, Oracle Federal Financials. 59.	Submitted Question:  Where do I find the description of the labor category skills required? 	Response:  See Amendment 004 SOW 60.  	Submitted Question:  Once you have the rates, what are the steps in the proposal process to fulfill the individual tasks? 	Response:  We will negotiate task orders based on these rates with the contractor.

<DESC>Westat, serving as the NINDS Pilot Therapeutics Network (NPTUNE) Clinical Operations Center under contract number N01-NS-4-2361 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, is seeking qualified investigators and trial sites to conduct the first NPTUNE protocol - a Phase 1 dose-finding, pharmacokinetic study of phenylbutyrate in children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).

Site selection for NPTUNE’s SMA study will be a two-step process.  (1) Interested investigators will first submit a statement of capability in response to this announcement.  (2) Those sites whose capabilities are determined to be satisfactory will be invited to respond to a Request for Proposal.  The most suitable proposals will be selected for contract negotiation and participation in the SMA study and will join the NPTUNE network.

To be considered for participation in the SMA study as an investigational trial site, investigators must submit a statement of capability that demonstrates: (1) prior experience in conducting clinical research studies; (2) adequate personnel, research infrastructure, and laboratory facilities to conduct clinical trials; (3) an Institutional Review Board (IRB) with current Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) on file with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP); (4) facility location within the United States or Canada; (5) accessibility to and experience in treating infants and children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Instructions and evaluation criteria for the five-page capability statements are provided herein. 

Westat anticipates awarding up to ten (10) Fixed-Priced subcontracts.  The performance period is projected to commence in October 2005 and take up to two (2) years to complete. 

BRIEF BACKGROUND 

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is establishing the NINDS Pilot Therapeutic Trials Network (NPTUNE) to facilitate the rapid conduct of high quality clinical trials and research through the provision of infrastructure for the design and implementation of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in a timely and efficient manner.  Westat, a contract research organization located in Rockville, Maryland, is under contract with the NINDS to serve as the Clinical Operations Center (COC) for NPTUNE.  
The objectives of the NPTUNE network are twofold:

1.	To facilitate the early clinical testing of promising compounds for different neurological diseases.  The focus will be on the timely translation of preclinical results into clinical studies and the efficient conduct of these clinical studies.  Pilot clinical trials are studies required to gather the information needed to conduct a definitive efficacy study and fulfill the relevant regulatory requirements.  Thus the term pilot clinical trial includes phase I and II studies.  The interventions studied may be new compounds or compounds that are already FDA approved for other indications.  Pilot trials include but are not limited to:
a)	Studies to refine the intervention strategy – dosage, duration, delivery system, pharmacokinetics and dynamics;
b)	Studies to define and refine the target population; and
c)	Collection of preliminary data for establishing measures of efficacy and safety.

2.	To build and operate a network that will serve multiple different neurological diseases through shared resources and facilitate the study of rare neurological diseases by reaching out to a large number of sites serving different patient populations.  
To be considered for participation as an investigational trial site for this protocol, investigators must demonstrate: 
1)	Prior experience in conducting clinical research studies; 
2)	Adequate personnel and facilities necessary to conduct clinical trials;
3)	Institutional Review Board (IRB) with current Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) on file with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP); 
4)	Facility location within the United States or Canada; and
5)	Accessibility to and experience in treating infants and children with SMA.
Applicant institutions are requested to complete and submit a Capability Statement form included with this RFC and return it to the address listed on the form.  Capability Statements are due no later than 5:00 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on May 27, 2005.  Capability Statements must be received by the due date to allow adequate time for staff preparation and for the objective review process.  Please carefully follow the instructions below, and make sure the Capability Statement is easy to read.  The text of the Capability Statement should be no longer than five (5) pages in length (one-and-a-half line spacing and an 11-point font).  Appendices with additional background information may be included and do not count as part of the 5-page limit.

A Capability Statement received after the due date may be considered at Westat’s discretion.
1.	NPTUNE INVESTIGATIVE SITE CAPABILITY STATEMENT FORM (format)
