This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Newport Corporation (New Focus Division) in Santa Clara, CA for the purchase of a Velocity tunable external cavity diode laser to be used in ongoing experiments such as transmission/reflection spectroscopy of nanophotonics devices and resonant optical pumping of nanocavity-based light emitters at room and cryogenic temperatures. For each of the different types of experiments, a large amount of customized control software has already been written for use with three existing Velocity tunable lasers in the lab manufactured by Newport/New Focus. <br /><br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br /><br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or <br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C.2304(d)(1)(B) or U.S.C.253(d)(1)(B).<br />Sole source determination is based on the need for direct drop-in replacements for the existing experimental system, which must be mechanically, optically and electrically compatible with the remaining system that shall not be modified.
<p>Substitution with components from another vendor will require the creation of new software and would cause a significant delay in the initiation of important experimental ongoing projects that further the mission of developing new measurement tools to help enable the use of nanotechnology in areas such as future electronics. Newport Corporation/New Focus is the only known vendor capable of providing the necessary equipment that shall allow for direct drop in replacements and consistent real time data from the current system.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 10 weeks after receipt of an order.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>

<DESC><p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to award a small business set-aside contract for support services in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation for the Experimental Investigations on Reactor Containment Thermal-Hydraulics and Severe Accident Management (ERCOSAM) Project.</p>
<p>The purpose of ERCOSAM is to establish a containment mixing data base for a test sequence representative of a severe accident in a light water reactor. The project focuses on stratification, mixing, and condensation phenomena as well as the operation of mitigation systems such as sprays, coolers, and PARs. The NRC is interested in predicting the distribution and stratification of the hydrogen within the containment as well as the effectiveness of accident management systems such as containment sprays, coolers, and passive auto-catalytic re-combiners (PARs). The purpose of this research is for the development of analytical tools including CFD for an improved assessment of these phenomena along with a set of best practice guidelines for the application of CFD for containment analysis.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to complete pre-test and post-test predictions using the FLUENT CFD code for tests different facilities. The pre-test predictions will be supplied to the ERCOSAM project to help with test planning and preparation. Post-test predictions will be completed on all of the test sequences. User-defined functions for the FLUENT CFD code will be developed and validated for each specific test. The user-defined functions are needed to account for significant containment phenomena related to these scenarios that may not be included in the FLUENT code. These phenomena could include but are not limited to behavior of the containment sprays, containment cooling system, PARs, and/or the effects of wall condensation.</p>
<p>The intended award date of this contract is April 2, 2012.</p>

The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br><br>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br><br>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br><br>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br><br>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br><br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the  <br>U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br><br>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br><br><br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list.

Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: <br><br>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for a Gas Filter. The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<br><br>1. Description:<br><br>The M18A1 Gas Filter removes toxic chemical agents in vapor or gaseous forms. Used in conjunction with the M19 HEPA (particulate) filter and M1A1-19 blower system (M13A1), this filter canister is an ideal choice for meeting collective protection or individual distribution needs.  This filter is commonly used as part of the M13A1 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) and can be found in virtually all classes of combat and tactical vehicles.  The M18A1 gas filter utilizes ASZM-TEDA activated carbon to remove gaseous toxic agents from the air.<br><br>2. Mission:<br><br>The M18A1 Gas Filter provides 10 CFM (cubic feet per minute) of clean air in a large vehicle for protection against warfare agents. <br><br>3. Users:  Department of Defense<br><br>4. Capabilities:<br><br>* Removes chemical and biological agents from up to 10 CFM (cubic feet per minute) of air flowing through the specific system.<br>* Uses ASZM-TEDA carbon that can be disposed of as non-hazardous waste, reduces potential health hazards to the end user if the filter is ruptured and carbon is released. <br>* Effective filtration at temperatures ranging from -60 F to + 160 F. <br>* Five-year shelf life.<br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE: <br><br>1.

In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br><br>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br><br>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br><br>5.   In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br><br>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br><br><br><br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: <br><br>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for an M2A2 GPFU and M1A1-19 Precleaner and Particulate Filter.  The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<br><br>1. Description: M2A2 Air Purifier<br><br>The M2A2 Air Purifier is a two-part GPFU.  The unit consists of three major subsystems; a motor blower (centrifugal fan) with adjustable orifice (iris) valve; a carbon filter for gases and a high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter of pleated paper design. The filters remove chemical or biological warfare agents from the air stream passing through the M2A2 Air Purifier before being distributed via corrugated wall hoses to users. The M2A2 Air Purifier provides clean air to the masks of the crew in combat vehicles, to include M1A1 Series Tanks and similar vehicles.<br> <br>Note: The carbon and HEPA filters could potentially be obtained through a subcontract to a future requirement.<br><br>2. Mission:<br><br>The M2A2 Air Purifier provides clean respirator air to each member of the combat vehicle crew, protecting against chemical/biological warfare agents and radiological particles.<br> <br>3. Users:  Department of Defense<br><br>4. Capabilities:<br><br>* Removes chemical and biological agents from up to 20 CFM of air flowing through the specific system.<br>* Uses ASZM-TEDA carbon that can be disposed of as non-hazardous waste, reduces potential health hazards to the end user if the filter is ruptured and carbon is released. <br>* Filter components and media materials are resistant to fungus and mildew.<br>* Effective filtration at temperatures ranging from -60 F to + 160 F.<br><br>5. Description: M1A1-19 Precleaner and Particulate Filter<br><br>The M1A1-19, contains the blower, dust separator and particulate filter.  The M1A1-19 delivers up to 20 CFM and consists of a manifold assembly, particulate filter, housing and precleaner assembly, and a spring clip.<br><br>Note: The particulate filter could potentially be obtained through a subcontract to a future requirement.<br><br>6. Mission:<br><br>Removes toxic chemical and biological agents from contaminated air and supplies purified air as part of gas-particulate filter unit systems.  These systems are installed in various military vehicles to provide air directly to users through their M42A2 mask or headpiece.<br><br>7. Users:  Department of Defense<br><br>8. Capabilities:<br><br>Contaminated air is pulled into the M1A1-19 unit and passes through an M19 particulate filter. The M19 removes toxic particles and aerosols at an efficiency rate of 99.97% at 0.3 microns.<br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE: <br><br>1.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Semiconductor Device Characterization and Analysis System (System) which is required in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab for parametric test and device characterization in a multi-user environment. The diversity of tests needed to support user requirements, as well as equipment qualification, demands a tool that can provide a broad range of test and measurement capability in a single integrated solution. Users perform a wide range of electrical characterization tests including but not limited to capacitance/voltage (CV Sweep or C-t sampling), current/voltage (IV Staircase or Multi-channel Sweep), multi-frequency capacitance/voltage (C-f Sweep), and pulse testing (Pulsed sweep or Staircase sweep with pulsed bias) of devices with between 2 and 5 connections. The System will interface with an existing manual probe station using non-kelvin triax connections. To facilitate ease of use for the majority of measurement requirements, the System must contain an integrated low noise matrix switch giving users the flexibility to select the source and probe configuration in the System software without the need to change cables. Measurements will be made on semiconductor wafers and may require front side only connections or front and backside (through a low noise chuck) connections. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the Semiconductor Device Characterization and Analysis System that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>NIST has a need for a Semiconductor Device Characterization and Analysis System that would meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Shall include four (4) High Resolution source measurement units with the following capability:</p>
<p>&bull; Source Maximum: +/-100V, +/-0.1A <br />&bull; Measurement Resolution: 0.5uV, 1fA<br />&bull; Triax cable connection</p>
<p>&bull; Shall include two (2) High Power source measurement units with the following capability:</p>
<p>&bull; Source Maximum: +/-200V, +/-1A<br />&bull; Measurement Resolution: 2uV, 10fA <br />&bull; Triax cable connection</p>
<p>&bull; Shall iinclude one (1) Multi-Frequency Capacitance Measurement Unit with the following capability:<br /><br />&bull; Measurement Frequencies between 1kHz and 5MHz<br />&bull; Output signal: 10mV to 250mV<br />&bull; DC Bias: +/-25V Internal, +/-100V with external SMU connection<br />&bull; BNC cable connection<br />&bull; Shall include one (1) High Voltage Pulse Generator Unit with the following capability:</p>
<p>&bull; Two output channels<br />&bull; Output voltage range: +/-20V<br />&bull; Pulse Period: 30nSec to 10 Sec<br />&bull; Pulse Width: 10nSec to 10 Sec<br />&bull; SMA cable connections<br /><br />&bull; Shall include one (1) Low Noise Multi-Channel Switch Matrix with the following capability:</p>

<DESC>TITLE:  Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) Recon and Attack Concurrency Upgrade.<br><br>BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  AVCATT is a virtual simulation training system.  In a stand-alone configuration or networked with multiple virtual and constructive simulation systems, (e.g., Close Combat Tactical Trainer- CCTT, Virtual Battlespace 2- VBS2, Call for Fire Trainer- (CFFT) it provides the capability for aviation units to train and sustain performance of the critical collective tasks that support the battlefield functional areas of maneuver, maneuver support, and maneuver sustainment and their associated Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) of intelligence, Fire Support (FS), air defense, mobility/counter mobility/survivability, combat service support, and command and control.<br><br>PEO STRI Product Manager for Air and Command Tactical Trainers (PM ACTT), Assistant Product Manager (APM) AVCATT has a requirement for maintaining concurrency for the Recon and Attack components of the AVCATT system.   This includes upgrading the current Apache (AH-64D) Block II Lot 10 to AH-64D Block II Lot 13.1 as the base effort.  <br><br>Options for future efforts may include the following:<br><br>1.	Apache AH-64D Block III Capability<br>2.	Kiowa OH-58D & OH-58F Capabilities<br>3.	Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) integration into AVCATT <br><br>INTENT OF THIS RFI:  To collect responses from interested offerors to provide concurrency capabilities enhancements to the AVCATT system.  Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research only.  The Government requests that all interested parties submit a response (not to exceed 25 pages) that provides a description of your capabilities, past experience in similar efforts, a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the base effort only and a description of how you would approach each section of the effort.  An Industry Day has currently not been scheduled for this effort, however, it is anticipated that interested parties will be permitted to tour the AVCATT system at a later date, to be determined.<br> <br>ACQUISITION APPROACH: The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the AVCATT Recon and Attack Concurrency Upgrade.  It is anticipated that the requirements will be fulfilled via delivery orders under a single source IDIQ contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  The contract type for this effort has not yet been determined.  Issues to be considered in the acquisition strategy for this effort include the following:<br><br> 	The AVCATT program has various pieces of software that are proprietary these are listed in the supplemental data.  Successful bidders will need to provide details on how their solution will address these. <br><br> 	The AVCATT program has identified the quantities for the base effort to include the entire AVCATT fleet of 144 manned modules. <br><br> 	The Government's belief (based on previous efforts conducted over the past years of the program) is that the AVCATT upgrade capabilities are better satisfied and accomplished under one contractual vehicle.  The complexity of the System architecture and the correlation of the platforms with one another cannot be split amongst Contractors. <br><br> 	A multi-platform collective environment is the primary purpose of the AVCATT and it must be the responsibility of one Contractor alone.  Cost increases as the Government is required to fund multiple Contractors to work on the different platforms while funding the integration of the separately developed platforms. <br><br>QUANTITIES:<br><br>	AH-64D Block II Lot 13.1- hardware and software, 144 manned modules<br>	AH-64D Block III- software only<br>	OH-58D- software only<br>	OH-58F- hardware and software, 102 manned modules<br>	Weapons- software only<br>	UAS- software only<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  TBD<br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED: Firms interested in this potential procurement must provide their capability statement via email no later than 3:30pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 24 February 2012 to Lauren Bushika, Contract Specialist, lauren.bushika@us.army.mil.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a market survey.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  <br><br>The purpose of this market survey is to determine the business size and capabilities of potential interested firms. relative to the North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) 541330, "Engineering Services". The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is $4.5M average annual revenue.  To make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project, the Government may use responses to this market survey. The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement may depend on the responses to this market survey.<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District is performing a market survey for an architect-engineer requirement entitled:  "Echo Pier Replacement, U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll". This requirement may be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract.  The magnitude of the construction for this project is estimated to be between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000. <br><br><br>Project Description  <br>Echo Pier Restoration, Kwajalein Atoll<br><br>This project will consist of the following: repairing and renovating the existing Echo Pier (including Charlie, Delta and Echo berths) by encapsulating the footprint of the pier with new steel sheet piling and filling the area within the sheet piling with suitable compacted structural fill material and installation of new concrete decking. Splash zone areas of the new steel wall will be encapsulated with a reinforced concrete cap; Repair the existing Bravo and Foxtrot berth portions of Echo Pier by installing new anchor rods to the existing sheet piles, repairing the existing concrete sheet pile caps, repair and re-compact the existing fill and install new concrete decking. Provide marine fenders, bollards and chocks. Supporting facilities include replacement of the existing utility systems supporting the pier (electric, potable water, non-potable water, fire water, sanitary sewer service, lighting, and communications) and install new utility connections appropriate to each berthing location. Demolition and reconstruction of an existing stevedore storage facility with integrated latrines and utility vault. The existing tide gauge building will also be relocated.  Design considerations will also include all restrictions and recommendations provided in an environmental assessment that is targeted for completion by March 2013. <br><br>Background:<br>The existing Echo pier at U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) was originally constructed in the early 1940's by the Japanese Imperial Navy during World War II. The present configuration of the pier is the result of a series of alteration and repair projects completed from WWII to the present. These alterations and repairs were accomplished in piecemeal fashion and as a result, different areas of the pier have various as-built conditions and load carrying capacities. In addition, the severe corrosive environmental conditions prevalent at Kwajalein have severely deteriorated the structural components of the pier and further reduced load carrying capacities.  Underwater inspections have identified several areas of the pile supported pier in "failing" or "poor" condition, especially in areas supported by heavily corroded steel H-piles. No vehicular traffic is allowed on Echo Pier at several locations. This severely limits the capacity of the pier to support mission critical operations.<br><br>Design Requirements:<br>- This is a design-bid-build requirement.<br><br>- An Environmental Assessment, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and the USAKA Environmental Standards (UES) must be prepared for the project, and a Document of Environmental Protection (DEP) will also be required. Environmental compliances including, but not limited to, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, applicable Executive Orders, etc., will also be met. The Environmental Assessment is scheduled to be completed by Jan 2015.<br><br>- Design criteria will include, but is not limited to, the following:<br>a.

Notice of Intent to award sole source contract.  This is not a solicitation.  The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Haven, Connecticut (NCO 1 Contracting 90C) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order for laboratory instrumentation and related software know as a dynamic clamp system  to Cambridge Electronic Design, Limited, Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, England CB4 OFE.   The authority for this action is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice contains information current through FAC 2005-55.  The NAICS is 423440.  The PSC is AN15.  No solicitation will be posted to this site.   Interested persons may contact the Contract Specialist regarding this procurement and may identify capabilities for items of this kind.  Contract Specialist: Cheri K. Wicks, cheri.wicks@va.gov.  Email only, no phone calls accepted.  A decision not to compete this requirement is based upon this notice, the responses to this notice and the Justification and Approval.  All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (www.ccr.gov).  Contractors should complete On-Line Representations and Certifications (https://orca.bpn.gov/).   Consult your State Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for technical assistance with these requirements. 
The salient characteristics are as follows:
Dynamic-clamp system should be compatible with the patch-clamp amplifier in Dr. Waxman's laboratory with no special hardware required. Should be able to apply Hodgkin/Huxley (standard or Alpha/Beta), single exponential, exponential difference, Chemical synapse, Electrical synapse and Leak models. Should be able to execute multiple (up to 8 models) to generate outputs on multiple (up to 8 DACs); multiple models driving one DAC are automatically summed.
It has been shown by simulations and experiment that the performance of dynamic clamp systems is strongly affected by the update rate and latency of updates. The high speed methods are important to provide extremely high rates of update with low latencies, to allow undertake experiments. The mechanism must incorporate a hardware based overflow detector so that one can be sure that the required update rates have been achieved and that your data is trustworthy. Thus dynamic clamp should have fast update rates: 100 kHz with one Hodgkin/Huxley model, 60 kHz with 4 models and 30 kHz with 15 models. Dynamic clamp should have detection of overload in hardware to give confidence in results.
Also the system should have: ergonomic dialogs make to easy view and edit the model parameters with ability to modify model parameters and apply changes while sampling; automatic switching between multiple parameter states during sampling; pulse and waveform outputs defined by the user can be summed into the outputs generated by dynamic clamping; output sequencer can enable and disable individual models dynamically during a single sampling sweep.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate (WARSTAR) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: GENERAL DYNAMICS LAND SYSTEMS INC., 38500 MOUND ROAD, STERLING HEIGHTS, MI 48310-3200.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <br><br>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>2) Brief description of supplies or services required and the intended use: <br><br>Ballistic protective small arms protective samples for test and evaluation, proprietary to General Dynamics Land Systems<br><br>3) Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used: <br><br>These samples are based on a proprietary design to General Dynamics Land systems. It is a design that has been evaluated for higher level threats and the requested samples are being scaled down to personnel armor. No other Company has this unique design which has potential to reduce the weight of personnel armor significantly.<br><br>4) Reason that suggested source is the only source which can provide the supplies or services: <br><br>The suggested source is the only source because this is the only system that fills our needs and is compatible with our current systems. We can also use the software we currently have with our existing system for our new system. We have already obtained licensing information to verify that the software can be used.<br><br>5) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  <br><br>As a part of the NSRDEC program in ballistic, market research is done continually usually<br>through meetings with companies or request for information from companies.  This technology has potential to make a significant weight reduction for personnel armor and evaluations need to be completed before any additional research funds are directed toward further development. No other company can build samples representing GDLS' concept. The purchase of these test samples will aid the decision to request a concept paper under NSRDEC's BAA<br>	 <br>6) Explain why an adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by full and open competition has not been developed or are not available: <br><br>See above information.<br><br>7) Provide a statement of the actions, if any, the government may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before future acquisitions are required.  If this is a follow-on action to a previously competed action, so state:<br><br>Continuous monitoring of the industrial base will be performed to take advantage of the competitive forces in the marketplace. NSRDEC will continue to survey the material/systems that are under development and will support other research to drive competition.<br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond VIA EMAIL to this requirement to the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division no later than 8:00 a.m. on  February 9, 2012.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7110-00-NIB-0065	<br />Name:		Office Chair, Managerial Mid-Back Task, Black<br />Description:	Managerial mid-back task chair, seat upholstered in black 100% polyester fabric, back upholstered in black mesh, 360 degree swivel, 2:1 Synchro dual-action tilt mechanism, tilt tension control and tilt lock, adjustable lumbar support of 2.5", height adjustable ratchet back of 2.5", height (3"), width (2.5") and depth (2") adjustable T-Arm rests, black frame and polished aluminum base.

Overall dimensions 21.5" W x 24.25" D x 39" - 42.5" H, black. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Service Administration, Arlington, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 17, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

THE TECHNOLOGY: Composite and honeycomb structures are commonly used for their high strength and lowweight. However, they are characteristically poor at isolating internal structuralvibrations, which are transmitted as radiated noise. Traditionally, designers havereduced radiated noise by adding weighty sound insulation schemes, thereby compromisingthe purpose of the structurally efficient panel. NASA Langley solved the problem bycreating recessed areas in the core that lower the acoustic radiation efficiency. Sincethe recesses would have reduced the strength of the composite construction as well,Langley researchers created a variety of embedded reinforcing sub-face sheets and domedvariations of those sheets to carry the required loads.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate thedate and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information.RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses areprovided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO forthe purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conductingpreliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for futurelicensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO willfollow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  Nofollow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

The makeup of the group consists of approximately 55% military, 20% government civilians, 10% government contractors and 15% foreign military personnel.

<p><strong>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /><br />Basis for award: <br /></strong><br />(a) The Government will award contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />&bull; Factor 1 - Technical Capability<br />&bull; Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />&bull; Factor 3 - Management Approach<br />&bull; Factor 4 - Personnel Readiness<br />&bull; Factor 5 - Price/Cost<br /><br />Awardees may not necessarily be the proposal offering the lowest price or receiving the highest technical rating. This process permits trade-off among cost or price and non-cost factors and allow the government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.&nbsp;Factors 1 and 2 are equally important, and Factors 3 and 4 are equally important to each other, but less important than Factors 1 and 2. Each individual technical Factor is more important than price/cost. A rating of UNACCEPTABLE in either Factor 1 or 2 will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and, therefore, not eligible for award. The non-price factors are listed below in descending order of importance.<br /><br /><strong>1.1. Factor 1</strong>: Technical Approach/Qualifications: Vendors shall state their delivery capabilities and adequately describe their plans/approach in regards to readiness and deployment of PAS on a "National Scope". Similarly, they shall also describe their approach for meeting the 48 hour time constraint for OCONUS. Vendors shall describe a plan/approach which provides the Government with a high level of confidence for ensuring success. Vendors shall elaborate on how they have met, or will meet, state and territorial certification requirements for the Home Health Aides. Vendors shall also describe their approach to ensuring personnel have had completed background checks in advance, as well as provide assurance that any personnel deployed (Home Health Aides) will be insured and bonded.<br /><br />The proposal shall concisely describe the Offeror's response to the requirements of the solicitation. The use of general or vague statements such as "standard procedures will be used," "good engineering practice," and "will comply with specification," are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the Offeror's lack of understanding. Do not repeat information required in response to two or more evaluation factors. Present details in only one area of the proposal where it contributes most critically to the discussion. Where discussion of the same information is necessary, refer to the initial discussion and identify its location within the proposal. If required, cross-reference the proposal for traceability. Specific detailed evaluation factors are stated in this RFP. Fully address each factor in the appropriate section of your proposal.<br /><br />Clarity and completeness of the proposal are of the utmost importance. The proposal must be written in a practical, clear and concise manner. It must use quantitative terms whenever possible and must avoid qualitative adjectives to the maximum extent possible. Proposal volumes must be internally consistent or the proposal will be considered unrealistic and may be considered unacceptable.<br /><br /><strong>1.2. Factor 2:</strong> Past Performance: The past performance evaluation will examine the extent to which an Offeror has demonstrated their capability and capacity to perform the requirements of the SOW successfully. Accordingly, each separate instance of past performance will be evaluated for relevancy. A relevant contract is one that is of similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to the requirements set forth in this solicitation and SOW. A lack of relevant past performance history will result in an adjectival rating of Neutral, and will not count against a Vendor's proposal. Contractors who describe similar contracts and subcontracts should provide: <br /><br />(1) A detailed explanation demonstrating the similarity of their contract(s) to the requirements stated within the solicitation; <br />(2) A detailed description of the work performed for their specific contract(s); and <br />(3) The role performed, including whether the Contractor acted as a prime or a subcontractor. They shall also provide the name of the contracting and technical person(s) to be contacted with their full name, title, agency, telephone, and email address. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to contact references for verification, or additional information, and to consider other relevant past performance information other than the information submitted by the Vendor. FEMA does not assume the duty to cure any problems it finds in the information provided by the vendor - the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information remains with the vendor. As previously mentioned, a lack of relevant past performance will be given a Neutral rating. The Government also reserves the right to draw from Government databases (e.g. Past Performance Information Retrieval System, Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, etc.) for past performance consideration. <br />Offerors must submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment C) and provide at least three (3) references. Past Performance for subcontractors will not be evaluated. It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that all past performance questionnaires are received from evaluators in a timely manner. Evaluators shall submit Past Performance Questionnaires to Michelle.Calhoun@fema.dhs.gov prior to the solicitation closing date. <br /><br /><strong>1.3. Factor 3</strong>: Management Approach: The Contractor's approach to quality control identifies processes, procedures, and metrics which are likely to result in a successful outcome within proposed costs and on schedule. This shall demonstrate ability to plan and execute a program, and manage areas of schedule management, cost management, quality management, human resources management, quality assurance, configuration management, risk management, communications management, and the ability to assist the Government in establishing their reports with information held by the Contractor and/or its personnel. <br /><br /><strong>1.4. Factor 4</strong>: Personnel Readiness Under this approach, vendors shall outline their plan for maintaining a cadre of qualified personnel ready to respond to a declared disaster within their "National Scope" capabilities and within the time stated in the Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor's academic, technical, and professional qualifications and the "sufficiency of personnel proposed" are the most important aspects of staffing. This portion of a proposal shall demonstrate the Vendor's overall approach to meeting personnel requirements on an &lsquo;as needed basis'. <br /><br /><strong>1.5. Factor 5</strong>: Fixed Rates Although all non-price factors combined are considered significantly more important than price/cost, price/cost is still an important factor. If the technical proposals are determined to be virtually even through evaluation ratings, evaluation of fixed rates will become even more important as an evaluating factor.<br />Price proposals must adhere to the pricing structure established in Price/Cost Schedule (Attachment B). Each Offeror's price/cost proposal must be based on the Offeror's Technical proposal, the Government's specifications.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a Microsoft Excel document of the Price/Cost Schedule (Attachment B). Offerors must complete the spreadsheet in its entirety by filling in all yellow cells. Do not change or attempt to change the number of labor hours. Only complete the yellow cells of the attachment. <br /><br />For Fixed Rates, CLIN 0001, the Offeror shall propose a fully burdened rate per labor hour. The fully burdened rate for the Contractor shall be the price per Home Health Aide (hourly), profit, overhead, and G&amp;A. All requested ODCs (except daily per diem) require prior justification and authorization from the CO (and all applicable receipts shall be submitted w/ invoices). <br /><br />The proposed Fixed Rates will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness and shall be evaluated on the basis of the best value to the Government.<br /><br />ODCs: Separate CLINs will be established for ODCs for each Task Order as applicable. ODCs shall not be burdened with profit or fee. Estimated costs for CLIN 0002 (Travel) and CLIN 0003 (Other) are not required for proposal submission. Actual cost estimates for ODCs will be established at the Task Order level.<br /><br />Prices that are determined to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable. <br /><br />The Contractor's technical proposals will be rated using the following adjectival ratings:<br /><br />- Excellent<br />- Good<br />- Acceptable<br />- Unacceptable <br />- Neutral</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire on (To be competed at time of award) and that each such policy contains the following clause: "It is agreed that in the event of cancellation or any material change in the policy adversely affecting the interest of the Government in this insurance, 30 days prior written notice will be given to the Contracting Officer."<br />(End of clause)</p>

The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship NANCY FOSTER in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein.

Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 14 August 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaing the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

To comply with DoD mandate to get better value for defense goods, a target unit price reduction of 10 percent or better is established for this requirement.

It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the Dredge Goetz in the upper reaches of the Mississippi River. The dredge is of a hydraulic cutter suction configuration with a 22 inch suction and 20 inch discharge pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dredge is 225 feet long by 39 feet wide with an operating draft of 5 feet. The dredge power system is diesel-electric.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary diesel generating plant produces a total of 4,000 installed horsepower at 1,200 rpm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each generator is capable in producing 1,300 KVA at an 80% continuous duty cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Essential AC motors are controlled by means of variable frequency AC drive (VFD) components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The swing drive manufacturer is Alstom, model number MV3000. The dredge has swing winches installed on the port and starboard sides. The two winches are employed to swing the head of the dredge back and forth across the river, allowing the cutterhead and main dredge pump suction to break up and clear away material from the river bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While in operation one winch is hauling and the opposite is paying out cable under variable hold-back tension, with both cables being connected to external anchors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The paying-out cable is kept taut by dynamic braking through the winch gearing and VFD programming, preventing a slack cable situation. An operator controls the winches through console-mounted joystick controls which provide the means to regulate the speed at which the dredge swings back and forth and the degree of hold-back tension on the winch that is paying out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the dredge completes a swing from one side of the river to the other the swing process is reversed. The operator has the discretion to independently operate either the port and/or the starboard winch for other specific tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dredge operates 24 hours per day 7 days per week for about 6 to 8 months per year. During a 24 hour period, the swing winches typically log between 10 and 11 hours of running time. The remainder of the period the dredge is not swinging. Swing rates vary depending on the amount and hardness of the material being dredged. In hard material with a digging depth of several feet the swing speed (and drum speed) may be as low as 5 feet per minute at the maximum torque available from the drive. In light material with shallow cuts the swing speed will range up to 80 feet per minute at the maximum torque available from the drive. </span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplement with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote number RFQ HSCG44-12-Q-PC2123. This number is for tracking purposes only. Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-55. This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12 and 13. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 238210. The SBA size standard is $14.0 Million. Due to this Acquisition being considered to be a Sole Source Procurement it is not anticipated that the Contracting Officer will receive 2 or more Offers from qualified Small Business Concerns; therefore IAW FAR 19.502-2(a), This IS NOT A Small Business Set-A-Side. The USCG Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN) Portsmouth, VA. 23703, intends to purchase on a non-competitive basis by awarding a Firm Fixed Purchase Order Contract to: Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services, Inc. for professional engineering services to install an Isolation Transformer Kit into a Liebert Maintenance Bypass Cabinet (MBC) at USCG VTS Berwick Bay, 800 David Drive, Morgan City LA 70380.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.
  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:  

â€¢	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
â€¢	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
â€¢	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
â€¢	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.
  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.
  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshalâ€™s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under â€œbusiness access.â€  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.
  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractorâ€™s expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.
  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.
  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.
 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractorâ€™s employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services.  The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support.   The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03.   In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems.  This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG).

The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.  This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside.

<DESC>a. The purpose of this amendment is to specify specific dates for the two events due to other mission requirements.  As a result, the Basis for Award has changed as the government will no longer evaluate the most advantageous dates.<br>b. See below revised synopsis solicitation and revised additional information.<br>c. The time and date for receipt of quotes remains unchanged.<br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-55, effective 3 January 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the NAICS 721110 with a small business size standard of $30M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Events on March 30 - April 1, 2012 and May 5, 2012. The attached pricing schedules may be used for pricing or you may use your own pricing schedule.  However, your pricing schedule must clearly annotate pricing or the words "not separately priced" or "no cost" for each requirement identified.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable service fees.  In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided:  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rate(s) quoted by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable price(s).  However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A separate performance work statement (PWS) for each event is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR and DFARS Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, 52.252-1, 252.209-7999 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote all services, however, all lodging requirements must be quoted if providing lodging and all conference space and catering services shall be quoted if providing event services.  In determining the most advantageous pricing scenarios, the government will evaluate pricing as follows:  (1) Line items for lodging (attendee rooms, staff rooms and parking will be combined and line items for the event (required event space, to include audio visual and set-up requirements, catering requirements and parking) will be combined.  (2) If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging and event) for the event and this vendor offers the overall lowest price, one award will be made to one vendor.  (3) If one vendor is not able to meet all requirements, one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for lodging and one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for the event. (4) An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. Vendors are not required to quote on both events.<br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met for either area quoted:  <br><br>Group 1 (attendee lodging rooms, staff rooms, parking) (1) The quote must provide for all requirements within the group.  (2) The hotel facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The hotel facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The hotel facility proposed must be located in the area in or between Richmond, VA and Williamsburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange east on I64 to Williamsburg, VA) and (5) The hotel facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>Group 2 (event space, catering and parking) (1) The quote must provide for all services within the group, (2) The event facility proposed must have on-site parking sufficient for all attendees, and (3) The event facility proposed must be located in the area in or between Richmond, VA and Williamsburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange east on I64 to Williamsburg, VA).  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost.  For minimum requirement (2) an information sheet addressing the number of parking spaces available at the event facility must be provided.  For minimum requirement (3), the physical location of the proposed event facility must be provided.<br><br>In order for the event to be advantageous to the government, the lodging and event facilities per area must be located within five (5) miles of each other.  Therefore, a lodging quote only or an event quote only, in which there is no second location (event or lodging facility) quoting, will not be considered for award. As such, event and lodging facilities are encouraged to partner with each other and either one entity quote the entire requirement and enter into a subcontracting arrangement for the portion they are unable to provide or both parties ensure each entity will be quoting separately.<br> <br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I and DFARS provision 252.212-7001 shall be completed and returned with your offer.  If your company information is available through Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) so indicate in 52.212-3 and return only that portion of the provision.  <br><br>DFARS provision 252.209-7999 is provided as additional documentation and must be completed and returned with your offer.<br><br>FAR Provision 52.252-1 and FAR Clause 52.252-2:  full text language of provisions and clauses incorporated by reference can be located at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.   <br><br>FAR Clauses 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.232-18, 52.252-2 and DFARS Clauses 252.204-7003 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR clause 52.212-4 is amended as follows: paragraph (g) (1) change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices and add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF).

In addition, clauses, 52.222-41, 52.222-42, and 52.222-44 or 52.222-53, included in 52.212-5 may be deemed applicable pending contractor's response to FAR Provision 52.222-52 (included in FAR Provision 52.212-3 Alt I).  <br><br>The following clauses included in 252.212-7001 are applicable: 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003 and 252.247-7023 Alt III.  <br><br>All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to 4:00 p.m. ET, February 10, 2012.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372-3695.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UPDATED: 3 Feb 2012:<br /></span></strong>The Government is updating its response to industry question G-Q49. Please disregard the previously provided answer.
<p>G-Q49: Why has the Government set such a low target (5%) for small business subcontracting on this program? Other similar aircrew training system acquisitions by AFMC over the past 2 years, such as C-17, KC-135, etc, have has a much higher (20% +) target/requirement for small business participation. Will the Government consider raising the small business percentage to be in compliance with Air Force/DoD goals/targets?</p>
<p>Corrected Government Response: The Government will consider increasing the small business requirements identified in H-007.</p>

<DESC>As outlined in the Joint Cargo Unmanned Aerial Systems Concept of Operations document (attached), combat operations are conducted in a variety of environments (mountainous, desert, forest, jungle, at sea, and in urban/complex terrain) that are often characterized by rugged terrain and obstacles to ground vehicle transportation. In support of distributed operations, many Combat OutPosts (COPs) are located in obscure locations. Some missions can be conducted up to hundreds of miles from Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The extended lines of communication between forces and their FOBs are at risk of enemy ambush or Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack for both air and ground resupply assets.<br /><br />* The purpose of this amendment is to update the due date in FBO to 02/22/2012 at 2PM EST as stated in Amendment 1.

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  

Program Contracting Activity East - St. Louis
VA Medical Center, Bldg. 2
#1 Jefferson Barracks, Drive
St. Louis, MO  63125

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

EES Media Services plans to contract by means other than full and open competition for a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  The proposed awardee is American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA).

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

The Department of Veteran Affair, Veteran Health Administration, Employee Education System requires a series of online continuing education program for the Distance Learning Program.  The programs will be conducted via Audio Teleconferences. 
The estimated cost of this proposed acquisition is $24,470.00.  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( ? )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1 (ii) (a) 
	
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

a.  Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1 (ii)(a)) 
 
American Therapeutic Recreation Association is the only vendors that offers the distance learning program using teleconferences 1-hour workshops and live meetings to bring interactive distance learning capabilities to the therapist's duty station, allowing them to gain valuable learning experiences and help maintain their professional competences. 

The sole vendor approved to meet the VHA requirements is American Therapeutic Recreation Association.  This vendor's training supports VHAs national staff development requirements for Recreation and Creative Arts Therapists. Recreating this training would entail instructional design and development of content that is already available. The process would take many months in development, delay deliverables, and not be improved from the available COTS training. 


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

A thorough search of GSA and Google was done and no other vendors were identified that could be provide the required deliverables. 

The ATRA and VA Institute sessions require training on current and developing technologies, workflow considerations, specific system operation, physical medicine and rehabilitation techniques etc. The training is proprietary information and it would take a minimum of 12 months for another vendor to create the training and train their faculty to present this training.  This would not only be cost prohibitive and delay treatment plans for clinicians. This vendor is the only vendor that offers the online distance learning option which save numerous man hours and travel cost to the government.   

Also, according to Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Chapter 41 of Government Employee Training Act (GETA), allows the government to take advantage of all avenues, even those outside of government to train its employees.  No competition is required.  Paragraph 3 of Section 2 of the Act clearly states the intent. It states that "it is intended to improve public service, provide a more efficient workforce in the areas of expense and employee turnover and retain a well-educated workforce that is aware of developments in and out of government. From an administrative side, the intent is to provide uniform training and to ensure that all federal employees are treated equally in regard to job improvement".

Acquisition will not be synopsized in FedBizOpps as it is below the $25000.00 threshold.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
ATRA is a nonprofit organization and the only vendor to offer the required training. The price offered to the government is the same price offered to the commercial marketplace. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

The market research concluded that the training offered by ARTA is unique and there are no other vendors that can provide the online training and certifications. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 None
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
NA


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required

Prior to any new contract we will do market research to ensure that there has is no other vendor that can meet the needs of the Government.

<MODNBR>Modification P00018
<DESC>Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity<br />The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations.<br /><br />2. Nature and/or Description of the Action being Approved<br />The Government requires the extension to the task order period of performance from January 23, 2012 through July 22, 2012 for continuity of service. The Government also anticipates increasing the task order funding by $287,670.24 from $3,032,255.33 to $3,319,925.57 for the continuance of the service. The total task order ceiling mains unchanged from stated value in P00017 at $3,503,478.07. <br /><br />3. Description of Services<br />The OCIO Headquarters and OCIO Customs and Border Protection (CBP) require the contractor's continued performance of Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) statement of work tasks with the limits and the specified labor rates cited in the task order. The SOW tasks are as follows:<br /><br />Headquarters DHS OCIO: <br />&bull; Provide strategic advice and guidance; identify challenges and develop recommendations; and a develop a strategy to continuously improve the DHS OCIO organization and processes; <br />&bull; Review and analyze strategic initiatives; identifying alternative approaches and recommending solutions based on alignment to enterprise goals and capitalizing on industry, defense and federal best practices.<br />&bull; Develop Communication strategies to assist OCIO in communicating DHS OCIO enterprise wide goals to stakeholders; and, <br />&bull; Collaborate with the DHS CIO/DCIO to develop alternative strategies for enterprise-wide information sharing, security, performance and standards.</p>
<p>CBP OCIO:<br />&bull; Provide strategic advice and guidance; identify challenges and develop recommendations; and a develop a strategy to continuously improve the DHS OCIO organization and processes; <br />&bull; Review and clearly define OCIO Division roles and responsibilities; analyze and identify gaps and duplication; and make recommendations for improvement; <br />&bull; Review current practices and recommend alternative approaches for the OCIO to successfully drive transformation capitalizing on how private sector organizations would approach similar situations and recommending what models, processes and tools would best serve the mission;<br />&bull; Review and recommend alternative ways to meet strategic goals;<br />&bull; Develop Communication strategies to assist OCIO in communicating DHS OCIO enterprise wide goals to stakeholders and<br />&bull; Review and analyze strategic initiatives; identifying alternative approaches and recommending solutions based on alignment to enterprise goals and capitalizing on industry, defense and federal best practices.<br />&bull; Support to the assigned project team throughout the life cycle of the project.<br />&bull; Support the CIO executives in interfacing and communicating with DHS Oversight/Stakeholders, as directed.<br /><br />4. Identification of the exception to fair opportunity<br />This justification is in accordance with the FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C ). The order must be issued on a sole source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a follow-on to an order already issued under the contract. All offerors solicited for the award were given a "fair opportunity" to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>Task Order # HSHQDC-07-J-00355</p>
<p>A six month extension is required for continuity of service and transition to the follow-on contractor. The contractor has extensive knowledge of the task order statement of work; therefore issuing a new task order would not be an efficient use of funds or time because a new contractor would have to rampantly come up the learning curve with the task order requirements and develop a rapport with the OCIO senior leadership staff during the six month period.</p>
<p>5. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable<br />The anticipated cost for the six month extension is based on the EAGLE Task Order Option Period IV hourly rate of XXX. This rate was determined to be fair and reasonable during the evaluation of the EAGLE contract. A comparison of the contractor's rate for the Subject Matter Expert (SME) labor category with other EAGLE contractors' SME labor rates indicated that the contractor's labor rate is competitive.</p>
<p>6. Any other facts supporting the justification<br />A lapse in contractor support would be detrimental to the Program's mission for several Data Center Transition initiatives related to the activities within DHS that directly impact One DHS.</p>
<p>7. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that lead to the exception to fair opportunity before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.<br />The current task order expires January 22, 2012. The CBP Contracting Officer plans to issue a solicitation for a follow-on task order to satisfy requirements that are being performed by the current contractor. The release of the solicitation was delayed due to the Continuing Resolution (CR). The anticipated RFP release date is January 30, 2012. The advance acquisition plan number for the follow-on requirement is 201171983.</p>
<p><br />8. I certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for the justification, is accurate and complete.</p>
