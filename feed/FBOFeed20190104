<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334413 with a size standard of 1250 employees. <br /><br /><br />AFRL/RITC requires the purchase a picosecond pulsed laser source at 369nm, with low output noise for ongoing, in-house quantum information research. The required laser system is comprised of the following components and the associated specifications:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Mira HP-P:</strong> (P/N: 1110587) a high-power Titanium: Sapphire ultrafast picosecond laser with lens mode-locking technology built on a temperature compensated, easy-to access baseplate providing quick and convenient picosecond/CW reconfiguration.<br />- Key specifications:<br />- Output power &gt; 2.8 W<br />- Pulsewidth &lt; 2 ps<br />- Tuning range 700-980 nm <br />- Repetition Rate 76 MHz<br />- Noise &lt; 0.1% (Measured RMS in a 10 Hz to 20 MHz bandwidth)<br />- includes closed-loop chiller and Optima controller unit<br /><strong><br /><br />Verdi G18 OPSLaser-Diode System</strong>: (P/N 1225494) an Optically Pumped Semiconductor Laser (OPSL) with an output power of &gt;18W @ 532nm, single transverse mode, TEM 00. OPSL technology eliminates thermal lensing issues and allows the power to be adjusted without affecting beam parameters, including beam diameter, beam divergence, and M2. The short upper state lifetime eliminates green noise. Includes heat exchanger and water tubes. <br />- Key Specifications:<br />- Single transverse mode, lowest noise specification <br />- No thermal lensing or "green noise" issues<br />- RMS Noise: &lt; 0.02 % rms (10Hz - 100MHz)<br />- Max power consumption: 1.25kW (90 - 250 VAC)<br />- No need for strict control of diode temperature via temp. servo<br />- PermAlign, no realignment necessary<br />- Manufactured and sealed in cleanroom<br />- Efficient pumping with only one diode module<br />- Includes a riser to bring the Verdi G laser's output beam at the correct beam height to pump a Mira or MBR laser. <br />- includes a solid state chiller, which can be integrated in the Mira's or MBR's cooling circuit.<br /><strong><br /><br />SHG for Mira Pico</strong>: Second Harmonic Generating (SHG) unit used to double the wavelength output of the MIRA from 739nm to 369.5nm. <br /><strong><br /><br />Syncrolock Ap Laser</strong>-Laser/Slow/Fast Ext Trig/Internal Clock Config: W/Two Miras; a system which allows for the synchronization of multiple lasers, and is compatible with the MIRA laser system. - Compatible with the MIRA system.<br /><strong><br /><br />Pulse Picker 9200:</strong> Provides precise control of the pulse repetition rate over the widest range available. Provides simple, single-pass diffraction of the pulse train with a high efficiency, SiO2 Bragg cell. A dedicated, CPU-controlled electronics module adjusts all parameters of the RF pulses and displays all diagnostics on a four level LCD display. <br />- Key Specifications: <br />- Dedicated controller for RF power, pulsewidth, delay and phase.<br />- Single optics set 700-1000nm range<br />- Compatible with the MIRA system<br /><br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for the purchase of the items described above with: Coherent, Inc., 5100 Patrick Henry Dr., Santa Clara, CA 95054-1112.<br /><br /><br />The Government has made a determination that no other source can meet this requirement. <br /><br /><br />To the Government's knowledge, Coherent, Inc. is the only source capable of providing a&nbsp;laser system with the correct pulse widths, sufficiently low noise values, and which operates at the required wavelengths. Coherent is the only known manufacturer of a picosecond Titanium: Sapphire (Ti:Saph) laser with noise levels less than 0.1% measured RMS in a 10 Hz to 20 MHz bandwidth. This system with the frequency doubler (SHG) is one of the fundamental laser systems required to perform a trapped ion entanglement experiment. The wavelength range of the MIRA allows for a 739nm output to be doubled to 369.5nm, using the compatible SHG module. These wavelengths are required to interact with the species of ion that are being used in the entanglement experiment. The low noise level and output power of this system allows for the alignment of the system in both location and time to multiple ions located in different vacuum chambers. <br /><br />The additional Coherent components, when combined with the MIRA picosecond laser, form a laser system with the desired output wavelengths, optical power, noise level, and repetition rate. To ensure compatibility and interoperability with the MIRA Ti:Saph picosecond laser, it is essential that the associated components/equipment are provided by Coherent. <br /><br />Coherent is the only source capable of providing a laser system with the required functionality and performance characteristics described above.<br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br /><br />Responses received will be evaluated however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 15 February 2019.<br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in <br />accordance with applicable regulation.<br /><br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate<br />26 Electronic Parkway<br />Rome, New York 13441 <br />United States

<DESC><p>Project Description: <br />To support the bed down of F-35A aircraft at Nellis AFB, NV, additions to two existing maintenance facilities will be constructed. Facilities selected for expansion include Missile Maintenance Facility, Building 10432 and Munitions Maintenance Facility, Building 10439. Munitions Maintenance Facility, Building 10439 will be the Base Bid for this contract and Missile Maintenance Facility, Building 10432 will be Option 1.</p>
<p>Building 10432 Missile Maintenance Facility (OPTION 1)<br />The Missile Maintenance Facility is inside of the Base Munitions Storage Area perimeter. The building is located on a down-sloping site and will require fill to support construction of the bay addition and added vehicle access clearance.<br />Expansion of Building 10432 will consist of adding a single 50' x 60' (nominal) bay at the west end of the structure. The expansion bay will attach to the existing reinforced concrete blast wall at the west side of the building and will include a new reinforced concrete blast wall at the west end of the new bay. The bay will be serviced by a single 2 ton overhead hoist providing full area coverage. The roofing over the bay will consist of a standing seam metal explosive venting system with restraining devices capable of releasing blast overpressure conditions in the event of an accidental explosion.</p>
<p>Building 10439 Munitions Maintenance Facility (BASE BID)<br />The Munitions Maintenance Facility is inside of the Base Munitions Storage Perimeter. The building is located on an up- sloping site which will require cut to clear a level site for construction of the addition and added vehicle access. Expansion of Building 10439 will consist of adding two 30' x 50' (nominal) bays at the east side of the structure. Location of existing utilities precludes construction of the expansion bays adjacent to the existing building. Therefore, the new expansion bays will be separated from the existing building by approximately 17 feet. Since the new addition will be a separate structure apart from Building 10439, NAFB Facilities Management will assign a new building number 10440 for identification. The west bay of the Building 10440 will serve as a light duty maintenance bay and the east bay will serve munitions maintenance operations. Exterior walls of Building 10440 will consist of reinforced concrete masonry units while the bay separation wall will be reinforced concrete. The munitions maintenance bay will be provided with a 2 ton overhead hoist. Roofing at the light duty bay will be a standard structural standing seam metal system, with a restrained explosive venting standing seam metal roof system installed over the munitions maintenance bay.</p>
<p>General Features<br />Existing utilities serving the buildings will be upgraded as required and extended to the new Building 10432 addition and Building 10440. At Building 10439, existing service utilities will be extended to the new Building 10440 through an above-grade utility corridor spanning over the existing below-grade utilities routed parallel to the east side of Building 10439. Lightning Protection is a key activity for these projects and will require verification during construction and a Third Party approval of the completed system.</p>
<p>THIS PROJECT IS RESTRICTED TO SMALL BUSINESSES. IT WILL BE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), BEST VALUE LOWEST PRICE TECHNCIALLY ACCEPTABLE. The procurement method used will be a Design-Bid-Build best value lowest price technically acceptable. Eligible offerors will be required to provide a technical and price proposal for consideration of award. The technical proposal will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP. Those offers that are determined to be Technically Acceptable will then be evaluated based on the lowest price submitted.<br />Plans and specifications will not be provided in paper copy.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT</strong><br /><strong>GLOBAL ADAPTIVE PLANNING - COLLABORATIVE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT 2.0 (GC2.0)</strong> <br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />AFLCMC/HBCK, 901 SAC Blvd (Suite 1H11), Offutt, AFB NE 68123<br /><br /><strong>A: INTRODUCTION:</strong><br />This Sources Sought synopsis is being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10, Market Research; a solicitation is not available at this time. This posting is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and in no way restricts the Government's final acquisition strategy. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)/HBCK is seeking qualified sources to perform software development services by providing all tasks required for the maintenance, sustainment, and enhancement of the Global Adaptive Planning-Collaborative Information Environment 2.0 (GC2.0) software application. Tasks may include, but are not limited to, program management, system and software engineering, automated and manual testing, configuration management, cyber security, database management, quality assurance, and on-site customer support. The intent is for software development processes employed to allow for rapid, high quality, continuous software deliveries (e.g. Agile software development methodologies). The GC2.0 contract is being contemplated as a base, with four option years, and an overall contract value of less than $49M.</p>
<p>The Contractor must possess and maintain a TOP SECRET (TS) level facility clearance, and personnel providing on-site support may also be required to possess a TS Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance. Additionally, most software development will occur within the Contractor's facility, therefore an accredited SECRET level development lab, and the ability to store SECRET level information will be required. Bi-weekly software integration will occur at the Government facility, to include checkout and testing on the classified networks.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services which has a small business size standard of $27.5M. A small business firm competing as a prime contractor must be able to perform at least 50% of the total requirement within its own company (reference FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting).</p>
<p><strong>B. GC2.0 DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong>GC2.0 supports a real-time, net-centric, federated planning capability that integrates operational information and creates an automated "Courses of Action" suite the National Command Authority (NCA) assesses to weigh appropriate responses. As an inherent part of this capability, GC2.0 integrates external situational awareness data with planning data in order to present a view of the current operational environment.</p>
<p>GC2.0 provides global planners (National, Strategic, and Operational levels) a user-definable set of workspaces that can be process-structured for data, information and services orchestration. The planning workspaces support collaborative, web-based joint planning on multiple security enclaves for rapid development and maintenance of "living plans", and when necessary, the dynamic transition of integrated courses of action (COAs) to execution.</p>
<p>GC2.0 is part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Program office, which is an operational information technology system of systems (SoS) spanning multiple security enclaves to support strategic leadership decision making and to provide operational war planning and analysis capabilities for USSTRATCOM missions. ISPAN consists of two components, in which GC2.0 is one of them.</p>
<p>Joint Requirements and Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 016-09 established ISPAN as the Department of Defense (DOD) Program of Record for Combatant Commander (CCDR)/strategic level joint COA development. In practice, the COA development process is a subset of joint planning, is doctrine-based, and is applicable across the planning spectrum for both campaign/contingency and crisis planners. Planning outputs include presentations during the process (e.g. briefings), outputs at the end (e.g. documents), and situational awareness throughout (e.g. "dashboard" style information display of the operational environment). GC2.0 will reuse and refine valuable parts of the existing planning functions to support new mission areas, with reengineering to increase speed and efficiency at the user interface. One recent implementation of this approach is the Dashboard capability, which allows users to construct flexible situational awareness views through the addition of customizable gadgets to a canvas. These gadgets provide connections to authoritative data sources and the GC2.0 planning environment, with visualization in multiple forms. Enhancing the Dashboard capability to provide more gadget types, more data sources, and better performance is expected to be a major focus of this sustainment effort. This makes the system's planning capabilities equally useful for fusing and presenting current operations situational awareness information. A subset of customers utilizes the operational environment view (a.k.a. dashboards) exclusively.</p>
<p>As part of the operational environment view, external data is consumed through a variety of methods, including web services, RSS feeds, KML/KMZ files, Common Route Definition (CRD) files, etc. Incremental enhancements of this capability is necessary to maintain the system's cybersecurity posture, ensure the code base remains supportable, and provide additional enhancement and development capabilities, to include scaling the system larger and smaller for a wider user base.</p>
<p>GC2.0 will continue to evolve to support an open, flexible, scalable, and extensible architecture that is standards-based, compatible and interoperable with the Global Information Grid (GIG), along with its existing and emerging systems and programs. At the conclusion of current efforts, the system will have completed one major update to remove technology at or near obsolescence. Additional COTS and FOSS updates are expected. The code base is comprised of approximately 200,000 source lines of code; approximately half custom code and half open source. It is primarily Java, JavaScript, and HTML. It utilizes an Angular user interface, Oracle database, Oracle WebLogic application servers, Oracle Service Bus, and Apache web servers, operating in a virtual machine environment. Other FOSS products incorporated include LeafletJS, GeoTools, TinyMCE, docx4j, Hazelcast, JQuery, JQuery UI, Spring, Hibernate, DropWizard, Docker, and neo4j. It exchanges data with external systems using a variety of web services, some of which utilize the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise Messaging 4.0 (EM4) service. Infrastructure and application code is installed, configured, and deployed using Ansible. Code quality is monitored using a variety of products, including SonarQube and Fortify. The development environment will be expected to utilize Confluence, Jira, Jenkins, Maven, Protractor, and Selenium, among other products.</p>

<DESC>GUARDIAN ANGEL (GA) <br />Hands-Free Desalinator<br />FA8629-18-R-5022<br />Source Sought Synopsis/Request for Information
<p><br />1, NOTICE<br />This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes and market research only; it does not constitute a solicitation. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparing/submitting information in response to this posting. The information provided may be used by the Government in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained within their response as instructed later in this posting.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE<br />The United States (US) Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance &amp; Special Operations Forces (ISR &amp; SOF) Directorate, Battlefield Airmen (BA) Program Office (AFLCMC/WISN) is conducting market research to identify possible sources capable of providing a hands-free desalinator that will improve the capabilities of GA operators conducting maritime rescue operations in open-ocean environments. Current manual desalinators require one GA person to man the pump to produce enough water for the entire team and IP's at the exclusion of other rescue duties. A hands-free desalinator would free that person up to enable performance of other required duties to support the rescue mission overall. The purpose of this SSS/RFI is to assess the ability of suppliers to provide the desired capability.</p>
<p>3. CAPABILITY GAP<br />Guardian Angel (GA) forces are tasked to extricate personnel in large bodies of open water to include oceans. The current equipment utilized to provide potable drinking water during these missions is a Commercial of the Shelf (COTs) desalination device that requires hand-pumping to obtain potable water. The drinking water produced by hand pump desalination devices are only designed to support a few people. Since the number of survivors is usually a variable, a more robust solution to creating drinking water is needed. Furthermore, the requirement for a team member to pump the desalinator takes a person out of the fight. If a more critical need presents itself (such as medical treatment) the team may be forced to choose between personal survival and mission needs.</p>
<p>The intended replacement system characteristics are:<br />- A small, lightweight (one-man carry) automated desalination system to free up rescue personnel for critical mission tasks, and to ensure survivability of all personnel. <br />- The solution must not present hazards to personnel or equipment while employed on-board a combat rubber raider craft. <br />- System must be air-deployable from an aircraft or helicopter as part of a Rigged Alternate Method Boat (RAMB). <br />- Other features/constraints as defined in paragraph 4.b.</p>
<p>4. INSTRUCTION TO POTENTIAL RESPONDENTS<br />Interested parties who desire to participate in this SSS/RFI are encouraged to submit responses that demonstrate they presently have the technology and qualifications to provide the system described above. Responses shall include the following information and address the topics below:</p>
<p>a. Respondent Data: <br />Company/Institute Name<br />Address<br />Point of Contact (to include phone number and email address)<br />CAGE Code<br />Web Page URL<br />Pursuant to NAICS Code 333318, Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing, (size standard 1000 employees) state whether the company is:</p>

<p><br />PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to redesign, repair and/or manufacture the Multi-Function Display (MFD-255K) for KC-135 aircraft:</p>
<p>NOUN NSN P/N<br />Multi-Function Display (MFD-255K) 5841-01-504-5586CW 822-1006-201</p>
<p>This requirement is for production engineering and repair services to provide a future Sources of Supply (SOS) and Source of Repair (SOR) in support of multi-year repair contracts continuing through the life expectancy of the KC-135 aircraft (FY2040). The projected quantities will be Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) of 624 repairs per year.</p>
<p>The Government's need for proposed production engineering and repair services are required to address obsolescence issues, including conversion of the legacy LCD to a more sustainable format, and is expected to provide a long-term and affordable sustainability solution to support KC-135 missions.</p>
<p>The MFD-255K works within the WXR-700X Color Weather Radar System which is a solid state airborne X-band radar with its receiver-transmitter (RT) operating at 9.33GHz. The RT generates high energy transmit pulses and receives reflected return signals from precipitation, ground terrain, or aircraft (skin paint) targets depending upon the mode of operation selected. Receive circuits process the return signals into MFD-255K display. In addition to normal weather detection, the RT can detect turbulence and wind shear events which is vital to flight safety. Five MFDs installed in the KC-135 flight deck provide a multi-color visual display of avionics data (see Figure 1-1 through Figure 1-3). Active Matrix/Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) MFDs installed at the pilot (MFD1A/B/C), copilot (MFD2A/B) and navigator crew positions display critical flight information for improved daytime and nighttime readability and situational awareness. The MFDs display the Attitude Director Indicator (ADI), terrain &amp; weather information, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) indications and a Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI). The current MFD-255K display heads used on KC-135R/T aircraft are over 20 years old and are no longer manufactured or procurable.</p>

<DESC>Title: Implementation of Inpatient and Medical Benefit Pharmaceuticals Formulary Management in the Department of Defense
<p><br />RFI #: HT0011-19-RFI-0040 INPATIENT-CLINIC ADMINISTERED PHARMACEUTICALS FORMULARY MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>1. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that a solicitation will be issued. This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bids (IFB).</p>
<p>2. Please note that the collection of this requested information does not obligate the U.S. Government to incorporate any solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to procure the services. Proprietary information should not be included in the RFI response. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is not liable to pay any costs associated with companies responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>3. All information received resulting from this RFI will be used by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) for acquisition planning and market research purposes only. However, your response may be releasable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). If you wish the DHA to consider any portion of your response as "confidential commercial information", you should clearly mark the portion as "confidential commercial information".</p>
<p>4. The Defense Health Agency (DHA), at its discretion, may request respondents to this RFI to elaborate on information in their written response. Respondents to this RFI will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided.</p>
<p>5. The DHA invites all interested parties to submit a written response to this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is issued for the sole purpose of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The DHA is the Department of Defense (DoD) organization responsible for managing the TRICARE health care benefits. This includes a world-class pharmacy benefit to all eligible beneficiaries through the integration of state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2017, under Section 702 mandates that DHA will be responsible for establishing priorities for health care administration and management; policies, procedures, and direction for the provision of direct care at Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). As part of the initiatives to implement this NDAA, DHA Pharmacy will have authority over pharmacy services enterprise-wide to include formulary management across both inpatient and outpatient settings. While DHA currently operates a robust formulary management process for outpatient settings via the Pharmacy Operations Division Formulary Management Branch, the focus of the current activity has centered on outpatient physician prescribed medications available via direct care, mail, and retail network. The new initiative will allow Formulary Management Branch to assess pharmaceutical agents that are considered part of the medical benefit for formulary consideration.</p>
<p>Statement of Capability</p>
<p>1. The Government is interested in gaining insight on commercial best practices and developing requirements for the delivery of comprehensive formulary management specifically focusing on inpatient and medical benefit pharmaceuticals. As a result, the DHA is performing market research to ascertain interest, capabilities, and available solutions within the healthcare industry to address areas of defining the process, training, documentation, measuring and analyzing data, and promoting an inpatient and medical benefit pharmaceuticals formulary management program. While we are primarily interested in solutions to Direct Care settings, we would also be interested in solutions that may apply to Purchased Care settings as well, particularly those that have successful implementations across similar settings. Direct Care settings include those where health care is provided within the Military Health System clinics and medical centers, often referred to as a Military Treatment Facility (MTF). Purchased Care is health care provided outside the MTF by network and non-network providers. Typically this is via managed care support contractors at facilities in the civilian sector. Interested parties are asked to submit information which includes but is not limited to the following commercial best practices for the implementation:</p>
<p>a. Elements of a formulary management program focused on medications administered in varied settings to include inpatient, procedural areas (e.g. same day surgery, endoscopy suite), clinic administered, and physician administered agents<br />i. Describe the elements including the required resources<br />ii. Describe how the elements are provided<br />iii. Describe how often the elements are provided<br />iv. Describe the value the elements provide<br />b. Based on your capabilities, methods, and recommendations, please define the inpatient/clinic-administered pharmaceutical formulary management process and assessment of a successful process:<br />i. describe characteristics or conditions of an inpatient/clinic-administered pharmaceutical formulary management program which are identified with a high degree of success or higher rate of failure;<br />c. Describe your capability, methods and/or industry practice for training for current and future staff with emphasis on industry best practices for developing and maintaining a team to manage an inpatient/clinic-administered pharmaceutical formulary. <br />d. Describe your capability or industry technologies for developing approaches to inpatient/clinic-administered pharmaceutical formulary management. Technology features should include, but is not limited to:<br />i. Methods for identifying opportunities where formulary management tools could be used to: improve patient safety, encourage appropriate medication use, improve adherence, increase standardization within each facility and across all facilities, and decrease costs <br />ii. Methods to effectively measure impact of programs;<br />iii. Methods to improve access to pharmaceuticals and decrease administrative burden;<br />iv. Methods to promote a uniform pharmacy benefit;<br />v. Methods to reduce acquisition cost of drugs; and<br />vi. Define parameters used to evaluate the success of the program at the humanistic, economic and system levels.<br />e. Describe your capability and/or recommendations on methods to compare program results at the pharmacy, clinic, treatment facility, and enterprise-wide levels to nationally recognized metrics or other patient oriented outcomes that matter.<br />f. Describe your capability and/or recommendations on methods to maximize acceptance of the program among clinical staff, particularly prescribers.<br />g. Describe your capability and recommendations on the use of pharmacists in the inpatient or clinic setting and ensuring alignment with formulary management within that setting.<br />h. Describe your approach to and/or considerations on program variations that are dependent on the various MTF and clinic types (large Medical Center versus a predominantly outpatient focused clinic), where the relevant service is rendered.<br />i. Describe any other valuable features that should be included in the inpatient/clinic-administered pharmaceutical Formulary Management program from lessons learned during previous formulary management deployments and suggest data driven alternatives to established processes of formulary management.</p>
<p>Information Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>The Government encourages responses from interested parties who are capable of responding to the entire scope of the RFI, as well as interested parties who may have specific expertise in only limited areas of this RFI.<br /><br />Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER: H9821019RXXXX
<p>Request for Information: Improved Information Sharing (IIS) Between DoD, Relatives and Friends of Service Members (SMs) Regarding the Experiences and Challenges of Military Services</p>
<p>Defense Human Resources Activity is issuing this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources for providing the services in accordance with the Concept of Operations. This notice shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. In addition, it does not guarantee that a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI/sources sought notice is voluntary and will assist in selecting the appropriate solicitation type/method, etc. Costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SEEKING PROPOSALS AND WILL NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>1. The proposed NAICS for this effort is 541511 - Custom Computer programming Services (size standard $27.5 Million). Comments on this NAICS and suggestions for alternative codes must include supporting rationale.</p>
<p>2. The Government is specifically performing Market Research to see if there are potential vendors who can provide the following:</p>
<p>a. The proposed system will have an applet front-end provided to accessing Service Members (SM) that will enable the SM to designate up to 15 family members or significant friends that will receive information about the SM's experiences at selected stages in their Military life.</p>
<p>b. The system would then provide a "push" of specific information to the designees at key events that occur in the SM's life. When a push message is generated, information would be incorporated into the message that would provide explanation of the event or a link to more detailed descriptions of the event and the events implications. Each of the designees would receive the same message. Push could be by email or text message at the SMs discretion.</p>
<p>c. The intent of the system is to provide specific information coupled to event data to people in the SMs personal support structure such as family members or significant supporting people in the SMs life. It has been identified that these people (as well as inexperienced SMs) often do not know when an important or challenging event has occurred (or is about to occur) in the SMs life; and when they do know they often do not understand the nature of the event or the existing support mechanisms available to them and the SM to successfully overcome the challenges.</p>
<p>d. Automating the process of identifying stressors/challenge events for inexperienced SMs and supporting personal people will provide a "heads up" so that the SM/support people will not have the burden of researching solutions once a stressor event is occurring. These events would need to be identified by more experienced DoD personnel or other experts and suggested solutions scripted to be pushed out, so that the SM and identified significant people are more "ready" and less challenged.</p>
<p><br />SUBMISSION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>A. COVER SHEET - 1 page</p>
<p>1. Vendor name, address, website, Data Universal Numbering Systems (DUNS) Number, and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.</p>

<p>3. Type of business, including socio-economic category (Large, Small, 8(a) Participant, Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone, Woman-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Non-Profit)</p>
<p>4. If applicable, GSA contract number, schedule, etc.</p>
<p>B. CAPABILITIES STATEMENT &amp; MARKET INFORMATION - no more than 10 pages</p>
<p>1. Please describe your organization's breadth of expertise/competency with respect to the Critical Functions anticipated to be needed to perform successfully:</p>

<p>o Experience, expertise, knowledge to provide recommendations and perform, modifications. Along with the ability to review, determine and develop an update based on outside input from a source such as a SM.</p>
<p>o Ability to independently research DoD websites, pertinent SM information, reports, videos, brochures, social media posts and media articles. That reflect the interest of the SM.</p>
<p>o Expertise in keeping the SMs and SMs designated personnel interested in the SMs ongoing events, projects, community, outside interest, etc.</p>
<p>o Identify any condition or action that could potentially restrict competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solutions. Also, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such a conclusion.</p>

<DESC>Description:
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  The Stem Cell Translation Lab (SCTL) within the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has established a workflow to develop reporter cell lines which entails transfection, single-cell dissociation, and single-cell deposition into multi-well plates using a specialized type of flow cytometry called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We have determined that the bottleneck of our current workflow is the poor survival of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) after single-cell deposition into multi-well plates by FACS. The cell damage is due to the working principle of FACS, which involves the acceleration of cells into the fast-flowing sheath fluid. iPSCs suffer substantially from this process and have a poor recovery. The consequent low clonality results in extensive screen time and low efficiency.</p>
<p>Project requirements: NCATS seeks a single-cell printer that enables gentle, fully automated single-cell plating into microwell plates for iPSCs clonal expansion. The device must be able to single-cell sort cells into microwell plates with an efficiency greater than 80%, provide increased cell viability of 75%, feature use of disposable single-use cell printing microfluidic cartridges to reduce contamination and generate pico-liter droplets that encapsulate cells, and posess FDA approval for monoclonality, image-based documentation and 5-40um cell range coverage.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: Delivery to be 2-6 weeks after receipt of order.</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought. Respondents must provide product literature or other information clearly describing how their product meets the project requirements.</p>
<p>Respondents must also provide their  DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc., pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>The response must include the respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>All responses to this notice must be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist.  Facsimile responses are NOT accepted.</p>
<p>The response must be submitted to Stuart Kern, Contract Specialist, at stuart.kern@nih.gov, by 1:00 p.m. Eastern time, Friday, January 11, 2019.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes:  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality: No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to use a brand name product. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific (NAVFAC Pacific) is performing a market survey to determine if other potential sources of supply can provide meters for switches that have equal performance and listing/approval requirements as Cisco Industrial 2000 Series Switches.  

The existing NAVFAC Hawaii cybersecurity/smartgrid solution serving the project is a secured network, Control System Platform Enclave (CSPE), consisting of proprietary hardware and software including hosting the WebCTRL ALC system. The NAVFAC Hawaii CSPE is part of a NAVFAC enterprise solution to cybersecure all NAVFAC maintained industrial control systems.  As part of this project, the Government needs to expand the existing CSPE WebCTRL System to include the new programmable controllers, routers and software.
 In order to be complete and usable, the system provided needs to be of identical make/model of the existing network as to maintain the networks cybersecurity Authority-to-Operate (ATO). The expansion of the CSPE requires one (1) switch with the following characteristics: 

1.	Four, eight, or 16 10/100 Base-T Ethernet ports (Small Form-Factor Pluggable [SFP] downlinks on selected models); fixed configurations with a compact form factor
2.	Dual-input DC power supply, alarm relays, DIN rail mount
3.	Industrial Power of Ethernet (PoE) solution
4.	Two gigabit combo ports: SFP (100 Mbps and 1 Gbps) or RJ45 uplink
5.	802.1x, port security, and DHCP, dynamic port-based authentication; Secure Shell (SSHv2); SNMPv3 provides encrypted administrator traffic during Telnet and SNMP sessions; TACACS+ and RADIUS authentication facilitate centralized control and restrict unauthorized users.

6.	Resilient Ethernet Protocol ring and PROFINET  Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP)

This notification is for market research purposes only to identify if other potential sources of supply can meet the requirements of the Government. This is not a request for proposals, quotes or an invitation for bid. The intent of this notice is to identify other potential sources for this product. 

To be considered, please submit detailed technical data in order for the Government to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of your product to ensure compatibility with the existing system. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), a response to this notice is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all federal agencies.
Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $100,000 is required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address:  https://cpscontractor.nih.gov.  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-l@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771.  Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the Contractor s registered representative.
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually.  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.  The report shall be assigned in the CPS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment.  The Contractor representative shall have thirty days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer. 
Failure to have a current registration with the NIH CPS database, or to re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer within those thirty days, will result in the Government s evaluation being place on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond.

NUSF does not include areas such as stairs, elevators, mechanical and utility rooms, ducts, shafts, vestibules, public corridors and public toilets required by local code.  A detailed definition will be provided by VA, should a solicitation for offers or request for proposals be issued for this project.

A city block from its current location; which is bound by the following roads or must front on any of the following roads:
North: Hale Street
East: Clermont Street
South: East 9th Street
West: Bellaire Street
Lease Term: Up to three years. The proposed space must be prepared for immediate occupancy
 
All submissions should include the following information:

NUSF available, if offering existing space;
Estimated cost to VA per NUSF

<SUBJECT>Request for Solutions: Family of Maintenance Trainers (FMT) Common Core (CC) Architecture and Software Baseline

<DESC><h3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Request for Solutions:<br />Family of Maintenance Trainers (FMT) Common Core (CC) Architecture and Software Baseline<br />03 January 2018</h3>
<p><strong>1. PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>This Request for Solutions (RFS) is issued to locate capable vendors with the ability to develop a prototype FMT - CC architecture and software baseline to support the existing FMT Product Line (PL) and future Virtual Training Systems (VTS). The purpose of this effort is to analyze existing systems, develop a prototype CC PL Architecture and software baseline, and validate the CC Architecture by developing prototype maintenance trainers for multiple vehicle platforms. The RFS scope is limited to the development of the prototype Diagnostic and Troubleshooting Trainer (DTT) which is part of the FMT PL. Information related to the Hands-on-Trainer (HOT) and Part Task Trainer (PTT) variants of maintenance training systems is provided for reference only. The Government will evaluate the solutions with the intent of awarding an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) in accordance with 10 U.S. Code &sect; 2371b.</p>
<p><strong>2. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Training and Readiness Accelerator (TReX)</strong></p>
<p>Vendors interested in responding to this RFS must be members of the TReX consortium. This project will be managed by the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Virtual Training Systems (PdM VTS).</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Overview</strong></p>
<p>The FMT-CC Product Line includes, but is not limited to the Stryker, Abrams, Bradley, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), and Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) maintenance trainers. As the AMPV is a new vehicle, the Government will require demonstration of the utility of the trainer prototype in a classroom environment. The maintenance trainers henceforth will be referred to as "the trainer." The trainer is comprised of three classes of devices: the Diagnostic/Troubleshooting Trainers (DTTs), the Part Task Trainers (PTTs), and Hands-On-Trainers (HOTs). These systems provide Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) skill level development for system operation, fault diagnosis, troubleshooting, adjustments, component removal/replacement, and other servicing and repair tasks for the respective vehicles. Each of these variants targets specific training goals but share common training elements.<br /><br /><strong>*** To view the full RFS for this effort, please visit the TReX website at the following link: </strong><a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/2019/01/family-of-maintenance-trainers/"><strong>https://trainingaccelerator.org/2019/01/family-of-maintenance-trainers/</strong></a><strong> ***</strong></p>

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office 6, Hampton VA 23667, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for the procurement of a Ventana HE600 System (06917259001) for the Asheville VAMC with Roche Diagnostics Corporation, in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source.

This is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation is available. Market research has determined that this equipment is highly specialized, is only available from a single source without an unacceptable delay or duplication of cost and no other type of items will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to award the contract with an effective date of 9 January 2019 to Roche Diagnostics Corporation., 915 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN, 46256. DUNS: 001824663.

This is a Brand-Name Only requirement to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Asheville VAMC. The HE60O is a 3-in-1 machine. It houses the oven for drying slides after microtomy, 3 staining modules and the coverslipper. All reagents are packaged so that there is no dumping or filling containers. Each reagent can be loaded directly on the machine. Waste goes directly from the machine into the drain, eliminating waste disposal fees. The HE600 does not use alcohol. The HE600 does not use distilled (DI) water, which prevents complete shut-down of staining operations when the DI water to the lab is turned off.

This synopsis announcement is being issued for information purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or request for competitive proposals. If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify its interest and capability to the contract specialist within three (3) calendar days of this publication by contacting Jerry L Mann via e-mail at jerry.mann@va.gov. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. This announcement closes 9 January 2019 at 0200PM EDT. Those interested firms must indicate whether they are large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) or woman owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned. Respondents who submit proprietary data shall clearly mark the data with appropriate markings. The Government will not pay for any information submitted as a result of this synopsis. This synopsis shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

<SOLNBR>DM-UFS-FY19
<RESPDATE>011919
<CONTACT>Douglas A. Medcalf, Contract Specialist, Email douglas.a.medcalf.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), is issuing this notice of Intent to Award an out of scope contracting modification on a Sole Source basis. This is not a request for proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the government to pay for costs incurred from the preparation and/or submission of data in response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a sole source out of scope contract modification to Adnet, Inc. This modification is initiated due to issues with the Government provided legacy database. The major cause of this delay resulted from the legacy database being structurally inadequate to support the required upgrades as defined in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>This requirement is for the direct support of ongoing US Army Medical Material Development Activity efforts to maintain and modernize internal product planning, programming and budgeting databases. The Government conducted a detailed analysis of the legacy database's structure and formatting with Adnet, Inc. after the Contractor had sufficient knowledge of the system. During the analysis it was found that the current structure included numerous tables and data elements that were not used. It was determined that the logic (relationship) between tables was incomplete or erroneous. Based on the analysis it was determined that a complete redesign was necessary to be able to maintain current functionality and to add the additional functionality required.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract modification is the continuation of development, maintenance and upgrades through system stabilization under contract W81XWH-16-C-0036. Specifically, this modification will include the following:</p>
<p>a. Deployment of a redesigned current capability (current capability is defined as system function as of 1 January 2018) by implementing the design, development, test, and documentation of a new SQL database for the USAMMDA Financial System (UFS); the design, programming, testing, and documentation of a new web enabled interface for the updated database; maintenance of the current (legacy) UFS functionality during the development effort for the new database and interface; and transitioning data from the legacy database to the new database and interface and test the systems in parallel to ensure there is no gap in functionality.</p>
<p>b. Design, programming, testing, deployment, and documentation of a capability to capture and report financial execution (obligation and disbursements) against a baseline.</p>
<p>c. Design, programming, testing, deployment, and documentation of a capability to capture acquisition data and Army and Defense Health Program Objective Memoranda.</p>
<p>This modification will enable the USAMMDA UFS database effort to continue without additional schedule lapse. Adnet, Inc. has the unique background and in depth knowledge of the legacy database and web interface from over a year of maintenance and modification. No other contractor has the in depth knowledge of the current database and web enabled interface; therefore, any other contractor would duplicate the cost already invested.</p>
<p>This sole source requirement is deemed to be available only from Adnet, Inc. Competing this requirement would result in substantial duplication of effort and costs and unacceptable delays. Database development requires consistency in the knowledge of the developers from initial design through deployment.</p>
<p>This out of scope modification will be issued on a sole source basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541511 and the small business size standard is $27.5 million. Any sources that believe they are eligible and capable of providing these services with the in depth knowledge of the current database and web enabled interface without duplicating the cost already invested must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence articulating the ability to provide the items outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the modification will be awarded without further remark.</p>
<p>This notice is provided solely as information to the marketplace.</p>
<p>CONTACT INFORMATION: Questions may be submitted to Mr. Doug Medcalf at douglas.a.medcalf.civ@mail.mil no later than 4:00PM EST on Saturday, 19 January 2019.</p>

Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations must be submitted as specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must show-<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the quoter;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken.

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work.

The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished.

Remodel Pharmacy for USP 800 (A/E)

Statement of Work

GENERAL GUIDANCE
Title of Project:  Remodel Pharmacy for United States Pharmacopeia (USP) 800 (A/E) in the Diagnostic & Testing Building at 2400 Canal St, Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care Facility in New Orleans, LA. 
Scope of Work:  Provide an Architectural & Engineering (A/E) Design Solution, including design drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates, for the following: (1) required renovation of the existing Pharmacy cleanroom areas in accordance with the latest edition of USP 800 for the aseptic compounding of both non-hazardous and hazardous, low and medium risk compounded sterile products; (2) build out of a new supplemental Pharmacy clean room or segregated compounding area in accordance with the latest edition of USP 800, located in a nearby mechanical space, to be used while the existing clean room is under construction.  The plan is to replace all associated components of the system in its entirety, as required by USP 800, to meet both primary and secondary engineering control requirements including, but not limited to, Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Structural, Controls, Communications, Specialty Work, Hazardous Materials Abatement and Fire Alarms/Protection.
Background: The Pharmacy Compounding area (clean room) at the New Orleans VAMC is currently not able to meet USP 800 regulations.  Significant construction will be needed in order to modify the compounding area to meet these regulations.  Compounding cannot take place in this area while construction is underway.  Therefore, a separate supplemental compounding area will need to be constructed in the nearby mechanical space that the Pharmacists can use while the main compounding area is under construction.  An A/E firm is required to produce stamped drawings that will then be used to award a separate construction contract.
Performance Period:    The Contractor (A/E, Architect Engineer) shall complete all designs and documents required under this SOW in 145 calendar days of issuance of the Notice-To-Proceed.   Work on site shall begin no more than ten (10) calendar days after issuance of the Notice-To-Proceed.

52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items 
ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS:


This is FAR Part 13 acquisition utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures.  The Government will
award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and other factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical Capability   The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of whether or not the offeror provided a signed statement certifying that the quote submitted meets the technical capability specified in the Statement of Work.  Technical Capability shall consist of meeting the technical requirements of the Statement of Work.

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to make a price reasonableness determination. Offers that do not meet the technical capability requirements of the Statement of Work shall not be selected regardless of price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(d)  All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the review in the most effective manner.  Specifically, the Government may first sort the quotes of all Offerors by price from lowest price to the highest.  Thereafter, the Government will review the Technical Capability of the lowest priced quote only.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to be acceptable and meets the requirements, the Government may make award to that Offeror without further reviews of the remaining Offerors  Technical Capability.  If the lowest priced Offeror s Technical Capability is determined to not meet the requirement, then the Government may review the Technical Capability next lowest priced quote, and so on, until the Government reaches a quote that is determined to meet the Technical Capability requirements.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Gauze Roll. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Gauze Roll products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Gauze Roll in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Gauze Roll will be established approximately April 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Gauze Roll. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Gauze Roll.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Gauze Roll. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $131,603. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($131,603) of the total volume in sales ($131,603). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment A00002 is to provide responses to Contractor questions.  The RFQ response date remains unchanged.


Contractor Questions and Responses:


1. P.4, (5) Evaluation Process   
a. Is the evaluation criteria strictly applicable to the contractor or can the solicitation requirements be satisfied by a subcontractor s abilities, expertise, and experience? 

RESPONSE:  The evaluation criteria includes the experience of the contractor and subcontractor to perform the work as follows:  Contractor shall demonstrate its experience to meet all requirements stated in the PWS.  If you are planning to sub-contract some or all of this work, please provide the name and address(s) of all subcontractor(s) (if applicable) and a description of their planned subcontracting effort.

b. Is it safe to assume if an offeror bids a per container price for this solicitation, that has been accepted as fair and reasonable per the GSA Schedule, and that the VA has recently awarded in other shredding contracts   that said price per container will be considered inherently fair and reasonable and therefore competitive?     

RESPONSE: No, this is an open market solicitation; price reasonableness shall be in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. 

c. Was an IGCE performed and if so on what was it based?

RESPONSE:  Yes, Independent Government Cost Estimates are for official use only and not for public disclosure.


2. P. 4, Evaluation Process 2. Past Performance and P.5, 3. Technical   will the VA consider awarding the contract to a company without relevant past performance in the business of sensitive document destruction?  If this is the case, how can the VA possibly conduct a REQUIRED Responsibility Determination evaluation if the awarded contractor has no past experience or any expertise whatsoever in performing the work required by the contract?

RESPONSE:  Award will be made to the best value, as determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.    A prospective contractor shall not be determined responsible or nonresponsible solely on the basis of a lack of relevant performance history (FAR 9.104-1).

3. P. 5, (x)   if we are currently registered in SAM is it necessary to provide anything further than noting that fact?

RESPONSE:  No

4. P.5, (xi) - will assessments of the winning Contractor s compliance to Limitations on Subcontracting requirements be performed? If not, then how will the VA KNOW the winning contractor is in compliance with this law? If the VA does not evaluate and monitor this requirement, then the VA is running the risk of a Qui Tam Lawsuit after the first twelve months of this contract.

RESPONSE: No, it is not anticipated that the total contract amount will be greater than the simplified acquisition threshold of $250K.  In accordance with 13 CFR 125.6 - In order to be awarded a full or partial small business set-aside contract with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, a small business concern must agree that: it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 50% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.  

5. P.8, 2.1    for pricing purposes at the VAMC should we use the upper range of the totes (30-40) and consoles (30-35)? 

RESPONSE:  This is a firm fixed price contract; the contractor shall provide a fixed price for up to 40 totes and 35 consoles. 

6. P.9, 2.1   for the VAMC outer buildings and for the Bennington CBOC, could the pickup schedule be changed to bi-weekly? This allows servicing to fall on the same day of the week and therefore lessens confusion around scheduling as well as invoicing.
RESPONSE:  Yes, the contractor can pick up bi-weekly

7. P.9, 2.1.1   if the final destruction occurs on site, should the Final Certificate of Destruction be the same as the Certificate of Destruction provided weekly? 
RESPONSE:  Final destruction (pulping) is completed off site and the requirement is the contractor is to provide a Final Certificate of Destruction.

8. P.17, 4. Liquidated Damages for Data Breach   if there is a data breach, how does the VA determine the number of people affected? 
RESPONSE:  The breach will be investigated by the privacy officer. 

9. P.25   what is the specific job on the Wage Rate Tables that is being applied for our workers on this contract? We need to know in order to be in compliance with the 1965 SCA, and we cannot accomplish this unless you tell us specifically which job category to use. Will assessments for compliance with the SCA of 1965 be conducted? 

RESPONSE:  Service Contract Labor Standards Wage Determinations were provided with the solicitation.  FAR 52.222-41 ( c ) (2) -  If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). 
The Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, is responsible for compliance/disputes concerning labor standards.

10. Is there a current contract for the work being solicited? If so, please provide that awarded contract number (NOT the incumbent GSA contractor number). Also please provide the name of the incumbent contractor and the contract amount. 

RESPONSE:  Yes, the requirement was split into two contracts as follows:
VA241-14-F-1928 (WRJ CBOCS)  Shred This Inc (SECURESHRED) -  Awarded in the amount of $65,260.20 (total) for the Base and Four Option Years.
VA241-14-F-0113  (White River Junction - Shred This Inc (SECURESHRED)   The contract amount total is $106,950 for the Base and Four Option Years. 

11. Is the level of effort being performed under the current contract fundamentally the same as what will be required to fulfill #36C24119Q0003? 
RESPONSE:  Yes

12.  Is there a minimum shred size necessary for the documents being shredded?
RESPONSE: All shred size must meet NAIID AAA Certification standards.

13.  Will the containers be delivered by VA personnel to the truck for shredding or will we have to retrieve each bin from its location.?
RESPONSE: The WRJ VAMC has a designated space for pickup in the basement of Building 31 and each outer building as a designated location for pickup. 

14. Has this job been awarded in the past? What was the dollar amount awarded and contract length of service?  
RESPONSE: Yes, see response to #10

15.  At the White River Junction VA Medical can we get more specific on the number of totes and consoles to help with a more competitive quote? It states approx. number, if we quote we would have to quote on the higher number verses actual.
RESPONSE: This is a firm fixed price contract; the contractor shall provide a fixed price for up to 40 totes and 35 consoles.

16. I am hoping to find out if there is an incumbent contractor currently performing these services or if this is a new requirement.  If there is an incumbent, could you please provide the contract number?
RESPONSE: See the response to Question #10

The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)/HBCK is seeking qualified sources to perform software development services by providing all tasks required for the maintenance, sustainment, and enhancement of the Global Adaptive Planning-Collaborative Information Environment 2.0 (GC2.0) software application. Tasks may include, but are not limited to, program management, system and software engineering, automated and manual testing, configuration management, cyber security, database management, quality assurance, and on-site customer support. The intent is for software development processes employed to allow for rapid, high quality, continuous software deliveries (e.g. Agile software development methodologies). The GC2.0 contract is being contemplated as a base, with four option years, and an overall contract value of less than $49M.</p>
<p>The Contractor must possess and maintain a TOP SECRET (TS) level facility clearance, and personnel providing on-site support may also be required to possess a TS Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance. Additionally, most software development will occur within the Contractor's facility, therefore an accredited SECRET level development lab, and the ability to store SECRET level information will be required. Bi-weekly software integration will occur at the Government facility, to include checkout and testing on the classified networks.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services which has a small business size standard of $27.5M. A small business firm competing as a prime contractor must be able to perform at least 50% of the total requirement within its own company (reference FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting).</p>
<p><strong>B. GC2.0 DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong>GC2.0 supports a real-time, net-centric, federated planning capability that integrates operational information and creates an automated "Courses of Action" suite the National Command Authority (NCA) assesses to weigh appropriate responses. As an inherent part of this capability, GC2.0 integrates external situational awareness data with planning data in order to present a view of the current operational environment.</p>
<p>GC2.0 provides global planners (National, Strategic, and Operational levels) a user-definable set of workspaces that can be process-structured for data, information and services orchestration. The planning workspaces support collaborative, web-based joint planning on multiple security enclaves for rapid development and maintenance of "living plans", and when necessary, the dynamic transition of integrated courses of action (COAs) to execution.</p>
<p>GC2.0 is part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Program office, which is an operational information technology system of systems (SoS) spanning multiple security enclaves to support strategic leadership decision making and to provide operational war planning and analysis capabilities for USSTRATCOM missions. ISPAN consists of two components, in which GC2.0 is one of them.</p>
<p>Joint Requirements and Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 016-09 established ISPAN as the Department of Defense (DOD) Program of Record for Combatant Commander (CCDR)/strategic level joint COA development. In practice, the COA development process is a subset of joint planning, is doctrine-based, and is applicable across the planning spectrum for both campaign/contingency and crisis planners. Planning outputs include presentations during the process (e.g. briefings), outputs at the end (e.g. documents), and situational awareness throughout (e.g. "dashboard" style information display of the operational environment). GC2.0 will reuse and refine valuable parts of the existing planning functions to support new mission areas, with reengineering to increase speed and efficiency at the user interface. One recent implementation of this approach is the Dashboard capability, which allows users to construct flexible situational awareness views through the addition of customizable gadgets to a canvas. These gadgets provide connections to authoritative data sources and the GC2.0 planning environment, with visualization in multiple forms. Enhancing the Dashboard capability to provide more gadget types, more data sources, and better performance is expected to be a major focus of this sustainment effort. This makes the system's planning capabilities equally useful for fusing and presenting current operations situational awareness information. A subset of customers utilizes the operational environment view (a.k.a. dashboards) exclusively.</p>
<p>As part of the operational environment view, external data is consumed through a variety of methods, including web services, RSS feeds, KML/KMZ files, Common Route Definition (CRD) files, etc. Incremental enhancements of this capability is necessary to maintain the system's cybersecurity posture, ensure the code base remains supportable, and provide additional enhancement and development capabilities, to include scaling the system larger and smaller for a wider user base.</p>
<p>GC2.0 will continue to evolve to support an open, flexible, scalable, and extensible architecture that is standards-based, compatible and interoperable with the Global Information Grid (GIG), along with its existing and emerging systems and programs. At the conclusion of current efforts, the system will have completed one major update to remove technology at or near obsolescence. Additional COTS and FOSS updates are expected. The code base is comprised of approximately 200,000 source lines of code; approximately half custom code and half open source. It is primarily Java, JavaScript, and HTML. It utilizes an Angular user interface, Oracle database, Oracle WebLogic application servers, Oracle Service Bus, and Apache web servers, operating in a virtual machine environment. Other FOSS products incorporated include LeafletJS, GeoTools, TinyMCE, docx4j, Hazelcast, JQuery, JQuery UI, Spring, Hibernate, DropWizard, Docker, and neo4j. It exchanges data with external systems using a variety of web services, some of which utilize the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise Messaging 4.0 (EM4) service. Infrastructure and application code is installed, configured, and deployed using Ansible. Code quality is monitored using a variety of products, including SonarQube and Fortify. The development environment will be expected to utilize Confluence, Jira, Jenkins, Maven, Protractor, and Selenium, among other products.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Life Raft Assembly is comprised of a 46 man life raft and an emergency equipment kit all in an aluminum container. Each life raft assembly measures approximately 36 inches x 18 inches x 18 inches and weighs approximately 200 pounds. The assemblies are preloaded against the longerons and fuselage skins to 1000 pounds by the deployment cable. The requirement is to support the assemblies during removal and installation due to the weight and locations of the life raft assemblies. Also it must be able to secure it suspend and provide control of the assemblies from the airframes within the limited space between the fuel lines and environmental ducts.

The Basic is for Qty of 4 each (includes first article), Test Plan (1 LO), and Test Report (1 LO). The 3-1 year Options are based on Qty range of 1 to 4 each.<br /><br />The sonic bondmaster (staveley pn 9622062, serd 110001) along with the included probes and cables constitute the equipment required to accomplish most inspections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the equipment calibration a reference standard is used to set up the instrument for the inspection. The display on the sonic bondmaster is adjusted to provide the sensitivity necessary to distinguish a non-bond signal from a good bond signal. Within the bondmaster there are four methods of inspection. They are the impulse pitch/catch test, swept pitch/catch test, the mechanical impedance analysis (Mia) test, and the resonance test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each performs a different test using the same or different probes which are included with the parent instrument. Swept pitch/catch testing uses a dual element probe that operates at a low frequency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One element transmits an acoustic wave into the structure while the other element receives back a plate wave traveling across the structure surface. The returned signals are processed and the difference between the effects of good and bad bonds is analyzed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the plate or lamb waves are attenuated by the bond between the face sheet and the core, these signals will be small in a bonded region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The waves travel in the skin with very little attenuation (caused by the core) producing a much larger signal pattern in an unbonded region.<br /><br />Impulse pitch/catch testing also uses a dual-element probe, but operates at a higher frequencies (ultrasonic range) than the swept pitch/catch method.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, the pulse length of the transmitted signal is shorter than the swept pitch/catch method.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One element is pulsed with a short single frequency burst of energy directed through the material being inspected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The other element, which is positioned a predetermined distance away in contact with the inspection surface, receives the sound propagating across the part surface.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Attenuation is caused by the same thing that affects the swept pitch/catch method above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wave phase and amplitude are analyzed for comparative differences to determine the bond quality. The Mia test method uses a single tipped dual element probe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A drive element generates audible sound waves and receiver element detects the changes in material stiffness caused by disbonds between the skin and core structure.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 03 is to provide answers to the following questions received from Industry:
<p><br />1. Question: For the opportunities marked for the OASIS contract, will you please confirm which, if any, are coming to OASIS Small Business (rather than OASIS Unrestricted)?</p>
<p>Answer: The Government's decision to utilize OASIS Small Business or OASIS Unrestricted will be based upon the results of market research. Responses to this RFI will be used as market research to refine the future S3I contractual approach and develop the acquisition strategy to satisfy potential requirements. Industry will be notified of the Government's intent once the PWS and acquisition strategy for these requirements are finalized.</p>
<p>2. Question: Are the RFI responses limited to 10 pages per each PWS?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the response is limited to 10 pages per PWS requirement.</p>

<DESC><p>Technology Call for the 2020 Maneuver Support, Sustainment, and Protection Integration Experiments (MSSPIX 20).</p>
<p>1. Background. The Maneuver Support, Sustainment, &amp; Protection Integrated Experiment (MSSPIX) campaign of experimentation follows the ARCIC Live Prototype Assessment (ALPA) guidance. MSSPIX provides a centralized experimentation and analysis process for technologies which provide desired capabilities, verifies critical operational data and makes recommendations for further development and additional improvements based on the analysis. These experiments will inform future capability requirements in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) that will directly align with the Army Modernization Priorities and each supporting Cross-Functional Teams. The ALPA effort offers four ARCIC Live Experimentation (ALE) venues, Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE), Maneuver Fires Integrated Experiment (MFIX), Cyber Quest (CQ) and MSSPIX. These venues are described in Appendix H as a means to help guide proposed technologies to the most appropriate venue.</p>
<p>2. Intent. In accordance with the ALPA FY19/20/21 Planning Guidance, the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) and Sustainment Center of Excellence (SCoE) will host MSSPIX 2020 to examine Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capabilities and concepts designed to address experiment objectives for Maneuver Support, Sustainment and Protection. Defeating capable enemies in the future requires Army maneuver forces enabled by Maneuver Support and Sustainment equities in all five domains - Land, Air, Cyberspace, Space and Maritime.</p>

<p>Question: <br />3.2.3.11 Red Hat Operating System Installation and Configuration<br />We are curious why the Navy is limiting competition for the Linux Operating Systems by specifying only RHEL. Linux is open source software.</p>
<p>Answer: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system (OS) requested is desired to ensure the capability, fit and compatibility of the Linux high performance computing (HPC) Cluster Computer with the pre-existing cluster system currently used on the existing network. Only RHEL will ensure desired capabilities are compatible with pre-existing software in form, fit and function. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for this follow-on effort and is required to support the existing software build.</p>

<DESC>Note: This Request for Information / Sources Sought Notice is the most up to date. A previous notice was posted on 12/14/2018. 

Request for Information (RFI) / Sources Sought Notice 
Subject to FAR clause 52.215-3 entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Notice for information and planning purposes for qualified and experienced sources to provide inspections of static aircraft on loan from the U.S. Navy to ensure the aircraft is Safe for Display throughout multiple geographical areas. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  It is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than to gain the information requested, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.
 The Government has determined that these supplies and services are commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101.  Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI / Sources Sought Notice.

Background
The National Naval Aviation Museum (NNAM), part of the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), has custody of approximately 1,149 aircraft; of which, approximately 948 are currently loaned throughout the country. Inspections were performed on approximately 9% of the loaned static display aircraft; and, of those inspected, 49% were found to have HAZMAT/HAZWASTE (i.e. varying amounts of fuels, oils, hydraulic fluids, radioactive materials, CADS, etc) which required abatement. NHHC does not have the sufficient number of skilled personnel on board, nor the mobile equipment to execute required tasks over multiple geographic locations.

Scope
The scope of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to inspect, assess, and render them safe for public display.
All repairs (except minor repairs which include patches for small holes, missing fasteners, safety wires, etc.) require authorization by NHHC.  Any reconditioning, repairing, and refinishing (other than minor repairs described above) requires a separate scope of work.  The Government requires a contractor to furnish all tools, support equipment, commercially available computer applications (i.e. Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, photo-editors, etc), labor and materials, required to inspect and make aircraft Safe for Display. Any potential contract resulting from this RFI / Sources Sought Notice is anticipated to be a single and/or multiple award, commercial, firm-fixed-price (FFP), definite-delivery, definite-quantity type contract.
 See the draft (PWS) posted with this notice for additional details.

Place of Performance (Site Locations)
Numerous locations throughout the United States and Hawaii with a focus on inspecting the remainder of the South East. 

Industry Day

NAVSUP FLC Norfolk is sponsoring an unclassified Pre-Solicitation Conference (Industry Day) conducted by the Naval Heritage History Command (NHHC) for a contract vehicle that will inspect, assess, return and/or maintain the material condition of static display aircraft in as near original configuration as possible, and render them safe for public display. The purpose of the event is to inform industry of program requirements, anticipated acquisition strategy, competition timeline, and to provide a networking opportunity.
 

The conference will be held on 15 January 2019, at the Washington Navy Yard, Museum Education Center, Washington, DC from 1000 AM to approximately 1500 PM.  

To attend the industry day please register by emailing Mrs. Caitlin King at caitlin.king@navy.mil and Mr. William Lucenta at william.lucenta@navy.mil no later than 1700 Eastern time on 08 January 2019. 

NAICS Code
The NAICS code for this requirement is anticipated to be 488190, Aircraft inspection services, with a current size standard of $32.5 million.  The product service code (PSC) is P200, Salvage of Aircraft.

Period of Performance 
TBD



Capabilities Statement
This is a market research tool.  The input provided will help the Navy ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of potential businesses.
 If you are an interested business, FLCN appreciates your assistance in providing a capabilities statement addressing the items below.

<DESC>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1 the Sioux Falls Veterans Administration Health Care System (SFVAHCS) has determined that the procurement of Furniture Moving, Installation and Storage services for the Omaha Veterans Administration Health Care System, hereinafter referred to as OVAHCS located in Omaha, NE, meets the criteria established for other than full and open competition. It is further determined that unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition due to substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition for this specialized service.  This limitation on competition is justified and supported by the attached sole source document.
