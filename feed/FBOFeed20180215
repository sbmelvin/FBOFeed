Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12 and Part 13.5. No solicitation will be issued.

Responses are to be received within 10 days of this notice. No telephone calls are being accepted.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), intends to negotiate and award on a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) basis. A purchase order will be one year firm-fixed price (plus two option years) awarded to CAST: Council for Agricultural Science and Technology of Ames, IA for conduct an annual crosscut analysis to determine the amount of funds that are expended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) on biotechnology research. This crosscut analysis involves Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who read and evaluate in excess of 1,000 projects from the Current Research Information System (CRIS, http://cris.csrees.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=crisassist.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK) to determine the percentage of biotechnology in each project. Anticipated Date of Award: 04/01/2018.</p>
<p>The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) is a nonprofit organization primarily responsible for assembling, interpreting, and communicating credible science-based information on a regional and international level (https://www.cast-science.org/).  CAST is composed of scientific societies and individual members who join as students, companies, and nonprofit organizations. Due to this, CAST has a strong network of biotechnology experts, in addition to the organization's work of addressing issues in agriculture among other topics. For instance, CAST addresses issues of animal sciences, food sciences and agricultural technology, plant and soil sciences, and plant protection sciences with inputs from economists, social scientists, toxicologists or plant pathologists and entomologists, and legal experts. There are many agencies that provide expertise on individual topics and there is no other single agency that covers all these aspects.  CAST is the only qualified organization to supply the required SMEs for this integral service of specialized nature. The nature of CAST's non-profit status also enables an objective crosscut analyses of NIFA funding in biotechnology due to no perceived conflict of interests.</p>

<SUBJECT>QF-16 Radar Cross Section (RCS) Measurement

<CONTACT>Patricia A. Hicks, Contract Specialist, Phone 8508830873, Email patricia.hicks@us.af.mil - Joseph P. O'Gallagher, Contracting Officer, Phone 8508833376, Email joseph.ogallagher@us.af.mil
<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) - QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) - The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Testing and Training Division, Aerial Targets Branch, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL intends to award a sole source contract to Boeing Company, Defense, Space &amp; Security, 6200 J S McDonnell Blvd, St. Louis, MO, 63134-1939 to conduct Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements of a new (repainted) QF-16 mission configuration required by the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E). This contract will provide the measurement data and analysis needed to validate the new QF-16 mission configuration (hereafter &lsquo;repainted') RCS model required by DOT&amp;E. The Contractor will be responsible for conducting the RCS measurements at a Contractor-provided test facility certified under the National RCS Measurement Facilities Certification Program. It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded 1st Quarter FY19. The period of performance will be 8 months from award through final contract data requirements list (CDRL) delivery.
<p>The RCS measurement must be sufficient to support validation of an RCS model. Historical data (weapon programs lessons learned) established that high-confidence model validation can only be accomplished through the use of whole-body, far-field measurements that account for all of the targets spatially distributed radar scattering centers. The validated model is used in an ordered process that applies high fidelity weapon simulations and live fire test results to predict real-world weapon performance, particularly, weapon lethality as required under Title 10 United States (US) Code 2366. The Government has determined that the only way to prevent any adverse impact to critical mission activities that could result from availability of threat representative full scale aerial targets in support of Title 10 Live Fire and Lethality operational testing is to issue a contract to the incumbent vendor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 488190 with a size standard of $32.5M. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This NOCA neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government to any specific acquisition approach. This NOCA is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment to a contract by the Government. POC is Mr. Joseph P. O'Gallagher at 207 West D Avenue, Suite 214, Building 349, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6853 or at joseph.ogallagher@us.af.mil. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Lt Col Kenneth Decker, AFLCMC/AQ-AZ, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433. He may be contacted by email at kenneth.decker.1@us.af.mil, phone number (937) 255-5512.

20.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer James Headington, 405-734-1984, James.Headington.1@us.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>Better Characterizing the Burden of Acute Gastroenteritis within an Integrated Health Care Delivery System
<SOLNBR>2018-19748
<RESPDATE>030218
<CONTACT>Maria S Shamburger, Email HEG9@cdc.gov
<DESC><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/ID/VSDB, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research (KPNW-CHR), 3800 N. Interstate Ave Portland, OR 97227, to conduct a retrospective analysis to better understand factors related to acute gastroenteritis (AGE) within an integrated health care delivery system.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The proposed acquisition aims to build upon a previous project recently conducted between Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research (KPNW-CHR) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the previous project, active surveillance of medically-attended acute gastroenteritis (MAAGE) was conducted over two and a half years in the KPNW catchment area of Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington. The objectives of the MAAGE project were to obtain age-stratified incidence estimates of medically-attended disease, assess the seasonality, and better characterize the clinical characteristics and epidemiological profile of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and norovirus infections.</p>
<p>It was possible to achieve these objectives due to many factors uniquely available through the KPNW collaboration. First, the KPNW membership is large and highly representative of the health plan's coverage area. Access to this population proved instrumental to recruitment efforts and the validity of the MAAGE project estimates. Second, KPNW has a dedicated clinical research team in the Center for Health Research (CHR). The CHR is an academic-level research institute with access to data and resources not commonly available at other medical institutions. Specifically, the CHR has a designated team of researchers and IT personnel, access to the KPNW electronic health records (EHR) database, and the ability to recruit study participants from the entire KPNW membership. Third, KPNW has a close working relationship with the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) who are experienced in norovirus testing and surveillance using CDC protocols. This relationship enabled KPNW to coordinate MAAGE stool sample testing at OSPHL with high confidence in the validity of sample testing results. More recently CDC and KPNW-CHR continued this collaboration with a one year study of community acute gastroenteritis (CAGE), which assessed the incidence of AGE in the community, asymptomatic prevalence rates of enteric viruses, and healthcare utilization practices of KPNW members. The proposed activities will build on MAAGE and CAGE, and thus require many of the same factors that enabled MAAGE and CAGE to succeed. First, the requested supplemental data needs to be drawn from the same highly representative population as MAAGE and CAGE. Those studies demonstrated that the KPNW membership is an ideal population. KPNW members were highly receptive to participating and displayed higher-than-expected survey completion and stool submission. Therefore, continuing to collaborate with KPNW will provide access to the same representative KPNW membership. Second, the KPNW staff have gained expertise in conducting active surveillance within their membership. No other researchers currently possess the knowledge or have the experience to conduct such a project within this target population. Moreover, a tremendous amount of project infrastructure was developed during MAAGE and CAGE that is specific to the KPNW health system. Fortunately, the existing recruitment and tracking systems, survey instruments, and databases can be quickly modified to fit the supplemental project needs. Selecting a different contractor will require much more investment of time and money to reconstruct these tools that could be saved through continuing the KPNW collaboration. Third, this project will benefit from the close working relationship between KPNW and OSPHL. OSPHL has demonstrated the ability to efficiently and reliably test nearly 4000 stool samples for MAAGE and CAGE. Additional surveillance and testing of samples in the same laboratory will help ensure appropriate comparability of results from MAAGE and CAGE studies. Additionally, the logistical system established between KPNW and OSPHL has been tested and proven. As a result, many obstacles common to projects of this nature will be avoided due to lessons learned during MAAGE and CAGE. In summary, access to the KPNW membership and their EHR data, KPNW staff expertise, the existing MAAGE infrastructure, and the proven collaboration between KPNW and OSPHL, make KPNW uniquely poised to efficiently and successfully fulfill the needs of the proposed study.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Contracting Officer, Reference 2018-19748, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Maria Shamburger, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 236220 General Contractors   Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standard is $36.5 million.  The solicitation will be issued as a 100% set-aside to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a firm fixed-price, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a non-commercial item.  

The construction IDIQ contracts shall provide general construction work at an indefinite quantity by placing individual task orders with the contractors within minimum and maximum limitations of $2,000.00 - $500,000.00 per task order.  The maximum contract value for each IDIQ contract is $5,000,000.00 for the base year and $5,000,000.00 per each exercised option year.  The contractual vehicle will be a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  The minimum guarantee for each IDIQ is $2,000.00 per contract awardee which meets the FAR 16.5 requirement.

The prospective contractors must fully demonstrate their abilities as well as specific expertise in concurrently managing a variety of construction projects, in a manner that complies with all applicable regulations and laws and within the time frame required.  The government will evaluate all firms using source selection procedures in order to determine the firm s experience in providing the type of work, experience of key personnel, past performance and quality, subcontracting, and schedule and cost control.  After award is made, the contractor s performance under individual task orders will be monitored both on site and through periodic performance evaluations as required.  The performance standards of the construction services being acquired are published via specifications, drawings, and statutory contractual requirements which flow from the basic IDIQ contract to each issued task order and they relate to the need by virtue of the fact the aforementioned statutory requirements are established in regulation, directives, law, etc.

The Solicitation shall state that Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government may award to other than the lowest price offerors or other than the highest technically rated offerors in order to select the contractors whose offers represent the best value to the Government (FAR 15.101-1).

Technical Risks. The Government's technical risks will be reduced through the selection process. The prospective firms must fully demonstrate their capabilities as well as specific expertise in the construction skills required. The Government's risk will also be reduced by quality assurance reviews performed by the Government s technical personnel. If the contractor's performance is less than satisfactory, there is no obligation to place work with the contractor after the guaranteed minimum stated in the contract is satisfied. This provides a strong incentive for the contractor to provide consistently high quality construction. The risk to the Government is essentially limited to the minimum guaranteed amount for 
the IDIQ award. There is no obligation for the government to pay more than the minimum guarantee.

Scheduling Risks. Scheduling risks are directly impacted by a firm's ability to manage effectively. 
Any other scheduling risks will be minimized significantly by closely screening the firm's corporate 
structure, experience, and technical capabilities/experience of the individuals to be involved with the resultant contract during the selection process to ensure that acceptable performance has been demonstrated and the planned management team is fully qualified. 

The successful performance for each task order will be evaluated through the use of the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), performance evaluations and close monitoring of each task order by the Government's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Contractors will become familiar with the government process and way of doing business, as the IDIQ progresses.  

Market research has been conducted in the VetBiz Registry and the Small Business Administration (SBA) website for construction contractors for NAICS codes 236220. Searches of the SBA and VetBiz websites yielded the following information: 

INDIANA:   VetBiz: 98    SBA: 26
MICHIGAN:   VetBiz: 107    SBA: 59
OHIO:   VetBiz: 123    SBA: 48
Based on market research, there is a reasonable expectation of receiving two or more responses from responsible SDVOSB contractors for each location. Therefore, the acquisition shall be a total set-aside for SDVOSB. 
The Government contemplates award of approximately 10 Firm Fixed Price IDIQ JOCs, resulting in Firm Fixed Price Task Order Awards. Coefficients will be established for the base year contract and each exercised option year. The unit price book, RS Means will be updated annually.  

Source-Selection procedures: Awards will be made based on technical and past performance evaluation factors and price. The solicitation will state that Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. A best value determination will be made based on those evaluation factors. A technical evaluation team will be established and the source selection plan will be distributed to the team. The solicitation will clearly identify the evaluation factors, as well as the evaluation criteria. The technical evaluation will determine Contractors' capabilities.

The flow of source selection evaluation will be in the following order: 
1) technical proposal without pricing 
2) past performance 
3) pricing data 

Contractors will be allowed to propose on multiple locations   separate proposals will be required for each location being proposed. 

The government wishes to award multiple contracts.  Contractors who fail to show capability in their proposal may be eliminated in the procurement process. Negotiations under FAR Part 15 will permit the government to hold discussions, as determined by the Contracting Officer, with offerors whose proposal may require additional information and resubmission in order to correctly reflect their capabilities and thereby qualify for award of a contract.

A Pre-Proposal conference and site visit will be announced in the Solicitation.  Details for registering for the conference will be available in the solicitation.  Interested contractors are encouraged to attend and should register in accordance with the requirements to be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation closing date is to be determined.  Actual dates and times will be identified in the solicitation.  All information, amendments and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted at the following we page:  http://www.fbo.gov.

DISCLAIMER:  The official plans and specification are located on the official government web page and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source.  Amendment, if/when issued will be posted to http://www.fbo.gov/ for electronic downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.  Websites are occasionally inaccessible due to various reasons.  The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offerors inability to access the documents posted on the referenced web pages.

Other contractors have begun to understand the value of a staring system, but no one produces a competitive product at this time. It should be made clear that there are a number of 2-D LADARS that can image targets, but do not actually extract range for every pixel on the target.  The current camera (Tiger Cub) was produced by ASC using their proprietary Focal Plane Array (FPA). Since no other company can produce this large (128x128) a staring array, there is no way a substitute array could be retrofitted into the Tiger Cub camera.   In addition the Tiger Cub has a unique interface to the FPA which would not be compatible with other smaller staring arrays.

<DESC>Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support Mechanicsburg intends to solicit and award a base five-year requirements contract for the repair of approximately 475 ea, NSN 7H 5960-01-447-7074, Electron Tubes, P/N 6155775.

This action is being negotiated on a sole source basis with Communications and Power Industries, LLC, (CPI) in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1.  CPI is the designer and manufacturer of this item.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not possess or cannot provide the data necessary to perform the required repairs of the item.
  Repair of the existing item requires a license to CPIs proprietary data and methods.  Further, any new design would have to be approved by the Government design agent, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.  The time required for approval of a new design is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval; thus, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT SF 330 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY, NOR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS REQUEST. THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
CONTRACT INFORMATION
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 5 Office is seeking Architect-Engineering services to support the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO). The Great Lakes Architect-Engineer Services (GLAES) contract will provide professional Architect-Engineer services to support contaminated sediment design activities, habitat restoration design/evaluation support, and contaminated sediment remedial oversight (see attached Statement of Work (SOW)).  
The GLAES contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act and implemented through the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 Architect-Engineer Services. A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. In accordance with FAR 36.209 Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms, no contract for the construction of a project shall be awarded to the firm that designed the project or its subsidiaries or affiliates, except with the approval of the head of the agency or authorized representative.
EPA intends to award one (1) Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a maximum contract value of $25,000,000 and an ordering period of five (5) years. The guaranteed minimum value of this requirement is $100,000. Each individual task order shall be separately negotiated based on the A-E effort involved. Task Orders will be issued as firm fixed price and/or time and materials. In no event will the value of the total task orders issued under this contract exceed the maximum contract value.   
This requirement is subject to full and open competition. If a large business is selected for a contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, for the work it intends to subcontract. However, the plan is not required with the SF 330 package.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed priced GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) task order pursuant to FAR 8.405-2 for the requirement based on the application of FAR 83405-6(a)(1)(i)(B).  This hereby constitutes a synopsis of the options included in this requirement.  

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Simplex Grinnell.  The fire control system is proprietary to Simplex Grinnell; the Government lacks the required rights to the programming to develop a Full and Open competitive procurement for this effort. Except for replacing the entire system, which will be competed once the system becomes obsolete, developing a full and open competitive approach for this effort is impracticable. 

Market research revealed SimplexGrinnell is the manufacturer and distributor of the fire alarm systems, and SimplexGrinnell district offices are the ONLY factory trained and certified service providers for the 4100-series fire alarm system.  The 4100, 4010 and 4020 series Fire Alarm Systems are microprocessor-based systems, which operate on a life safety software program, which is proprietary to SimplexGrinnell.  

While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The Government understands Simplex Grinnell is the only vendor that can provide the requested fire alarm maintenance service to their current system. However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to shane.galles@va.gov within three calendar days after publication of this notice. Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

THIS IS A PRESOLICIATION NOTICE   A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WILL BE POSTED ON OR ABOUT February 16, 2018
Kitchen Ceiling Addition, Miles City, MT
36C25918R0240
The VA Montana Healthcare System (hereinafter the  Agency ) has a requirement to construct a new 820 sqft suspended ceiling in the VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) located in Miles City, Montana.  The intent of this project is to effectively address a patient safety concern by concealing an exposed damaged kitchen ceiling with a new suspended ceiling.  
The intent of this project is to construct a new suspended ceiling approximately one foot lower than the hard-top kitchen ceiling. Due to moisture from a busted pipe, the existing hard top ceiling has permanent damage. The integrity of the ceiling material is ruined and the paint is peeling.  To limit the amount of infection control and patient disturbance, a complete demolish and replacement of the existing ceiling is not a desirable solution. The more suitable solution is to add an additional ceiling under the existing hard top ceiling. 
The height of the existing ceiling is approximately 8 9  . The ceiling covers an area of approximately 820 sqft. The new ceiling height must not be lower than the height of the cooler door. The height of the cooler door is about 7  high.  The new ceiling must be constructed to only allow enough clearance space for the light fixtures. The ceiling should be composed of 2x4 commercial kitchen ceiling panels, meets or exceeds USDA/FSIS guidelines and has 15/16   white painted steel suspension system. 
Further work is as indicated in the construction document and comprises the individually identified tasks as listed below.  
Adjust eight (8) fire suppression heads in accordance with new ceiling level.
Replace eight (8) 2 x4  fluorescent light fixtures with new 2 x2  LED CREE light fixtures at new ceiling level. 
Relocate exit sign and fire alarm strobe light.   
All work will be accomplished on the Miles City VA Medical Center campus as indicated in the SOW.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 with a small business size standard of $36.5M.  The magnitude of this project between $25,000 and $100,000.  This project will be 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, as stated below.
The POC for this project will be Joseph Wingfield.  He can be contacted through email at joseph.wingfield@va.gov.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Subject Matter Expert (SME) support of the Web Comprehensive Cost and Requirement (Web CCaR) system for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (DD 1423), the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet and the Customer List where services will be performed (see Appendix A of PWS). <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Attachments (PWS CDRL's and Capability Matrix) are included to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the AFLCMC and AFRL and the respondent's potential ability to meet the Government's requirements.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The requirements of this task are for the provision of Web CCaR application support for the unique funding, planning, reconciliation, execution and reporting requirements and interface capabilities with various Government systems and applications for activities associated with AFLCMC and AFRL organizations, as well as in-depth experience and expertise to quickly and accurately respond to the wide variety of financial tasks and unique formats required for detailed financial and program related reporting. Contractor personnel must have knowledge of Air Force financial, contracting, and program management procedures, understand the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process, and understand the Requirements &amp; Planning Council (R&amp;PC) process. Web CCaR SME must have the familiarity with operating web-based database programs, as well as be proficient in all Web CCaR applications.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The contractor shall provide functional support of the Web CCaR application. Web CCaR SME provides assistance and support to Web CCaR Administrators, needed to carry out Web CCaR administrative functions and Web CCaR functional tasks which include, but are not limited to, the following: set-up, configuration, daily operation and training of the Web CCaR application in direct support to AFLCMC and AFRL organizations. Web CCaR SME must have extensive knowledge of the following systems and how they interface with Web CCaR: General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS), Automated Business Services System (ABSS), Contract Writing Document Preparation (ConWrite); as well as other systems that do not directly interface with Web CCaR e.g., Commander's Resource Integration System (CRIS) and Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS). Web CCaR SME shall ensure that the Web CCaR application is properly tailored and configured to meet the unique requirements of the organization to include reimbursable Government accounting and various Business Management Review (BMR) chart configurations.&nbsp; </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This effort will require a current Secret Facility Clearance.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The Air Force anticipates utilizing a hybrid contract with Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Reimbursable CLINs. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be a base year and four (4) option years. A multi-year contract allows for reduced staff manpower to initiate and award. This also allows employment stability, i.e. able to sign employees to longer term contracts thus generating further efficiencies and best ensuring continuity in the support provided to the Government. Upon award of the option years, the same contractor is ready and able to deliver required services on day one without the need for transition time, or downtime, which again, creates efficiencies for the Government.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. <br /><br />Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. <br /><br />The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 6-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements, including the requirement for personnel to plan and part-mark 15 - 45 locations worldwide simultaneously and how the contractor will finance these operations. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone number, E-Mail Address, CAGE Code, Web Page URL, and Small business size certification, if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to AFLCMC/PZIT. Statements should be submitted no later than 21 November 2014 at 5pm EST.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach.

<SUBJECT>Intent to Sole Source - Tactical Scalable Mobile Ad-hoc Network (TSM) Waveform
<SOLNBR>W15P7T18R0014
<RESPDATE>030118
<CONTACT>Allison A Gregory, Phone 4438614970, Email allison.a.gregory2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 5.201, the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is synopsizing the following contract actions:
<p>1. The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements to TrellisWare Technologies, Inc. (CAGE: 1SBL7), 16516 VIA ESPRILLO Suite 300 San Diego, 92127-1708 for the procurement of the Tactical Scalable Mobile Ad-hoc Network (TSM) Waveform.</p>
<p>2. ACC-APG intends to add a requirement to current and future Non-Developmental Item (NDI) radio contracts within the Project Manager Tactical Radio (PM TR) portfolio for an item particular to one manufacturer, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 11.105 and the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The requirement is for the radios to operate the TSM waveform made by TrellisWare Technologies, Inc. (CAGE: 1SBL7), 16516 VIA ESPRILLO Suite 300 San Diego, CA 92127-1708.</p>
<p>3. ACC-APG is requesting information in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 205.205-71, DFARS 206.302-1(d), and DFARS Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI) 206.302-1(d), to determine whether companies other than TrellisWare Technologies, Inc. have similar waveform/software products that meet the agency's needs. The Government has determined it needs a terrestrial Line of Sight (LOS) networking radio waveform supporting IP networking (Layer 2 at a minimum) and Combat Net Radio (CNR) voice simultaneously.</p>
<p>Companies that have a networking waveform that they would like to bring to the Government's attention as a possible candidate to meet this networking waveform requirement should provide an information paper which addresses the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Is the waveform software defined and thus capable of being instantiated on NDI radio platforms? Can the waveform be ported to the following Army radios: AN/PRC-158, AN/PRC-155, AN/PRC-162, AN/PRC-148, AN/PRC-154, AN/PRC-117, AN/PRC-152, etc? Additionally, what standards does your waveform conform to which simplify porting of your waveform to NDI radios? Please share the standard hardware architecture your waveform requires, and any deviations it can work with as well. For example: a MIMO waveform which operates best with a radio architecture incorporating four full-duplex transceivers, but which can also work in SISO on a radio architecture with a single half-duplex transceiver.</p>
<p>b. Has the waveform been ported onto a radio platform that is not manufactured by the waveform designer? If yes, which radio manufacturer has ported your waveform and what is the radio's nomenclature?</p>
<p>c. Is your waveform capable of supporting SECRET and Below (SAB) traffic using NSA certified programmable embedded encryption, Suite A or B (provided by the NDI radio platform)?</p>
<p>d. Does the waveform operate on frequency bands of Ultra High Frequency (UHF) through S-Band (225 MHz-2600 MHz) at channel bandwidths of 1.2MHz and higher? Specifically, which operational bands can the waveform operate in and what channel bandwidths are available? <br /><br />e. Does your waveform operate without the need of any additional hardware beyond the hardware radio platform? Does your waveform require any additional hardware/communication infrastructure (i.e. cellular towers, legacy systems, additional devices) to be fully capable?</p>
<p>f. Will your waveform scale to operationally support a network of 130 nodes within a single 1.2MHz wide RF frequency channel? What is the unicast / broadcast throughput of your waveform for a network of this size? Please provide details on traffic profile, message completion rate, and latency for both cases.</p>
<p>g. How many seconds does a network of 130 nodes take to form (assuming all initialization data has been pre-loaded, and the radios powered off)? How long does a 130 node network that has split into two networks take to merge back into one network of 130 nodes? How long does it take a single node to join a network of 129 nodes?</p>
<p>h. Does your waveform network support simultaneous voice and data communications?</p>
<p>i. Does your waveform network support a minimum of 12 voice channels/call groups within a single 1.2MHz RF channel?</p>
<p>j. What Electronic Protection (EP) characteristics does your waveform contain? Please reference JP-3-13.1 for definition of Electronic Protection terms.</p>
<p>k. Is your waveform interoperable with TSM waveform at the Layer 2 network level?</p>
<p>l. Is your waveform comparable with TSM? If yes, explain your rationale. <br /><br />m. What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your waveform?</p>
<p>n. What additional information should the Government understand about your waveform?</p>
<p>o. Has your waveform been tested or fielded to any U.S. military users? Please provide POC and any supporting test reports or fielding after action reports.</p>
<p>p. Please explain if any of the above capabilities are not available today, but will become available in the future and when.</p>
<p><br />4. If your company can provide a waveform/software product that meets the aforementioned requirements, please provide an information paper which addresses the above. Submissions shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Verbal responses will not be considered. Responses shall be submitted in writing, via email, and shall not exceed 10 pages, 12 point font plus any additional pages addressing testing and fielding reports. Ensure individual files do not exceed 5MB. Interested vendors may identify their capabilities by responding to this requirement no later than 12:00 PM ET, Thursday March 1, 2018. Responses and/or questions concerning this requirement shall be submitted to Allison Gregory at Allison.a.gregory2.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to the CSFO II procurement website at: <a href="https://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/csfo2">https://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/csfo2</a> /; please reference this document for additional information about NASA's policies with respect to OCI issues.</p>
<p>Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the CSFO Follow-on will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues. This list is not all inclusive.<br /><br />&bull;	Assessment of ground-based hardware designs, analysis, and models developed for the JSC by Contractors, and Space Act Agreement Participants;<br /><br />&bull;	Assessment of new technology disclosures (aka "invention disclosures") including, for example, new and novel hardware, software, and processes;<br /><br />&bull;	Access to Government Sensitive or Privacy Act Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements or personal injury data and rates of other contractors;<br /><br />&bull;	Access to a Contractor, or Space Act Agreement Participant's proprietary information where said Contractor, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the CSFO Contractor;<br /><br />&bull;	Safety oversight for test and evaluation of hardware and procedures;<br /><br />&bull;	Safety surveillance of construction and facility operations, facility inspections, safety reviews of facility design and modification, and preliminary mishap investigations.<br /><br />These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the CSFO Follow-on contract:<br /><br />&bull;	Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the follow-on contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government procurement contract;<br /><br />&bull;	Potential impaired objectivity if the follow-on contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractors;<br /><br />&bull;	Potential impaired objectivity if the follow-on contractor or its subcontractors or related companies are responsible for assessing or performing safety and mission assurance for hardware or data generated by the follow-on contractor, its subcontractors, or related companies under another JSC contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or Space Act Agreement; or<br /><br />&bull;	Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA's preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA's evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to address the following questions:</p>
<p>1.	What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the CSFO II contract?<br /><br />2.	What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.<br /><br />3.	Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed CSFO II that were not identified in this RFI?<br /><br />4.	Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the CSFO II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential RFP?</p>
<p>NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each interested party's proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy. NASA's response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI may ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA's response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for CSFO follow-on in the future. Furthermore, NASA's response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP issued for the CSFO follow-on. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA's response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />RESPONSES</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide electronic responses limited to no more than 20 pages for your entire response, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font.</p>
<p>The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. The information received will not be released to the public, but may be used to refine requirements and develop the best approach for any follow-on contract strategy. Information used in such a manner may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as "Confidential", "Commercial" or "Financial Information" will be considered voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. To facilitate teaming arrangements, the Government intends to post the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents on the CSFO II website for this acquisition, unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  The Government will not pay for any information received and will not reimburse preparation costs related to this RFI.  No evaluations, results or responses will be issued to the interested parties, except as otherwise provided in Attachment 3, OCI.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website as well as the CSFO II procurement website. It is an interested party's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Steven Fletcher, Contracting Officer, at <a href="mailto:steven.d.fletcher@nasa.gov">steven.d.fletcher@nasa.gov</a> &nbsp;no later than 4:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, March 1, 2018. Please reference 80JSC18CSFOII in your response.</p>

<p>A. RFI #1: LVM-17-2661-0004 (Posted 04-27-17)<br />B. RFI #2: LVM-18-2661-4976</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is an RFI only. The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Small, HUBZone, Woman-Owned, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned or Large Business) relative to NAICS Code 541715. Responses to this RFI will be used by JPL to make appropriate Acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is an operating division of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), staffed with Caltech employees, and is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) under the sponsorship of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This RFI seeks to obtain information and assess respondent's core capabilities in the areas of the information system development lifecycle, including supporting roles of systems engineering, operations, data management and archive. The intent is to enable augmentation of the JPL workforce in support of both flight and non-flight activities. The anticipated effort would be utilizing an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity model with work orders.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />Provide the labor, computing equipment, tools, and office facilities necessary to perform tasks and services in support of JPL flight and non-flight projects. This includes, but is not limited to, the following core areas:</p>
<p>1. Perform all aspects of the software development lifecycle for local, distributed, embedded, back-end web systems, and flight system software, including deployment and configuration management. In addition:</p>
<p>a. Design and develop software and system architectures; <br />b. Design, develop, and test non/relational and object databases;<br />c. Design, develop, and test scientific algorithms;<br />d. Design, develop, and execute software validation and verification test plans.<br /> <br />2. With expertise in key engineering fields, perform design, analysis, and operational tasks in support of flight and non-flight projects. Tasks will include optimizing, preparing, and validating spacecraft and instrument command plans while meeting operational constraints; managing complex and high-volume data processing systems to meet quality, latency, and mean-time-between failure requirements; and operating non-flight and flight sub-systems. Such tasks will require interfacing other operational teams, project personnel, and science teams.</p>
<p>3. Perform systems engineering for flight and non-flight tasks. This includes, but is not limited to gathering and documenting requirements; developing operational scenarios; preparing schedules and cost estimates; performing complex trade studies and modeling/analysis for flight and ground systems; testing/validating flight and ground systems; defining work processes to improve operability; preparing technical documentation/reports; and participating in technical reviews.</p>
<p>4. Perform computer and information research in the areas of distributed computing, data management, intelligent search, data analytics, virtual reality, machine learning, and cyber security. Develop models and prototypes to demonstrate technology.</p>
<p>5. Design and develop technical documentation, and web-based science visualization tools in support of the project and science teams.</p>
<p>6. Provide end-user support to the JPL, science, and engineering communities in regards to data distribution, inquires/assistance concerning scientific data, end-user documentation, and communicating user needs back to developers.</p>
<p>7. All central management functions necessary to support the above shall include program management, cost control, financial management and reporting, procurement services; safety, health and environmental planning; IT security and physical security planning, government property management, export compliance, and administrative support.</p>
<p>If your company is interested and capable of providing this effort, JPL requests a concise response to the questions established under each tab in the attached Excel spreadsheet. There is no page limit on the responses; however all responses are required to be in the Excel spreadsheet format. Please include your (1) company name, (2) cage code, (3) contact information, and (4) business size classification based on the NAICS Code 541715 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER:<br />It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implies or otherwise, that JPL will solicit you for such procurement in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred by you in the furnishing this information. Prospective contractors are advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.</p>

<p>National Institutes of Health<br />NIH Clinical Center<br />Biomedical Translational Research Information Systems (BTRIS)</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: <br />NIHCCOPC-18004399<br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of software vendors to provide currently functioning software to meet programmatic needs. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can to provide the NIH Clinical Center's Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) with the following DRAFT Scope of Work. The government anticipates the award of a Single software licensing contract with software support for one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods to extend the effective Period of Performance. The award shall not exceed 60 months if all options are exercised.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information. As an organization, the NIH is a unique medical research facility. Management is intentionally decentralized into 24 Institutes and Centers, yet the individual organizations cooperate and collaborate in a useful and necessary partnership. This controlled decentralization is expected to continue as most feel it provides a fertile environment for individual research and supports the incredible scientific diversity represented at NIH.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol. See http://www.nih.gov for additional information on NIH and the various disease-specific institutes that comprise the NIH.</p>
<p>The Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intramural clinical research data repository. BTRIS allows researchers access to data, text and images for over 1800 active clinical research protocols and over 7000 terminated protocols from 1976 to the present. The repository contains over 50 data sources including data from the NIH Clinical Center hospital information systems as well as from institute repositories and clinical trial management systems. Data from contributing systems are received as discrete data values, as well as text and various image document types. Researchers at the NIH use these data, text and images to manage data from active clinical trials, as well as use data in a de-identified format for hypothesis generation and cohort development through the BTRIS user interface.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The BTRIS Program is seeking software solutions to enable the automated removal of personally identifiable information (PII) from electronic health care data in unstructured text format. The program seeks currently functional software applications that can redact all or a specified subset of personal identifiers.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>The NIH BTRIS project seeks text de-identification software for the purpose of removing personally identifiable data from clinical research unstructured text data. Text data are formatted in a variety of formats including RTF, XML, plain text, HTML and PDF, and stored in either databases or as files on BTRIS file server. These files are from the NIH Clinical Center electronic health record (EHR) or from NIH institute research systems. Examples of text files are clinical documentation summaries of care, discharge summaries, consultation reports, adverse event reports, radiology reports, pathology reports, progress notes, surgical summaries and electronic research case report forms. These documents often have different types of PII data embedded in them such as medical record numbers or patient contact information.</p>
<p><br />Ad hoc access to the data is a part of the BTRIS feature set provided to authorized individual users as well as to NIH institutes and centers. Internally developed applications can also be given access to extracted data from BTRIS for use by other repositories.</p>
<p>The BTRIS team envisions using an appropriate extraction methodology for taking original text-based data from the respective repository, transferring it to an application server running the de-identification software, and then loading the redacted records back into a different repository containing only de-identified data. It will be accessible to users wishing to run de-identified queries decreasing the risk of PII exposure compared to on-the-fly redaction routines.</p>
<p>There will be a series of batch transfers and de-identification of data to populate the new data repository, with anticipated ongoing work to de-identify new inbound text documents on a daily basis as well as to add new sources of unstructured or semi-structured information.</p>
<p>The de-identified (redacted) data repository will reside on the same servers as the production storage of identified data.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>Functional Requirements:<br />1. The system shall have the ability to remove the following identifying information from text:<br />1. Names (First, Middle, Last including hyphenated and multi-part last names). Must be able to demonstrate ability to redact names from all ethnicities. <br />2. All geographical subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code, if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.<br />3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older;<br />4. Phone numbers;<br />5. Fax numbers;<br />6. Electronic mail addresses;<br />7. Social Security numbers;<br />8. Medical record numbers;<br />9. Health plan beneficiary numbers;<br />10. Account numbers;<br />11. Certificate/license numbers;<br />12. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;<br />13. Device identifiers and serial numbers;<br />14. Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs);<br />15. Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers;<br />16. Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints;<br />17. Full face photographic images and any comparable images; and<br />18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data)<br />19. Specific identifiers to the NIH environment such as provider names, nursing units, or protocol names that may be deemed to identify a subject (e.g. exemption or compassionate use protocols).</p>
<p>2. Data shall be coded such that the de-identified data can be linked back to the original identified data set - therefore the data in the BTRIS de-identified database shall be considered "coded". The code will not be exposed to the user but shall be used to ensure the correct association and terms of use associated with the original data source. Any code used to replace the identifiers in datasets cannot be derived from any information related to the individual and the master codes. The respondent shall detail how the application would provide a coding system for data elements. <br />3. The system shall have the ability to de-identify data based on RDBMS lists of PII such as patient names, and medical record numbers currently stored in the BTRIS database.<br />4. The system shall preserve medical terms (eponymy) based on UMLS metathesaurus terms and additional medical dictionaries if needed.<br />5. The system shall replace identifiers such that they can be tracked and are consistent within runs. For example, SP20-4567D could be changed to [ID 1] as long as ID 1 always refers to the same identifier within a single run.<br />6. The system shall maintain a history of applied replacements for testing and quality assurance purposes.<br />7. The system shall maintain consistency of subject replacement across queries run in the same batch and/or job. For example, a document batch may consist of 10 various text files. Subject "Robert Smith" shall be assigned a redaction of [SUBJECT 1] and [SUBJECT 1] shall be the same subject across all 10 documents. <br />8. The system shall be able to utilize two different redaction modalities:<br />a. Redaction replacing a subject name such as "Robert Smith" with [SUBJECT 1], an address of "21 Spruce Street" with [STREET ADDRESS] and so on. <br />b. OR -- Redaction replacing a subject name such as "Robert Smith" with [Anthony Jones], an address of "21 Spruce Street" with [10 Cedar Street] and so on. <br />9. The system shall use advanced heuristics, rule sets and lexical and syntactic context to de-identify data.<br />10. Dates shall have the ability to be replaced based on context. <br />a. Some dates will require offsets to maintain narrative integrity. This should be based on a parameter set by BTRIS such as a patient's ID.<br />b. Other dates (such as exam dates) shall have the capability to not be offset to ensure the ability to analyze the temporal nature of events within the scope of limited data sets.<br />c. The ability to control dates as actual or consistently offset shall be determined by the use case.<br />11. The efficacy of system performance shall demonstrate at least 90% recall and 90% precision statistics for de-identification of unstructured text. <br />12. The software shall have the ability to run daily new documents on the file server based on filters defining new data sets.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:<br />1. The software shall have the demonstrated ability to work in the Windows or Linux environments. <br />2. The software should be able to function on physical servers or in the cloud using VM's.<br />3. The system shall have auditing/logging capabilities via a user interface<br />4. BTRIS stores a number of tables of subject names, addresses, medical record numbers and other forms of PII. The software proposed shall be able to access and utilize these lists in an automated fashion. These lists may be stored in a relational database (e.g. RDBMS tables) or in a non-relational database such as MongoDB.<br />5. The software should have the demonstrated capability of using API calls to or from other application platforms such as Elasticsearch, Apelon DTS terminology system or a FHIR terminology server.<br />6. Software bug fixes shall be made available on a routine basis.<br />7. Software enhancements shall be provided as a part of the maintenance agreement.<br />8. System documentation shall be made available in electronic format.<br />9. The software shall have the ability to process data provided through an encrypted pipeline.<br />10. If data are stored on the application server, the software application shall be able to process data that are encrypted at rest.</p>
<p>User Support Requirements:<br />1. The user support help desk shall be available during normal business hours (8-5 ET) Monday through Friday via toll-free number or e-mail. <br />2. A tiered-response system shall be used to address issues. When the software is not functional a response and plan for remediation shall be available within four hours.<br />3. User support shall commence upon delivery of the software product.</p>
<p>Software Use:<br />The software may be used by any subdivision of the licensing agency (service, bureau, division, command, etc.) that has access to the site the software is placed at, even if the subdivision did not participate in the acquisition of the software, so long as the number of licensed users are appropriately accounted for in the license (as applicable). The Government shall have the right to use the computer software and documentation with the computer for which it is acquired at any facility to which that computer may be transferred.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing the following:
<p>A Contractor to (1) provide local fishing vessels and personnel able to conduct required activities as part of the fishery-independent survey for bottomfish in waters around the Main Hawaiian Islands. The fishery-independent survey builds upon previous preliminary and operational research. Research on these activities was initiated in 2009/2010, and has continued, informing much of the methodology for development of the current survey. Data from the survey will be used to help determine abundance estimates for use in the bottomfish stock assessment in the Main Hawaiian Islands. These data will also be used to refine optimal gear(s), sample sizes, and bottomfish habitat definitions needed to continue to implement fishery-independent surveys in the PIR.</p>
<p>The fishing vessels doing the work shall have, in proper working order, all required USCG approved safety, navigation and communication devices. Captains of contracted vessels must have sufficient experience with bottomfish fishing in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Scientific observers must be familiar with scientific field sampling and measurement methods for fish, associated field sampling and data recording equipment, and must be able to visually identify to species of commonly caught fishes by Hawaiian bottomfish fishing gear using proper taxonomic nomenclature.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the necessary vessels, personnel, equipment, and services (including all bottomfish fishing gear, bait, safety equipment, and insurance for the vessel and the ship's personnel) <br />sufficient to conduct fishing operations within a 2 month designated time window (as designated in Activities 1 - 8 below) in up to 250 pre-selected grids in waters around the Main Hawaiian Islands as part of the PIFSC fishery independent bottomfish survey.  In addition, provide Scientific Observers to collect scientific data while at sea. Vessels must be capable of housing a minimum of 3 personnel: 1-2 Scientific Observers in addition to the Captain and Crew, for the duration of each fishing trip.</p>
<p>Activity 1:	Fishery-Independent Survey - Following established protocols (survey design and data collection from previous gear comparison and pilot fishery independent research), conduct hook-and-line research-fishing for the fishery-independent survey for bottomfish in waters around the Main Hawaiian Islands in either the winter/spring of 2019 or the summer/fall of 2019. Specific tasks include:</p>
<p>&#9679;	With assistance from PIFSC, identify contractor-provided  fishing vessels (including Captain and Crew) to conduct sampling using standardized bottomfish fishing gear at up to 250 pre-selected grids (defined as 500 meter by 500 meter units) within a designated 2 month time window. Sites will be proportionate to the bottomfish habitat across islands. Exact numbers will vary, but the approximate distribution is: 25% for the Big Island, 5% for Kauai, 55% for Maui Nui, 5% for Niihau and 10% for Oahu. <br />&#9679;	Provide Scientific Observers to record fishing operation and biological data on each fishing vessel.<br />&#9679;	Coordinate with and provide logistical support to Vessel Captains and Scientific Observers (with crew optional) to attend a PIFSC-led training session prior to and debriefing session after each survey to discuss program goals and objectives, scientific protocols, and responsibilities. <br />&#9679;	Procure all necessary gear, equipment, and supplies for contracted vessels to carry out the requirements contained herein.<br />&#9679;	Maintain communication with contracted vessels to provide support as needed throughout the project, and to provide status updates to PIFSC.<br />&#9679;	Provide necessary data forms and equipment, including electronic devices equipped with a data entry application developed by PIFSC, to Scientific Observers as required. <br />&#9679;	PIFSC will provide initial training on the use of electronic devices to observers on fishing vessels; however, the contractor shall assist with setting up the devices and provide assistance with troubleshooting questions and issues that may arise. <br />&#9679;	Inspect collected data to ensure accurate completion and legibility during the survey and submit all data in the form it was collected to PIFSC for analysis within two weeks of survey completion.<br />&#9679;	As cellular/internet coverage allows, transmit data via the electronic application or images or scans of paper data sheets during the survey period to PIFSC to ensure data are being filled-in according to procedures. <br />&#9679;	Provide biosamples of fish caught during operations that meet PIFSC-specified criteria, retain, affix ID tag, store, and send whole fishes to PIFSC, as logistics permit and according to storage and transport requirements.</p>
<p>Option Activity 2:	Constituent Meetings - Assist with logistics to convene at least two constituent meetings (including fishers and scientists) throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands to discuss progress of activities as well as pertinent research on bottomfish in the Pacific Islands Region. Specific tasks include:<br /> <br />&#9679;	Provide logistical support and convene meetings with PIFSC stakeholders. Work with PIFSC staff to inform stakeholders, such as fishers, fishing clubs, and fishing organizations to inform their members, and other industry participants about ongoing bottomfish related PIFSC projects that benefit from fisher engagement such as data workshops, listening sessions, the fisheries independent survey effort, and other outreach efforts that support PIFSC goals relative to cooperative research activities. <br />&#9679;	Provide all meeting materials (e.g., brochures), equipment (e.g., PA system, facility rental costs) to conduct the meeting.</p>
<p>Option Activity 3:	An additional fishery-independent survey using contractor-provided vessels sampling in up to 250 pre-selected grids over a designated 2 month time window (as described above in Activity 1) shall be conducted around the Main Hawaiian Islands. This additional survey in each contract period will provide requisite data to assess seasonal variability in bottomfish abundance estimates.</p>
<p>Option Activity 4:	Provide contractor-provided vessels which shall sample up to an additional 75 pre-selected grids around the Main Hawaiian Islands as part of activities specified in Activity 1 above. These additional grids will be within the same spatial scope and time window as grids for Activity 1 and are intended to provide adaptability in the survey design to address fluctuating strata-specific variability in catches. Sampling protocols for these grids will be the same as grids for Activity 1.</p>
<p>Option Activity 5:	Provide contractor-provided  vessels which shall sample up to an additional 75 pre-selected grids around the Main Hawaiian Islands as part of activities specified in Activity 3 above. These additional grids will be within the same spatial scope and time window as grids for Activity 3 and are intended to provide adaptability in the survey design to address fluctuating strata-specific variability in catches. Sampling protocols for these grids will be the same as grids for Activity 3.    <br /> <br />Option Activity 6:	Provide up to two contractor-provided vessels to deploy and recover the PIFSC Modular Optical Underwater Survey System (MOUSS) in up to a total of 50 pre-selected grids within the existing operational area for Activity 1 to include:</p>
<p>&#9679;	Contractor to provide vessels for this activity must be capable of safely launching and recovering the MOUSS, which is launched and recovered in a manner similar to that used for a single lobster, crab, or fish trap. The MOUSS measures 40 inches in width by 19 inches in depth by 9.5 inches in height and weighs approximately 60 lbs. Additional MOUSS components include a 75 lb. anchor, up to 1600 ft. of &#8540; inch line stored in one to two 55 gallon trash cans, two surface and one subsurface floats (each approximately 1.5 ft. in diameter).  The configuration of MOUSS from the seafloor to the surface is as follows: lead anchor, ~15 feet of &#8540; anchor line, MOUSS, 400 - 1600 feet of &#8540; subsurface line, subsurface float, additional 10-15 feet of &#8540; subsurface line, two surface floats. The MOUSS also utilizes 0.5kg of chum, which must be provided by the contractor, and is the same as the bait used for Activity 1. The vessel is required to carry one to two MOUSS units. Transportation of the MOUSS system and supplies to vessels on neighboring islands in the responsibility of the Government.   <br />&#9679;	Sampling protocols for these grids include two drops per grid with a 15 minute soak time per drop. Grid depth shall be between 75 and 250 meters. <br />&#9679;	In addition to existing vessel requirements, contractor-provided vessels for this activity must have:<br />&#9675;	A hydraulic or electric pinch puller or similar capable of lifting 500 lbs.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unique Requirements: The building associated with this offer must be served by a full load generator and water tank/Cistern to ensure uninterrupted electric and water service during short term and long term power outages and emergency situations at no additional cost to the Government. The occupying agency must be able to fully perform their core mission during any power outage. In addition, offered space shall be distributed in contiguous space on each floor.</p>
<p>Agency Tenant Improvement Allowance:		Existing leased Space:            	     $55.62 per ABOA SF <br />Other locations offered:            	$55.62 per ABOA SF</p>
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG02.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 18-REG02 by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.

The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT, GENERATOR REPLACEMENT<br /> <br />The U.S General Services Administration, Great Lakes Region, is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for a project that will provide a new natural&#8208;gas fired electrical generator for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) critical systems located in the P.V. McNamara (PVM) Federal Building in Detroit, Michigan. This Sources Sought announcement is being issued to determine the interest, availability, and capability of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Business concerns as described below. The NAICS codes being considered for this procurement are 236220 and/or 238210.
<p><br />The new generator will be sized 34kW, will be located inside the existing penthouse generator room on the roof of the PVM building, and will be connected to existing natural gas piping and surge tank. The new generator will connect to a new automatic transfer switch and DHS critical systems located on the 3rd floor of the PVM building, as detailed in the project drawings. The existing Waukesha generator in the generator room is abandoned and will be removed as part of this project. Removal will be through an access hatch from the roof into the 27th floor mechanical room - this will require removal and then reinstallation of some ductwork in the space. Other potential methods of removal include crane lift or helicopter lift from the roof. Contractors are to specify if they have had experience with either type of lift in their response to this notice. Demolition work shall comply with GSA Construction Waste Management Requirements. Fire sprinkler piping in the generator room will be replaced with a new stand&#8208;alone dry&#8208;pipe system. New connections to existing Fire Alarm system in the building will thus be required as well. The estimated construction cost is between $250,000 and $500,000.  Construction is currently estimated to take 120 days.</p>
<p>The contractor is to provide all the management, supervision, manpower, equipment and supplies necessary for this project.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no anticipated date that the Request for Proposal will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov). The awardee will be required to complete the security clearance process. The full extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted. No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT for planning purposes only. Market research is being conducted to determine if there are Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Women Owned Small Business, 8(a), or Small Businesses with the capabilities to perform the required work.<br /><br />All interested parties should submit a capabilities package to include: 1. Business classification (i.e., SDVOSB, HUBZone, etc.) 2. Examples of three projects: (i) completed within the last five years; (ii) that included the work specified above that will be required under this project; (iii) that the offeror performed at least 20% of the work with its own organization under the contract; and (iv) that had a total project cost in the same range estimated for this project. Please provide a customer point of contact for each project listed; 3. Contractor experience using helicopter or crane lifts in high rise commercial or government office buildings.<br /> <br />Electronic versions of your capabilities statement shall be submitted VIA EMAIL ONLY to Kendrall.Masten@gsa.gov. Responses are due by Tuesday, February 20, 2018 at 12:00 PM (CST). NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey or return the data provided. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list, nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Regional Health Contracting Office - Atlantic (RHCO-A), Womack Army Medical Center, Ft Bragg, North Carolina intents to Sole Source the below products as they are the only manufacturer that makes these products.<br />ALERE 30 S Keller Road Suite 100<br />Orlando, FL 32810-6927
<p>Products:</p>
<p>23 046 617 Alere I Instrument (with Scanner and Printer) 25 ea</p>
<p><br /><br />Womack Army Medical Center has a requirement for the procurement of the Alere<sup>TM</sup> i Molecular Instrument to conduct CLIA waived rapid molecular, isothermal nucleic acid amplification for influenza, RSV, and group A Streptococcus testing. This method includes direct specimen sample and results within 15 minutes. This platform is projected to expand to perform CLIA waived molecular Clostridium difficile. Our current method for influenza testing is to perform an invasive nasal wash, which is harsh for the pediatric and elderly patients. All Alere<sup>TM</sup> tests are performed by swabs which will alleviate the invasive and stressful procedure.</p>
<p>The Alere<sup>TM</sup> i Strep A and Influenza kits will be procured through the Defense Medical Logistics Supply System, which is the preferred source for medical supply ordering for Womack Army Medical Center. Future kits will also be available in the system to order. The swabs provided with these kits are not kit specific; therefore any swab can be used as long as it is not calcium alginate. Our current, Strep kit is swab specific and there was an issue of running out of swabs in the ED last winter.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes; however, if your company has information or products for future surgeries, please send your capabilities statement for review. All responses will be received no later than 19 February 2018 at 11:00 AM EST. For more information please contact Ms. Cynthia A. Richardson at Cynthia.a.richardson.civ@mail.mil</p>

12. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES:
A. Contractor shall be liable to the Government for losses of production due to significant equipment downtime.  Significant equipment downtime is that which exceeds ten (10) hours/month.  Records regarding downtime will be kept by the COR and the maintenance contractor.
B. Equipment downtime is calculated only from those normal hours of coverage (see Hours of Coverage Section) that the scheduled equipment is not fully operational.  Downtime will begin when the Contractor is required to be on site (see Unscheduled Maintenance Section response time definition) after notification by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  Downtime will accumulate until the scheduled equipment is returned to full and usual operation and accepted as such by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  This does not include scheduled maintenance for PM purposes or when waiting for VA furnished tubes.  Refusal of access to the equipment indicates that the unit is up and running and this time will not be considered when determining downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment voids the service call.
C. If downtime exceeds sixteen (16) consecutive hours, the CO may exercise the option to hire an alternate source to resolve the problem.  The decision to exercise this alternative will reside exclusively with the CO.  All fees generated by the alternate Contractor(s) will be handled in accordance with Default clause.
D. Monies will be subtracted from the contract if the Contractor fails to meet the up-time requirements using the following formula:
MONTHLY        MONTHS
DOWNTIME

10 - 11 hours/month   0%

12 - 13 hours/month   20%

14 - 15 hours/month   40%

16 - 17 hours/month   60%

18 - 19 hours/month   80%

20 or more hours/month  100%

These will be computed for the monthly dollar totals.

PAYMENT: Invoices will be paid in arrears on a quarterly basis. Invoices, MUST INCLUDE, at a minimum, the following information: Contract No., Purchase Order No., Item(s) covered (to include serial #'s) by the PMI and covered period of service.  Each invoice must be provided in triplicate.

14. ADDITIONAL CHARGES: There will be no additional charge for time spent at the site (during, or after the normal hours of coverage) awaiting the arrival of additional FSE and/or delivery of parts.
REPORTING REQUIRED SERVICES BEYOND THE CONTRACT SCOPE:
The Contractor shall immediately, but no later than 24 (twenty-four) consecutive hours after discovery, notify the CO and COR (in writing) of the existence or the development of any defects in, or repairs required, to the scheduled equipment which the Contractor considers he/she is not responsible for under the terms of the contract.  The Contractor shall furnish the CO and COR with a written estimate of the cost to make necessary repairs.
16. CONDITION OF EQUIPMENT: The Contractor accepts responsibility for the equipment in "as is" condition.  Failure to inspect the equipment prior to contract award will not relieve the Contractor from performance of the requirements of this contract.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - Annual Preventative Maintenance for Amsco Lab 250 Small Laboratory Steam Sterilizer <br />Solicitation Number: AG-64PP-S-18-0003<br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The intent of this special notice is for informational purposes only. The USDA, ARS, Columbia, MO intends to award a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), "Soliciting from a single source" based upon only one responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement. The USDA intends to award a sole source procurement to Steris Corporation, 5960 Heisley Road, Mentor, OH., 44060. The award will be for an annual preventative maintenance agreement for an Amsco Lab 250 Small Laboratory Steam Sterilizer. Due to the proprietary properties of the sterilizer, the only company that would be able to supply replacement parts and/or maintenance for the sterilizer is the company that actually built it. That company is STERIS Corporation. To the best of our knowledge, due to the proprietary properties of the equipment, STERIS Corporation is the only company that is able to offer maintenance services for the sterilizer. The government intends to award a firm, fixed price Purchase Order for these maintenance services using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br />This Notice of Intent is not considered a Request for Quote (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP).

<p>&bull; Service agreement for RapidHIT 2000 and ID Instruments <br />o Coverage to include all parts and labor<br />o 1 Preventative Maintenance service visit per year</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that IntegenX, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the RapidHIT 2000 and ID instruments; therefore, they are the only company capable of providing the necessary service and support for this instrument.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13) with OI Analytical/CMS Field Products, as the only responsible source capable of providing CHROM-LINK Air Monitoring Data Acquisition and Control System to the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Anniston, AL. Specifically, the contractor shall provide eleven (11) CHROM-LINK Air Monitoring systems (P/N CHL-100) to CDP.<br />&nbsp;
<p>OI Analytical/CMS Field Products is the sole U.S. distributor of the proprietary equipment and software comprising the subject requirement. An introduction of competing manufacturers' products is impractical and fiscally imprudent because of the Government's existing air monitoring configuration, protocols and standard operating procedures, all of which have been developed and implemented to support the Series 4000 MINICAMS within the CDP's COBRA Training Facility. The introduction of competing manufacturers' products would substantially increase the cost of this procurement and create an unacceptable risk to the Government and its toxic agent training program. The use of any other product would result in the substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures (IAW FAR 13). There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 1000 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to James Suerdieck at <a href="mailto:james.suerdieck@fema.dhs.gov">james.suerdieck@fema.dhs.gov</a>. Statements are due by 4:00 PM Eastern, 02 MAR 2018. No phone calls accepted.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source for Thermo Electron
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Thermo Electron for an annual maintenance agreement, with three option years, for total of four years.  The Thermo-Electron System 7 (NS7) microanalysis units/systems and Ultrdary detector requires preventative maintenance and immediate access to trained personnel for repair of instrumentation and computer components in the event of a malfunction. Due to the proprietary nature of the sensitive, and highly complex system, maintenance and repairs can only be performed by instruments manufacturer and this supports researchers. 

The period of performance for this effort will be a 12-month base period with three (3) 12-month option periods.  The optional periods are for additional annual subscriptions.  The total estimated value is less than $40,000.00. 

This is considered a sole source to Thermo Electron because, to the best of the NETLs knowledge, based on market research conducted, Thermo Electron is the only known source that can provide this type of service.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 5:30 PM ET on March 2, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to shannon.lynch@netl.doe.gov  no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This special notice is being issued in order to provide all interested parties with information on the planned acquisition strategy as determined through market research. 
 
This procurement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis.  A sources sought notice was posted to NECO/FedBizOps 25 June 2017 (N62470-17-R-4014) to determine availability and capability of qualified firms to perform the requirement.

 NAVFAC Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with the determination to solicit as an unrestricted procurement.
  
The solicitation will include NAVFACs standard small business evaluation factor which will require all entities to provide historical achievements in utilizing small business concerns as subcontractors and demonstrate their proposed small business participation and commitment strategies. In addition, large business entities will be required to provide a small business subcontracting plan which will include NAVFACs standard subcontracting targets.

All responsible firms may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  All prospective contractors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

No additional information is currently available.

Subsequently, the vendor will propose (map, document, process flow, etc.) contract administration close-out procedures designed for partial or fill automation. To include conducting a technology assessment to select the most suitable RPA vendor based on unique requirements of the OIG environment and process requirements. Once the technology is selected, the vendor will design, configure, and test a proof of concept automation deployment for a procedure outlined in the overall proposed close-out process. A high-level deployment roadmap for additional automation activities will also be provided to the HHS OIG. The outcome is to test the feasibility of reducing burden on OIG by decreasing the number of individuals and the total number of days required to close contracts.&nbsp;In addition, the vendor will assess other benefits such as error reduction, increased throughput, and 24/7 operations.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Amy A. Kelm, Phone 2062176767, Email amy.a.kelm@uscg.mil
<DESC><br />The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to solicit, on a sole source basis, to OmniThruster Inc., 2201 Pinnacle Parkway, Twinsburg, OH 44087, USA, for modification kits to the USCGC HEALY's bow thruster system under FAR 6.302-1, " Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". These kits consist of the following: vanes, shafts, bearings, seals, actuators, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) hardware &amp; software, and materials/equipment lists.
<p><br />OmniThruster Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and is the only known source to have access to the propriety data needed to complete the manufacture of the modification kits for the bow thruster system. The USCG does not possess the data rights to the bow thruster system; therefore, only OmniThruster Inc. has the proprietary knowledge, design data and drawings needed to manufacture the kits. In addition, OmniThruster Inc. was recently awarded a sole-source engineering contract (HSCG85-17-P-P45487) for the design of the modification kits.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. All written responses shall include a written narrative of capability, including technical information demonstrating the contractor's ability to meet the above requirements. The responses need to be sufficient so that the Government can establish that the Contractor possesses a bona-fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a non-competitive (i.e., sole source) procurement with OmniThruster Inc.. A determination by the Government to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses are to be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis. All information in response to this notification shall be submitted via email to Contract Specialist/Officer Amy Kelm at Amy.A.Kelm@uscg.mil . Please title your email as follows, "Response to Sole Source Intent Notice 70Z08518IBowKits".</p>

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  

(b)	 Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Under Cast Padding. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) ME-1706-35_Under_Cast_Padding are eligible for participation. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Under Cast Padding products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL ME-1706-35_Under_Cast_Padding. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 03 Apr 18. Among vendors who are on QSL ME-1706-35_Under_Cast_Padding, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Under Cast Padding.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /><br /></span>A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Under Cast Padding. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $244,993 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL ME-1706-35_Under_Cast_Padding who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Europe via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. The best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></span>The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. An IA will only be issued once the Vendor has established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line. Failure to establish approved DAPA base uncommitted prices will preclude a vendor from establishing an IA with the government. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /><br /></strong>1.	Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Required Products /	Annual Usage in Units /</span>

Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs, and factor PV costs into their offered IA tier pricing.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs)</span>:<br /><br />MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, Mr. Rob Halliday, 319-590-4090 (DSN), robert.b.halliday2.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO Europe Team Leader, Mr. Thomas Winkel, DSN: 314-590-4089, thomas.p.winkel.ctr@mail.mil.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />10.
