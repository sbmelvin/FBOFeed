Subject: 	Pre-solicitation Notice #623-KE-08-003, entitled "Draft Requirement of the Pharma Project in Kenya"

Dear Interested parties,
This is to inform you that USAID has released the draft statement of work for the "USAID Pharma Project" for your close review and considered comment. Comment must be provided no later than Tuesday, October 23, 2007, 4:30 pm, (Kenya time) via email to codonnell@usaid.gov, pmuthee@usaid.gov and cafrica@usaid.gov.

The draft statement of work may be found at http://www.usaid/gov/ke/ under "Business and Procurement" sublink or sent via email by the above named individuals upon request. In summary the purpose of the pending requirement is to establish and operate a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable supply-chain management system to forecast, procure, store, and distribute the drugs, supplies, and equipment needed to provide care and treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS in Kenya. At the moment, USAID foresees that the contract requirement will not entail actually procuring laboratory materials and equipment such as rapid test kits, reagents or machines. 

A lesser but equally important component of the Pharma Project will be to build the capacity of Kenyan institutions and personnel in supply chain management in order to ensure the effectiveness, quality and sustainability of HIV/AIDS interventions.

The anticipated ceiling price is over $500,000,000.00 over a maximum 5 year period of performance.

USAID plans to hold a Pre-solicitation Conference in Nairobi, Kenya on or about November 6, 2007. Details of the conference and the registration process will be communicated through an Amendment to this Pre-solicitation Notice. The complete RFP in draft form should be released no later than October 31, 2007, prior to the planned pre-solicitation conference. 

Sincerely,
Christopher D. O?Donnell

<DESC>Through this solicitation, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking to establish and support several multi-disciplinary teams of biochemists and immunologists focused on the discovery of novel allergens and/or T cell epitopes that are recognized by different T cell subsets.  This solicitation will support two distinct areas of research. 

a)	Research Area 1:  Identification Validation, and Characterization of Novel Allergens  research projects to use established or innovative isolation and purification techniques to identify novel allergens from various sources.
b)	Research Area 2:  Identification and Validation of Allergen-Specific T Cell Epitopes  research projects to identify and characterize peptides containing T cell epitopes that activate allergen-specific effector T cells, and/or activate allergen-specific regulatory T cells. 

This resource reagent development initiative is an important component of the mission of the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), which is to promote the study of allergic diseases, define the mechanisms that underlie these diseases, and ultimately develop therapies for the treatment of these diseases.

<CONTACT>Douglas Kirkpatrick, Program Manager, STO, Phone 703-696-4762, Fax 703-516-8788, Email Douglas.Kirkpatrick@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of high resolution affordable emissive micro-displays.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  The High Resolution Affordable Emissive Micro-Displays (EMD) program will develop a new generation of emissive micro-displays with high brightness, long lifetime, good electrical efficiency, and low cost. The principal application target for this new capability is the emergent arena of dynamic holography. Current micro-displays are expensive, optically inefficient, unsuitable for tiling into large area displays, or incapable of achieving long lifetimes at the necessary level of brightness and spatial resolution.

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 08-02, entitled High Resolution Affordable Emissive Micro-Displays (EMD), is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; the submission process; abstract and proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.     The BAA may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or by electronic mail request to the email address given below.

Administrative, technical, or contractual questions should be sent via e-mail to BAA08-02@darpa.mil. All requests must include the name, address, and phone number of a point of contact.

Within acquisition programs, warfare analysis is used to ensure engineering level performance and design are in fact meeting campaign, mission, and engagement level warfighting capability requirements.  The multi-faceted scope of support services to be obtained through this acquisition includes warfare analysis, M&S, software development, and analytic program support.  MS&A support will be performed at the campaign, mission and/or engagement level to identify warfighting gaps, determine the effectiveness of various alternatives in meeting those gaps, and ensure engineering level performance and designs meet warfighting capabilities requirements ? all of which will provide the analytic underpinning for capability based acquisition decisions.  Conceptual, developmental, and existing subsystems, systems, SoS, and Family-of-Systems (FoS), with associated Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and tactics, will be assessed within operational and tactical situations to derive optimal Naval warfighting capability requirements.  The applicable SIC code for this requirement is 8711.  The appropriate NAICS code is 541330, with a small business standard of $23.0 million.

The United States Postal Service's (USPS) final rule issued on November 27, 1992 called for all federal agencies, including SSA, to establish a system of direct accountability (DA) of the Agency's actual postage expenditures. SSA's primary method of DA has been the metering of all outgoing mail at all Agency mail sites nationwide. SSA intends to negotiate and award a contract for the agency's ongoing DA services and equipment with PITNEY BOWES CORPORATION, 7630 Little River Turnpike, 8th Floor; Annandale, VA 22003-2610 This will be a follow-on contract to contract 600-03-60046 awarded to Pitney Bowes January 30, 2003.

EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS: All purchased equipment will be new, include effective interfacing, delivery, installation, training, maintenance and rate change coverage and start-up supplies. TECHNOLOGY SUBSTITUTION: The Government may require the contractor to substitute equipment (new technology) provided that the item(s) are fully compatible with existing equipment, be field proven and off the shelf configurations, and the price of the items(s) including maintenance shall be equal to or lower than that originally proposed .

e.	Provides facility, site, city, region, world situational awareness via a intuitive 2D and 3D user interface and displays the current status of Intrusion Detection Systems and site status - critical
f.	Displays access control badge information (real time card swipe with user picture information and search functions) - critical
g.	Provides automated event triggered response (e.g. cues cameras, retrieves playback video, displays information and SOPs) - critical
h.	Ability to display site information and SOPs in HTML (MHT) format and able to assign specific SOPs to different events 
i.	Displays and controls security systems and facilities through an interactive high resolution photo realistic 3D facility models, showing both external and internal views and sensor locations and overlayed on satellite or aerial imagery.  Models must be in OSGA, OSG, 3DS or FLT format - critical
j.	Allows integration of 2D satellite and aerial imagery and other GIS data - critical
k.	Provides zoomable views from global, regional, citywide and facility perspectives - critical

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The scope of the action provides for operational support, maintenance and training for fielded Geosynchronous Earth Orbit Local User Terminal (GEOLUT) and Lo w Earth Orbit Local User Terminal (LEOLUT) Search and Rescue (SAR) systems within Iraq.    It is anticipated that this action will be a time and materials Contract that will support both Firm Fixed price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M) delivery orders.  EMS Technologies is uniquely qualified for this effort, because it is the sole contractor capable of meeting the performance and schedule requirements for emergency location equipment and support services for this requirement.  EMS Technologies proprietar y software, Search and Rescue Master (SARMaster), is the system installed into the current US DoD ground infrastructure for search and rescue.  This contract award enables the continuation of that effort.   No other contractor could meet the Governments r equirement, without excessive expenditures and an unacceptable delay before the necessary support would be online and operational.  Offerors who can demonstrate they can meet the Governments requirement shall submit a white paper of no more than 15 pages by 26 October 2007. Offerors that submit a white paper that demonstrate an ability to meet this requirement will be considered for a ward.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, Maryland and the Office of Intramural Research (OIR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with HWS Enterprises to develop and run a management skills course specifically oriented to scientists.  The objectives of the course will be to provide: assessments of management styles, through the use of those standard tests useful for scientific leadership (360 skill scope, Myers Briggs Type Inventory and Thomas ? Killman Conflict Inventory), assessment of leadership skills and self knowledge, training in the time management, training in conflict resolution, training in getting the best from teams, training in decision making, training in motivating others and identification and development of a plan for goal setting.  The contractor shall be knowledgeable of the theory and practice of education in management skills, demonstrated experience in development of a specific program appropriate for scientists, demonstrated expertise in facilitation of the program with scientists and extensive and demonstrated expertise in program evaluation and follow-up design. The course must be developed and presented by individuals experienced with the issues that scientists have and whom scientist will find credible.  NIH /OIR will be responsible for all costs associated with the logistics of the meeting, including but not limited to meeting room, audio visual, food, and local transportation, facilitating pre-session logistics with the participants, including ensuring their completion of the testing material.  The Contractor should deliver 30 copies of testing materials one month prior to the training.  Once the training has been completed, the Contractor should deliver five hard copies, along with a copy on a PC- compatible disk (in WordPerfect or  MS Word), of the final program evaluation and follow-up design.   NIH believes that the above reference firm is the only source that can provide this requirement. HWS is an expert in the development of management skills courses which are needed to continue the ongoing training needed to manage the increased complexities of modern biomedical research and the only firm to specifically design such a course for scientists.  HWS has designed courses for the PEW Scholars and is currently preparing a series for faculty at UCSF Medical School.  HWS has experience and knowledge related to the area of management skills.  NIH tenured and tenure-tract investigators to manage their laboratories, personnel and resources enable the tenure-track investigators to achieve success in becoming tenured.  HWS has successfully handled numerous courses over the past years, and have received excellent ratings from all the PIs who have taken the courses. However, if any other interested party believes that they can meet the requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of evaluation results.  The closing date will be 10 calendar days after publication.  All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor?s Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date.  If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non responsive.

<DESC>Title: National Agriculture Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reporting of Soil Organic Carbon and Soil Nitrous Oxide Emissions Posting Date: October 11, 2007 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Administrative Contract Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460 Response Date: November 12, 2007 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT A RFQ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division (CCD), Program Integration Branch intends to award a sole source fixed-price contract under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303-1 (a)(2), to Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins, CO.  The staff at CSU, are uniquely qualified to complete this work for EPA.  The CSU team has developed extensive expertise in utilizing the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change methodology for estimating soil carbon stocks in the US and remains the only group of scientists who have successfully applied the IPCC methodology to the existing US activity data for generation of national soil carbon estimates.   EPA has utilized the soil carbon estimates generated by the CSU team over the last eight years in the annual publication of the US Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.  The Century/Daycent models, which will be used for the foreseeable future to estimate soil carbon and nitrous oxide flux from soils, were developed by a team at CSU.  Members of the CSU team have recently run these models for the US, and the soil carbon and soil nitrous oxide estimates generated from the models were utilized in 1900-2005 US Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.    Members of the team have been working for over seven years to develop the methodology and associated documentation for the soil carbon estimates and for two years on the soil nitrous oxide estimates used in the US Greenhouse Gas Inventory.  The team contains the Lead Author on the soil carbon chapter of the recently completed 2006 IPCC Guidelines, amongst many other IPCC publications, which are used as the methodological basis for developing the greenhouse gas estimates in national inventories including the United States?.  For these reasons, the proposed team is exceptionally and uniquely qualified to undertake these tasks and present the best value to the US Government. The purpose of this acquisition is to support the national agriculture greenhouse gas inventory reporting of soil organic carbon and soil nitrous oxide emissions.  The contractor will provide the inventory estimates and the required documentation for soil organic Carbon stock changes in croplands and grasslands, and soil Nitrous Oxide emissions from all managed lands disaggregated to the state level.  The contractor will provide the Agency with text, tables and summary spreadsheets documenting the data, methods and results from the soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide analyses; agricultural soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide methodology annexes for inclusion in the US GHG Inventory; maps and appendices depicting variation in state-level carbon stock changes and Nitrous Oxide emissions; data inputs for the Common Reporting Format Tables; a Quality Control/Assurance Report for each inventory assessment; and responses to reviewer comments from the expert and public review comment periods. This is not a request for quotation.  No contract will awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.  Response to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  Consideration of responses is solely within the discretion of the Government, generally for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please include your number, point of contact, address, and telephone number.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract to develop and implement a training program in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) research methodologies that will emphasize hands-on experience, at a site to be designated as a NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury.?  

BACKGROUND

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the lead NIH Institute for funding of SCI research, and the major supporter of basic science to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.  In the United States, the incidence of SCI is approximately 11,000 per year.  Over the past three decades, academic researchers have developed and increasingly utilized standardized techniques designed to model human SCI in the rodent.  These include contusion, compression and partial or complete transection, and most have targeted thoracic spinal segments.  Several new models have been developed in recent years including mouse SCI and cervical injuries in both rat and mouse.  It is a great challenge for researchers new to the field to learn these procedures based solely on the literature.  It is difficult to learn to use these standard animal models of SCI with precision and to develop the expertise and facilities to adequately maintain and assess the animals after surgery.

SCI at different levels of the spinal cord result in a range of functional deficits in motor, sensory and autonomic functions.  A crucial element in conducting SCI research is to have the ability to evaluate the return of behavior and function in a careful and meaningful manner.  Behavioral measures of motor and sensory function have been developed, including the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor score, and more recently, the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS).  These metrics were developed to be sensitive to a range of injury severities, and are now used widely to assess novel therapeutic strategies, in conjunction with anatomical and physiological assessments.  New investigators require instruction and practice in the performance and use of these procedures in order to interpret their results accurately and reproducibly.  In addition, a number of other functional measures of forelimb and autonomic and sexual functions have been introduced recently, as well as training modalities and robotic devices designed to model rehabilitative therapies and monitor recovery.  Several of these measures were developed in previously awarded Facilities of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury (FORE-SCI) facilities and, as yet, have not been used extensively by other laboratories. 

A significant number of potential therapeutic approaches to protect and repair the injured spinal cord have been identified, but few of these have reached the stage of clinical trials and none have been successfully translated into clinical practice.  Among several key factors limiting successful translation, the quality and reproducibility of the reported results is one that can be directly addressed by training opportunities for investigators and trainees in laboratories undertaking SCI research.  Based on a series of workshops, NINDS identified several unmet needs in the field of SCI and issued a Broad Agency Announcement in 2002 to develop contracts for FORE-SCI for training in SCI research methods, replication studies, and development of improved outcome assessments.  To date, the FORE-SCI hands-on course has been run at a single site, for three continuous weeks annually, accommodating 16 students per year.  A report published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine emphasized the need for continuing instructional and collaborative opportunities in SCI research, specifically citing the training supported by the NINDS contract.  The NINDS now seeks to re-compete this effort by soliciting proposals for a program to teach standard SCI research techniques and to provide opportunities for hands-on experience with these techniques.  

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTRACT

This solicitation is for development and implementation of a training program in SCI research methodologies that will emphasize hands-on experience, at a site to be designated as a NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury.?  Its purpose is to provide short-term intensive training for researchers new to SCI research on the best practices in the field, including the standards of current research methodology, analytical procedures and functional outcome evaluations.  The FORE-SCI Contractor shall provide resources, capabilities and expertise in SCI research and the ability to work with multiple standard rodent models of injury.  The Contractor shall provide facilities and personnel for expert handling, care and medical management of animals with SCI, and FORE-SCI participants will become expert the ethical conduct of experiments in SCI and associated animal care.  The site will provide dedicated facilities and expertise for conducting surgery, including microsurgery such as transplants and grafts, and for cellular analyses ranging from neuroanatomy and histology to electrophysiology and other cutting-edge technologies.  This FORE-SCI program will provide training for participants, from graduate student to faculty level, to promote consistency of procedures and practices across laboratories.  

It is anticipated that this annual training program will yield a well-trained cadre of researchers dedicated to advancing research to relieve the burden of SCI.  A successful program will prepare FORE-SCI participants to return to their organizations/institutions with the ability to perform rigorous experimental programs of the highest quality, and to disseminate the techniques they have learned to others in their laboratories.  

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOALS OF THIS CONTRACT ARE: 

a.  To develop the scientific content, curriculum and format of a comprehensive, hands-on training program in SCI research to investigators interested in SCI research, utilizing standard models of SCI in rodents.  The training program must:
1.  Cover topics including, but not limited to, surgical techniques, functional/behavioral outcomes, preparation of samples and analysis of histological endpoints, and physiological measures.  
2.  Afford students sufficient hands-on experience to become proficient in these techniques and expert in methods for proper daily handling and medical maintenance of animals incapacitated by SCI.  
3.  Provide students with a basic understanding of the nature of human spinal cord injury, and the perspective and needs of individuals that have sustained such injuries.

b.  To organize and conduct the training program, including provision of facilities, recruitment and selection of faculty and participants. 

c.  To conduct formal evaluation of the course on a yearly basis and, where relevant, incorporate results into subsequent course offerings.  

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government?s use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Responses will be held in a confidential manner.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business, Service-disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing contracts to identify two NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury? (FORE-SCI) sites to conduct research to replicate promising studies that could lead to new and effective treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI).

BACKGROUND

The NINDS is the lead NIH Institute for funding of SCI research, and the major supporter of basic science to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.  In the United States, the incidence of SCI is approximately 11,000 per year.  In recent years, many laboratories have reported anatomical and behavioral indications that spinal cord tissue can be preserved and/or spinal circuitry regenerated in animal SCI models.  These novel findings have led to the expectation that these strategies could be translated into effective clinical treatments for SCI.  While there remains some question as to how much and what type of preclinical data will predict success in clinical trials, there is agreement that proof of principle experiments should be replicated independently in multiple laboratories and/or in more than one type of animal model.  To date, a significant barrier to the development of promising avenues to treatments for patients is the lack of independent confirmation of preclinical results.  This inability to confirm and characterize potentially important outcomes with confidence has prevented new approaches from moving forward to clinical studies.

Thus, a significant number of potential therapeutic approaches to protect and repair the injured spinal cord have been identified, but few of these have reached the stage of clinical trials and none have been successfully translated into clinical practice.  Among several key factors limiting successful translation, assessing the quality and reproducibility of the reported results is one that can be directly addressed by attempting to replicate and confirm promising studies independently.  Based on a series of workshops, NINDS identified several unmet needs in the field of SCI and issued a Broad Agency Announcement in 2002 to develop contracts for FORE-SCI for training in SCI research methods, replication studies, and development of improved outcome assessments.  To date, two FORE-SCI contracts have supported attempts to replicate published preclinical studies that show promise for development into new treatments for SCI.  Unfortunately and unexpectedly, none of these attempts have succeeded in confirming the functional gains reported in the original studies.  A report published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine  emphasized the continuing need for replication of preclinical studies, naming this as one of six criteria for drug therapies entering clinical trials.  This report states that ?an emphasis on the replication of preclinical studies (replication studies) between laboratories is needed,? citing the FORE-SCI centers as prototypes for this effort.  Further, it suggests that the effort also include ?broader studies that not only replicate a previous study but also include novel elements in the experiment.?  The NINDS now seeks to re-compete this effort by soliciting proposals for two centers to undertake replication studies to confirm exciting findings from the spinal cord injury field.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTRACT

The proposed solicitation is to identify two NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury? (FORE-SCI) sites to conduct research to replicate promising studies that could lead to new and effective treatments for SCI.  The role of these two FORE-SCI centers will be to review and replicate novel treatments for SCI and to compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses.  It is anticipated that these centers will replicate at least one study per year, and make the results of these studies readily available to the SCI research community through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and other appropriate venues.  A successful program will demonstrate the capability to utilize multiple models of rodent spinal cord injuries, outcome measures and other experimental protocols to be used in the studies selected for replication.

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOALS OF THIS CONTRACT ARE:  

a.  To assess the scientific literature to select and then attempt to replicate promising, published preclinical studies of therapies that could lead to effective treatments for human SCI,
b.  To compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses,
c.  To promptly report the methodology and results of the replication study to the research community.

INFORMATION REQUESTED

Information in the following areas will aid in the design of the proposed solicitation.  We ask that interested organizations comment on critical criteria to be included in the solicitation.  The information supplied in response to this request need not be limited to these areas.

?  Appropriate length of time for completion of a replication study for (a) acute & subacute and (b) chronic therapeutic strategies.
?  Dissemination of results, positive or negative:  Will peer-reviewers approve pure replication studies and, if not, what other options dissemination venues are appropriate?
?  Best scientific approach to confirmation of published results (i.e., should studies be restricted to pure replication, vs. addition of control groups/models/outcomes or other experiment design elements).

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government?s use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received.

<SUBJECT>R -- Scientific Management skills course
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, Maryland and the Office of Intramural Research (OIR) plans to procure on a sole source basis with HWS Enterprises to develop and run a management skills course specifically oriented to scientists.  The objectives of the course will be to provide: assessments of management styles, through the use of those standard tests useful for scientific leadership (360 skill scope, Myers Briggs Type Inventory and Thomas ? Killman Conflict Inventory), assessment of leadership skills and self knowledge, training in the time management, training in conflict resolution, training in getting the best from teams, training in decision making, training in motivating others and identification and development of a plan for goal setting.  The contractor shall be knowledgeable of the theory and practice of education in management skills, demonstrated experience in development of a specific program appropriate for scientists, demonstrated expertise in facilitation of the program with scientists and extensive and demonstrated expertise in program evaluation and follow-up design. The course must be developed and presented by individuals experienced with the issues that scientists have and whom scientist will find credible.  NIH /OIR will be responsible for all costs associated with the logistics of the meeting, including but not limited to meeting room, audio visual, food, and local transportation, facilitating pre-session logistics with the participants, including ensuring their completion of the testing material.  The Contractor should deliver 30 copies of testing materials one month prior to the training.  Once the training has been completed, the Contractor should deliver five hard copies, along with a copy on a PC- compatible disk (in WordPerfect or  MS Word), of the final program evaluation and follow-up design.   NIH believes that the above reference firm is the only source that can provide this requirement. HWS is an expert in the development of management skills courses which are needed to continue the ongoing training needed to manage the increased complexities of modern biomedical research and the only firm to specifically design such a course for scientists.  HWS has designed courses for the PEW Scholars and is currently preparing a series for faculty at UCSF Medical School.  HWS has experience and knowledge related to the area of management skills.  NIH tenured and tenure-tract investigators to manage their laboratories, personnel and resources enable the tenure-track investigators to achieve success in becoming tenured.  HWS has successfully handled numerous courses over the past years, and have received excellent ratings from all the PIs who have taken the courses. However, if any other interested party believes that they can meet the requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of evaluation results.  The closing date will be 10 calendar days after publication.  All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor?s Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date.  If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non responsive.

<DESC>Full Architectural-Engineering design services for the analysis, planning and complete design for implementing physical configuration aspects of entry security programs requirements at operational entrances to the U.S. Social Security Administration?s Headquarters Buildings on the campus in Woodlawn, Maryland in response to Home Land Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), the Policy for a Common  Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors. It is the intent of this procurement to award a single contract to design the security screening program and stations in the entrance lobbies to the campus buildings. This design effort includes but is not limited to analysis of pedestrian traffic flow at each entrance, development of entry screening area configurations to accommodate the screening requirements of the population entering and exiting at each entrance, development of alternative security configurations and final construction documents (plans, specifications and cost estimate). 

Project is primarily Security Program design which shall include architectural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection and interior design but will also involve design for related minor repairs, alterations and renovations. This procurement will result in a single analysis, planning and design contract with an option for post construction award services.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing the work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  

Hazardous materials such as incidental asbestos and lead may be encountered in the existing facilities. The A-E?s Industrial Hygienist may be required to identify and quantify the types and locations of hazardous materials that may be abated during the construction project.  Therefore, knowledge of airborne pathogen concerns is required. 

In addition, certain projects may be designed and constructed in metric, System International (SI) units in accordance with Public Law 100-576, the Omnibus Trade & Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Metric Conversion Act, and Executive Order 12770.  A-E firms will be required to demonstrate proficiency in metric design. 

GSA?s CAD Deliverables Policy will be incorporated as requirements of the awarded contract. The detailed CAD Deliverable Policy may be accessed on the Internet at http://www.gsa.gov/midatlanticcadpolicy/.       Contractor agrees that all CAD, AutoCad drawings and related files, photographs, drawings, renderings, blueprints, specifications and/or other materials generated for use by the contractor on the project, whether in machine readable form or not, shall belong at all times to the General Services Administration (GSA) and shall be delivered to GSA at the times specified and within the schedules contained in the Agreement or at the termination of the Agreement, whichever occurs first.     

EVALUATION CRITERIA TO BE APPLIED IN THE SELECTION PROCESS IN DESCENDING ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, ARE AS FOLLOWS:

1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Specialized experience and technical competence in the programming, planning and design of pedestrian entry security stations and related interior design.

Examples might include, but not be limited to, entries at courthouses, secure office buildings, military compounds and border stations. In addition, address the following: a) Describe experience designing secure entries that use electronic validation systems to permit or deny entry to a building or facility, in particular HSPD12 experience. b)  Discuss how the firm will meet the requirement to comply with the GSA CAD policy (referenced above) and procedures. c) Describe the team?s familiarity with security criteria for the safety of personnel in Federal facilities and associated mitigation measures in design and construction related to standoff distances and blast resistant design for entrances to buildings. 

2. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS: Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.     

Submission Requirements: Provide resumes of proposed team members who will specifically serve as the Project Managers, Designers of Record (Architect, Civil Engineer, Structural Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer and Fire Protection Engineer), Interior Designer, Cost Estimator and Industrial Hygienist.

The last entry under Item H must read:     "I hereby certify that the firm(s) listed under Item 1 is a small business (if applicable) and meets the geographical limitations stated in the synopsis for this contract." 

Work performed under this contract will include Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this contract are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires the A/E firm and all consultants to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the contract.     The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.     Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

2. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

3. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.     Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified. Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain management and design team components, QC process; and to provide design solutions to actual/hypothetical projects, etc. Elaborate presentations are not desired. Note: A preliminary small business subcontracting plan will be required if a slated firm is a large business concern. 
Site visits will not be arranged during this period. Debriefing requests will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the submittal due date.

<CONTACT>Marion Weingartner, 011496118162606
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 0002 to the original announcement W912GB-07-R-0031 is to respond to questions received to date.   Q1:  Should we provide copies of all ACASS evaluation reports received over the past 3 years (for ALL referenced projects in the proposal) as an Attachment/Appendix with our submission?  A1:  Please submit past performance (ACASS summaries) within the past 3 years that are relevant to the work described in the announcement.  Q2.  Is NEPA applicable to the EUCOM AOR or Environmental Impact Assessments?  NEPA does not apply outside of the US, however we are required to follow good environmental practice by other regulations and Executive Orders. Generally, each country where we have long-standing installations will have negotiated, as part of the SOFA for  that country, a Final Governing Standards that dictates the environmental laws and regulations we have to comply with. Where we may not have developed those standards, other agreements may apply. We may be called upon occasionally to do Environmental Impa ct Assessments, or other studies that are similar.
