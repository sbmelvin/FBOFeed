<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the continuation of the My Community, Our Earth(MYCOE) in support of the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System (SERVIR) Globalprogram. The activities associated with this procurement will build upon past SERVIRcollaboration, current MyCOE work, and partnership with the United States Agency forInternational Development (USAID) and other public and private partners. The alreadyproven regional model for utilizing geographic technologies for capacity building will beextended globally to support and assist the growth of the overall SERVIR network.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the Association of American Geographers(AAG). Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1. AAG has served as the MyCOE Secretariat since its inception, collaborating withinternational academic organizations, government and nonprofit agencies, and privatefirms to further the advancement of geographic learning for capacity building andsustainable development.  USAID provides funding for SERVIR and is one of nine foundingsponsors of the MyCOE program. In the past, USAID sponsored MyCOEs biodiversityinitiative in Central America and highly supports the use of MyCOE for SERVIR globalexpansion. Furthermore, NASA benefits from being able to leverage an existing USAIDinvestment in MyCOE.2. This procurement is a follow-on for continuation of activities where AAG adapted theMyCOE program processes and infrastructure to support SERVIR in East Africa.  Moresignificantly it is a follow-on to the MyCOE program efforts sponsored by multiplefederal agencies since its inception in 2002 to present.  Award to any other entity wouldresult in duplication of costs that would not be recovered through competition and wouldfail to leverage the synergy and cost savings through leveraging the ongoing MYCOEprogram efforts.3. Funds provided to NASA from USAID to establish and expand the SERVIR system globallyincluded a stipulation that a significant portion of the funds be used for capacitybuilding. MyCOE uses a proven regional model to address how geographic data and tools maybe applied to critical regional needs and does so through improving the capacity withinthe regions. This model has been accepted by USAID as shown in their investment andcontinued support of the MyCOE program.4. SERVIR has already completed a successful collaboration with AAG implementing MyCOE inEast Africa and can leverage this experience as the program expands globally. SinceSERVIR has great familiarity with MyCOE, global expansion of the model will be mucheasier and greatly enhances SERVIRs ability to quickly satisfy some of the capacitybuilding requirements from USAID.5. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also themodel in the Americas for the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinationaleffort to build an earth observation system. For these reasons, it is of benefit to NASAto deepen its affiliation with the MyCOE program that is globally recognized and acceptedthus joining other sponsoring and contributing federal agencies and reputableinstitutions such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA), InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB), U.S. Department of State,USAID, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental SystemsResearch Institute, Inc. (ESRI), and many others.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon Thursday, January 12, 2012.

The current design backload contains multiple small and medium size projects that vary widely in nature.  It is not the intent of this contract to design major Military Construction Program projects.<br><br>EVALUATION: The Governments selection of the best value contractor is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s). Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. <br>FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services) evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team.

The key positions should include: Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors. Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES. <br>FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s). Particularly work on National Guard projects and Army or Air Force projects.<br>FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years) evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules. <br>FACTOR 4 -Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time) evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods. <br>FACTOR 5- Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to Hartford, CT and knowledge of this locality) evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from Hartford, CT and the extent of the firms knowledge of  Connecticut and knowledge/experience concerning state, and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract. <br>FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months) in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement. <br>FACTOR 7- Small Business Participation evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner. <br>FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, more important than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted equal. FACTORS 1 & 2 are also significantly more important than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted equal and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal. Relative to FACTOR 5 Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for teams with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a project team(s) is not co-located.<br><br>SUBMISSION FORMAT: Three (3) complete and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.

<p>The Division has an urgent need for support concerning scientific optimal coordination and integration of the numerous ongoing scientific initiatives that depend on an infrastructure which includes dozens of distinct laboratories, clinics, survey research contracts, computer support contracts and dozens of multi-institution consortia. It is critically important to use this complex research infrastructure effectively so that the Division responds quickly to priorities identified by the NCI and NIH leadership, as well as in the training program for junior scientific staff.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W91CRB-08-R-0073 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 11 Aug 2008 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (RDECOM STTC). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, "Medical Modeling and Simulation". Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Matthew Hackett, 407-384-5349; matthew.g.hackett@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: Mr. Justin H. Woolsey, Contract Specialist, 407-384-3942, justin.woolsey@us.army.mil, US Army RDECOM, U.S. Army Contracting Command - APG (Orlando Team), 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Nikia S. Jelks, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the research effort will be to incorporate Virtual Patient technology with Virtual Worlds technology. The effort will build upon the technological advances seen recently in both of these technology areas. The targeted training population should be the Combat Medic; however, the potential use will extend to Combat Lifesavers, Combat nurses, and Combat doctors. RDECOM-STTC is looking for research in this area to augment the current training curriculum. Specifically: <br>1.	High fidelity avatars capable of exhibiting subtle signs and symptoms present due to a variety of medical pathologies<br>2.	Variable levels of detail, in order to render scenes with many assets / avatars.  Display of avatars should range from a low level of detail necessary in high population areas to a higher level of detail needed during practitioner / patient interactions<br>3.	Patient avatars tied to a physiology model in order to provide accurate, physiological patient response due to medical intervention<br>4.	Technology to deliver relevant patient - practitioner interactions in order to help train communications skills, triage capabilities, diagnostic steps, and other medically relevant training tasks. <br>5.	Capability to create scenarios within the Virtual World, such as the arrival of a patient at a military hospital<br>6.	Multiplayer capability in order to allow for collaboration of medical personnel or supervision from senior medical personnel or instructor<br>7.	Persistent environment allowing for the potential training regarding a continuum of care<br>8.	Environment must be capable of supporting up to ~50 participants, with ~20 being <br>display simultaneously within a given scene<br>9.	The environment must be accurate to current military medical installations, such as a forward operating base, a battalion aid station, a military hospital, etc...<br>10.	Relevant scenarios based upon common military medical problems, including blast injury, PTSD, TBI, etc...<br><br>The planned method for accomplishing the research in this area is to utilize a phase approach. Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach / solution address a Basic Award (Phase 1 / Year 1) and up to two priced options. The white paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit / fee / overhead. <br><br>PHASE I.  Phase I effort will begin integration of Virtual World and Virtual Patient technology. Additional military medical assets, including environments, instruments, and avatars, will be developed. Interaction capabilities will be developed as well. An initial delivery of the software will be delivered at the end of phase I. <br><br>Phase I will be a 12-month effort and funding will be approximately $500,000.00. <br><br>PHASE II. During phase II, the scenario driven aspects of the program will be developed. Additionally, an extensive user evaluation will be done during phase II. The evaluation will test using military medical professions, with the potential for civilian medical professions as well. <br><br>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase II will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $500,000, subject to budgeting constraints.<br><br>PHASE III. Based on the results of the phase II evaluations, the program will be further refined. Additional scenarios will be created based upon user feedback. The end result of phase III should be a mature software package, ready to be transitioned. <br><br>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase III will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $600,000, subject to budgeting constraints. <br><br>Reference Documents are provided at http://www.rdecom.army.mil/STTC/baa.html<br><br>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  <br><br>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: <br><br>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the objectives identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1600 EDT 18 Jan 2012. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address the objectives for both Phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitch, excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II and III as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:<br>(1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.    Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  <br>(2) Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed solution will meet the goal of the research topic.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential approach and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving the Medical Modeling and Simulation should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered. <br>(3) Personnel: The qualifications, experience, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for the proposal objectives.<br> (4) Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offeror's history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.<br> (5) Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.<br><br>Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation.   White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted. <br><br>Upon completion of white paper evaluations, Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received. Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part. Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter to the qualified offeror(s), who best meet the program objectives. If proposals are solicited, proposals are due NLT 8 Feb 2012.  The requirements for proposal preparation and submission can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=8 <br><br>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding. The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission. Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitutes the Government's solicitation for this effort.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Goddard Space FlightCenter (GSFC) is soliciting information through this Request for Information (RFI) forwork on the planned upcoming competitive acquisition entitled Instrument Systems andTechnology Engineering Services (ISTES). This is not a follow-on nor a replacement forany previously existing contract. NASA solicits responses from interested parties inregard to vendor capability and interest. NASA is seeking capability statements from bothlarge and small businesses to aid in the acquisition planning for this requirement. SmallBusinesses interested in this opportunity may decide to partner in a joint venture withother small and/or large businesses in order to meet the requirements in the futureacquisition. SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  NASA GSFC is chartered to expand the knowledge of the earthand its environment, the solar system, and the universe through observations from space.To this end, the GSFCs primary emphasis is in scientific investigation, in thedevelopment and operation of space systems, and in the advancement of essentialtechnologies. In accomplishing this responsibility, GSFC has undertaken a broad programof scientific research, both theoretical and experimental, in the study of spacephenomena and earth sciences. The program ranges from basic research to flight experimentdevelopments and from mission operations to data analysis. Within the GSFC, the AppliedEngineering Technology Directorate (AETD) provides and advances discipline expertise toimplement all phases of a product life cycle from germination of the measurement conceptswithin the science laboratory, through mission definition, design, manufacture,integration, test, operation, and processing of the resultant data. AETD is comprised offive engineering divisions: the Mechanical Systems Division (MSD), the Instrument Systemsand Technology Division (ISTD), the Electrical Engineering Division (EED), theInformation Systems Division (ISD), and the Mission Engineering and Systems Analysis(MESA) Division. Additionally, the Instrument Management and Systems Office (IMSO) is acomponent of the AETD. This planned acquisition is to provide a broad range of technologyrelated engineering support services and related multidiscipline support to the IMSO,MSD, ISTD, EED, ISD, and MESA. This support was previously and continues, for the timebeing, to be performed under a variety of GSFC contracts.The scope of work under consideration for purposes of this RFI includes the performanceof engineering services and related services to ISTD and related organizations throughoutGSFC, as required, for the formulation, design, development, fabrication, integration,testing, verification, and operations of space flight and ground system hardware andsoftware, including development and validation of new technologies to enable future spaceand science missions. Currently the ISTD gets its support through contracts held withinand managed by other division and other directorates. Those contracts include but are notlimited to: the GSFC Contracts MSES IIA, Contract Number NNG07CA21C with SGT; METS II,Contract Number NNG10CR16C with ARSC; ESES Interim, Contract Number NNG10CR08C with MEI;ETIS, Contract Number NNG08CA01C with Analex; SES, contract Number NNG10CR25C withColumbus Technology & Services; and PAAC III, Contract Number NNG09DA02C with ARSC.1.2 PURPOSE OF RFI - NASA solicits responses from interested parties in regard to vendorcapability and interest. NASA is seeking capability statements from both large and smallbusinesses to aid in the acquisition planning for this requirement. This RFI is not to beconstrued as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for theinformation submitted in response.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking sources to provide a NHLBI Leadership Lab which will include traditional cohort learning activities, as well as challenging assignments and management involvement. The program is to be designed as a leadership development program that includes nine one-day cohort sessions every three to four weeks over a 7-month period and non-classroom components for 24 participants. The contractor shall provide leadership development services to enhance leadership competencies and training needs identified by participants and the NHLBI. This SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this SS. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this SS. This FedBizOps SS is strictly for market research purposes only. As a result of this SS, the Government may issue a RFQ, however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the SS.
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services <br />and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 million. <br /><br />Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the NHLBI may conduct a competitive procurement or negotiate on a Sole Source basis with The Results Leadership Group, LLC, 7960 Old Georgetown Road, Suite 10C, Bethesda, MD 20814-2445 and subsequently award a single contract with two one-year option periods.</p>
<p>All eligible companies responding to this SS Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of contract.</p>
<p>NOTE: if the SS results into a small business set aside solicitation, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for services, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Leadership development is a foundation of succession planning at the National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The NHLBI Succession Plan focuses on training and development initiatives to prepare high potential employees for leadership roles. To address the NHLBI leadership development needs in a timely and comprehensive manner and to provide necessary training and experience to high potential leaders resulting in their career growth, NHLBI has approved a new leadership development program titled the NHLBI Leadership Lab.</p>
<p>The NHLBI Leadership Lab will include traditional cohort learning activities, as well as challenging assignments and management involvement. The program is designed as a leadership development program that includes nine one-day cohort sessions every three to four weeks over a 7-month period and non-classroom components for 24 participants.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide leadership development services to enhance leadership competencies and training needs identified by participants and the NHLBI.</p>
<p>Program design must include:</p>
<p>1. Interest Based Negotiation: Based upon the principles introduced in Roger Fisher's seminal text, Getting to Yes, Interest based negotiation is a methodology designed to produce outcomes superior to those typically achieved in "position-based" negotiation (i.e., negotiations focused on fixed positions and opposing viewpoints, which often result in compromises or impasses). Interest based negotiation is also designed to improve the efficiency (or reduce the transactional costs) of negotiations and collaborations.</p>
<p>2. Results Based Accountability TM: Results Based Accountability TM is a framework and set of skills for ensuring both disciplined decision-making and accountability for achieving desired results. Key principles include the use of (1) data to align day-to-day decision making with the achievement of desired ends and (2) transparency to drive innovation by surfacing and challenging assumptions.</p>
<p>3. Situational Leadership: Method that instructs NHLBI's managers in the skill of diagnosing an individual's development level on a specific goal or task, then adapting their leadership style to match the situation. It offers a strategy for aligning individual goals to NHLBI's goals. The role of the situational leader is to provide direct reports with whatever it takes-goals, direction, training, support, feedback, or recognition-to develop their skills, motivation, and confidence. Situational leadership creates a partnership between managers and staff that enables staff to feel empowered.</p>
<p>4. Strengths-Based Leadership: Effective leadership is about a leader maximizing their strengths. According to research conducted by Gallup, effective leaders must know their strengths and invest in others' strengths, get people with the right strengths on their group, and understand and meet the four basic needs of those who look to them for leadership</p>
<p>The contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Manage the NHLBI Leadership Lab that results in agile leaders who have the skills to lead in a culture of dynamic change.</p>
<p>2. Provide a draft program design to include proposed content for each session.</p>
<p>3. Provide the processes and steps the contractor followed in developing the initiatives for the Leadership Lab.</p>
<p>4. Provide copies of content being developed for each session.</p>
<p>5. Provide a meeting with the Contracting Officer's Representative and NHLBI management&nbsp;(two weeks prior to the first training session) to define, analyze and finalize work processes, operating procedures, and organizational development.</p>
<p>6. Develop and conduct nine full day sessions over seven months beginning in early May 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Design and administer 360 Degree Leadership Survey and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&copy; which includes the electronic system (program), the evaluation, communication, and the final analysis and distribution of results prior to start of first session by a certified administrator.<br /><br />8. Provide a cadre of coaches to facilitate a minimum of six hours of executive coaching per participant with experience and knowledge in evaluating 360 Degree and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&copy; Assessments.</p>
<p>9. Make recommendations for programs and initiatives that align with the NHLBI leadership development strategies.</p>
<p>10. Provide weekly progress reports detailing activities performed during the reporting period.</p>
<p>11. Develop strategies; provide recommendations and input on leadership planning and programmatic activities; complete projects by established deadlines; arrive on time and attend meetings as scheduled.</p>
<p>12. Define measurable outcomes and evaluate success of NHLBI leadership and training efforts.</p>
<p>13. Provide recommendations to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative on the resources' utilization, and the facilitation of their implementation.</p>
<p>14. Identify and leverage best practices in leadership development to address these needs.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement or submit a response. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however; all responses received before the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>Companies that can perform the requirements above are requested to submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, data, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the task (s) as described above. The capability statement shall include the following:</p>

Drill Resistance (SINT DRMS):  Use Resistograph technology to determine the extent of the deterioration of stone, mortar, brick or concrete.  Establish user determined parameters for rate of advance and rate of rotation, and apply force measured for the 3mm drill bit to advance to a preset depth.  Identify variations in resistance by the onboard sensors and the graphed data to determine indirect compressive strength (50 to 50,000 psi), depth of deterioration or exfoliation, and location of voids.  <br><br>b.	 60x Field Microscope/ 360 degree Boroscope:  Where access is available, use flexible and fixed barrel boroscopes with integral lights and 360 degree rotating heads to look beyond the surface. <br><br>c.

The test method will be used to determine the quality and soundness of masonry units such as stone and brick, detect voids or decay; determine the thickness of sections; detect debonding or delaminating; and determine the depth of cracks or other flaws.<br>  <br>d.	Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR):  Employ a number of GPR units and antenna to detect the thickness of masonry materials, subsurface anomalies, and changes in the density of stone and other masonry units.  Radar signals of varying frequencies are imparted to the material and the reflected wave form evaluated.<br><br>e.

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />52.233-2 Service of Protest</p>
<p>(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed direct with an agency and copies of any protest that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt form Military Sealift Fleet Support Command, N10 Attn: Elloise Hitshew, 471 "C" Street, Naval Station Norfolk, VA 23511.</p>
<p>(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.233-2 Service of Protest</p>
<p>Interested parties may request an independent review of their protest as an alternative to consideration by the Contracting Officer or as an appeal of the contracting officer's decision on their protest. See FAR 33.103. Requests for independent review shall be addressed to Code N10 or N10X Military Sealift Command, 914 Charles Morris Ct SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20398-5540. MSFSC encourages potential protesters to discuss their concerns with the Contracting Officer prior to filing a protest.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Luis Alfonso Pinz&oacute;n Corcho<br />Manager for Projects and Civil Works<br />Aguas de Cartagena, S.A. E.S.P.<br />Gerencia de Proyectos y Obras<br />Planta de Tratamiento del Acueducto<br />Barrio Paraguay, Loma del Mari&oacute;n<br />Transversal 45 No. 26a -160<br />Cartagena de Indias D.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance for the start-up of a comprehensive wastewater treatment system for the city of Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coast.</p>
<p>ACUACAR has operated as the water public services provider for the city of Cartagena since 1995. With the support of financing from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) that entailed the backing of the Colombian government, the Grantee and the City of Cartagena have jointly invested more than $300 million in the design and implementation of the Master Plan for Water and Sewerage for Cartagena, of which $85 million have been invested since 2003 in the design and construction of a new wastewater treatment plant in Punta Canoa; a collector system that will bring wastewater to the new plant, including a 19.3 kilometer conveyance pipeline and a pumping station; a 1.6 kilometer terrestrial pipeline connecting the wastewater treatment plant to the marine outfall; and a 4.3 kilometer marine outfall that will discharge treated water into the Caribbean Sea. Many of the primary components of the wastewater system have been completed and the physical installation of the submarine outfall is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2011. The remainder of the primary infrastructure was built and installed over two years ago; the overall system can operate once the outfall is in place.<br /><br />The TA has two main objectives: (i) to provide technical assistance during the critical phase of integrating subsystems and the start-up of the new wastewater system and (ii) the creation of the environmental water quality baseline and design of an ongoing water quality monitoring program, including recommendations for environmental remediation in the Cienaga de la Virgen, a sea inlet surrounded by the city and suburbs. This TA ensures that Cartagena's new wastewater system will start operating in the shortest possible time. Moreover, this TA will also be an input for the expansion of the water and wastewater treatment system in the city of Cartagena. Currently the Grantee also has plans for expansion and construction of a new water supply treatment plant to the immediate south of Cartagena. It is expected that the design and construction of the expansion will also benefit from this TA, especially as it relates to automation and control, monitoring and equipment necessary for operations.<br /><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $513,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5 pm on February 13, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Olugboyega Akintobi<br />Oando Gas &amp; Power<br />Tender Committee <br />9th Floor<br />No. 2 Ajose Adeogun Street<br />Victoria Island, Lagos<br />Phone No: +234 (0)7057286660</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform a feasibility study to assist the Grantee in its effort to develop a natural gas transmission and distribution network.</p>
<p>Nigeria faces a developmental challenge of efficiently supplying energy to a growing number of industrial and commercial consumers in the country. The Grantee has made notable progress towards addressing the problem through the ongoing development of a privately owned and operated gas pipeline network. The Grantee presently serves about 90 commercial clients in the Lagos area through its 62 mile pipeline, owned and operated by its wholly owned subsidiary, Gaslink Nigeria Limited. The Grantee is also developing an additional 80 miles of pipeline to serve customers in Akwa Ibom and Cross River States through another wholly owned subsidiary, Eastern Horizon Gas Company. Combined, these gas transmission and distribution systems represent an investment by the Grantee of more than $250 million.</p>
<p>The Grantee now seeks to expand its customer base to the north and west of Lagos where it aims to reach customers in the commercial centers of Ibadan and Ilorin, and the densely populated cities of Iwo, Oshogbo, and Ogbomoho. The Project entails the development of a 280 mile natural gas pipeline originating at the Nigerian Gas Company's Escravos-Lagos pipeline, which will supply gas to the Project, in Ogun State. From there, the Project runs northeast through Ibadan and Ogbomosho, Oyo State, and ends in Ilorin, Kwara State. The Project also features two spurs from the main pipeline, one running southeast from Ibadan, the second running southeast from Ogbomosho to Oshogbo, Osun State, and then east into Ekiti State. Where the Project passes through urban areas, gas distribution infrastructure will also be developed to deliver gas directly to high volume customers.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a combination of a $446,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and a $380,000 cost share provided by the Grantee.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00pm, Local (Lagos) Time, February 23, 2012</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

In response to the above solicitation, the following answers to questions are given:

Q1. It seems that many veteran companies are being awarded the contracts only to pass the work on to other companies.  Are there any steps that will be taken to ensure that this is not going to happen? Is the VA going to ensure that the licensed personnel are part of the awarded company?

A1.  VAAR 852.215-70 Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned small business evaluation Factors (Dec 2009) has been added to this solicitation; additionally, as mentioned in part 2 of this solicitation, Evaluation factors are as follows:

1.	Price: (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable)
2.	Past Performance: Offeror shall provide three (3) verifiable references of customers that have been serviced with similar type service specified in the referenced statement of work or proof of satisfactorily providing these types of services in the past.

Q2. If possible can we ask questions to the maintenance personnel to see if any lifts are required to reach any fire alarm devices? 

A2.  All questions will be directed to the contracting officer and the contracting officer will gather information and submit all answers as an amendment to the solicitation so that all information is available to everyone.

A walk through is required. This requirement is added so that prospective vendors can tour the facility and ensure they know what the specifications and requirements are. A walk through is scheudled for: January 5, 2011 - Orlando Location 5201 Raymond Street, Orlando Fl  32803 - We will meet at the back motorpool at 10:00 AM.

January 6, 2011 - Viera Location 2900 Veterans Way, Viera Fl, 32940
We will meet at the main security desk at 10:00 AM.

All answers to questions during the walk-thru will be posted via amendment to this solicitation.

 The site visit will last approximately 1-2 hours. 

Q3.  It doesn't appear that there is a quantity provided for the fire extinguishers? 

A3.  Orlando Location:  87 Extinguishers, Viera Location:  44 Extinguishers.

Q4.  Who is currently providing the service? Is there an incumbent contractor or is the service being done by the government?

A4.  Emergency Planning Management, Inc

Q5.  I see in the document it states Fire Sprinkler and Fire Alarm specifically, and then includes the kitchen hoods and fire extinguishers in the scope of work.  I just want to make sure this is accurate and the kitchen hood fire suppression and the fire extinguishers are included as part of this contract?

A6.  Part 2 of this solicitation (scope of work) has been modified to spell out the kitchen hood fire supression systems and the fire extinguisher maintenance to be consistant with Part 6 of this solicitation.

<DESC>Questions addressing the changed areas; page 18 section 1.2.4, page 28 section 3.1.1 and page 95 CDRL A005 will be accepted until 12/2/2012 at 3 pm EST. <br /><br />Questions received with response:<br /><br />1. Q.&nbsp; The schedule was briefed as 30 days from RFP release to proposal submission. Would the government consider providing the anticipated 30 days from RFP release to proposal submission? Particularly with the upcoming holiday, nine working days and fourteen calendar days provides limited time to provide a detailed proposal.<br /><br />A.&nbsp; There was no briefing of 30 days from release. The only referral to 30 days was regarding the mobilization period. Proposals remain due on 1/11/12 at 3:00 pm EST.<br /><br /><br />2. Q.&nbsp; &nbsp;The SOW 1.2.1 states that all personnel are considered Key and resumes must be presented at beginning of mobilization. Answers to Pre-Solicitation Questions and Answers Question 29 states Resumes, pricing, reps and certs are excluded from the page limit. RFP Page 163 implements EO #13495 Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers under SCA. With invoking EO#13495, the incumbent personnel will be given the right of first refusal, therefore submission of resumes with the proposal invokes a significant advantage for the incumbent. Are resumes for Key Personel required to be submitted with proposal or at the start of mobilization? <br /><br />A.&nbsp; Resumes are due at the beginning of the Mobilization period as 3. Is there a deadline for submission of questions on the final RFP?<br /><br />3. Q.&nbsp; Is there a deadline for submission of questions on the final RFP?<br /><br />A.&nbsp; The pre-solicitation notice with a draft SOW was posted on FedBizOPs 12/1/11. The notice also stated that questions would not be addressed at the pre-solicitation conference and must be submitted in writing (e-mail) by 12/16 at 4:00 pm. This allowed 15 days for submission of questions. Three minor changes were made in the final release and no further technical questions are entertained unless specifically addressing one of these changed areas. The changed areas as indicated in the solicitation are: page 18 section 1.2.4, page 28 section 3.1.1 and page 95 CDRL A005. Therefore, no further questions will be accepted after 1500 (EST) 1/2/2012. <br /><br /><br />

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W91CRB-08-R-0073 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 11 Aug 2008 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (RDECOM STTC). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, "Medical Modeling and Simulation". Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Matthew Hackett, 407-384-5349; matthew.g.hackett@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: Mr. Justin H. Woolsey, Contract Specialist, 407-384-3942, justin.woolsey@us.army.mil, US Army RDECOM, U.S. Army Contracting Command - APG (Orlando Team), 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Nikia S. Jelks, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the research effort will be to incorporate Virtual Patient technology with Virtual Worlds technology. The effort will build upon the technological advances seen recently in both of these technology areas. The targeted training population should be the Combat Medic; however, the potential use will extend to Combat Lifesavers, Combat nurses, and Combat doctors. RDECOM-STTC is looking for research in this area to augment the current training curriculum. Specifically: <br>1.	High fidelity avatars capable of exhibiting subtle signs and symptoms present due to a variety of medical pathologies<br>2.	Variable levels of detail, in order to render scenes with many assets / avatars.  Display of avatars should range from a low level of detail necessary in high population areas to a higher level of detail needed during practitioner / patient interactions<br>3.	Patient avatars tied to a physiology model in order to provide accurate, physiological patient response due to medical intervention<br>4.	Technology to deliver relevant patient - practitioner interactions in order to help train communications skills, triage capabilities, diagnostic steps, and other medically relevant training tasks. <br>5.	Capability to create scenarios within the Virtual World, such as the arrival of a patient at a military hospital<br>6.	Multiplayer capability in order to allow for collaboration of medical personnel or supervision from senior medical personnel or instructor<br>7.	Persistent environment allowing for the potential training regarding a continuum of care<br>8.	Environment must be capable of supporting up to ~50 participants, with ~20 being <br>display simultaneously within a given scene<br>9.	The environment must be accurate to current military medical installations, such as a forward operating base, a battalion aid station, a military hospital, etc...<br>10.	Relevant scenarios based upon common military medical problems, including blast injury, PTSD, TBI, etc...<br><br>The planned method for accomplishing the research in this area is to utilize a phase approach. Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach / solution address a Basic Award (Phase 1 / Year 1) and up to two priced options. The white paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit / fee / overhead. <br><br>PHASE I.  Phase I effort will begin integration of Virtual World and Virtual Patient technology. Additional military medical assets, including environments, instruments, and avatars, will be developed. Interaction capabilities will be developed as well. An initial delivery of the software will be delivered at the end of phase I. <br><br>Phase I will be a 12-month effort and funding will be approximately $500,000.00. <br><br>PHASE II. During phase II, the scenario driven aspects of the program will be developed. Additionally, an extensive user evaluation will be done during phase II. The evaluation will test using military medical professions, with the potential for civilian medical professions as well. <br><br>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase II will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $500,000, subject to budgeting constraints.<br><br>PHASE III. Based on the results of the phase II evaluations, the program will be further refined. Additional scenarios will be created based upon user feedback. The end result of phase III should be a mature software package, ready to be transitioned. <br><br>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase III will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $600,000, subject to budgeting constraints. <br><br>Reference Documents are provided at http://www.rdecom.army.mil/STTC/baa.html<br><br>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  <br><br>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: <br><br>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the objectives identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1600 EDT 18 Jan 2012. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address the objectives for both Phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitch, excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II and III as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:<br>(1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W91CRB-08-R-0073 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 11 Aug 2008 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (RDECOM STTC). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, "Medical Modeling and Simulation". Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Matthew Hackett, 407-384-5349; matthew.g.hackett@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: Mr. Justin H. Woolsey, Contract Specialist, 407-384-3942, justin.woolsey@us.army.mil, US Army RDECOM, U.S. Army Contracting Command - APG (Orlando Team), 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Nikia S. Jelks, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the research effort will be to incorporate Virtual Patient technology with Virtual Worlds technology. The effort will build upon the technological advances seen recently in both of these technology areas. The targeted training population should be the Combat Medic; however, the potential use will extend to Combat Lifesavers, Combat nurses, and Combat doctors. RDECOM-STTC is looking for research in this area to augment the current training curriculum. Specifically: <br>1.	High fidelity avatars capable of exhibiting subtle signs and symptoms present due to a variety of medical pathologies<br>2.	Variable levels of detail, in order to render scenes with many assets / avatars.  Display of avatars should range from a low level of detail necessary in high population areas to a higher level of detail needed during practitioner / patient interactions<br>3.	Patient avatars tied to a physiology model in order to provide accurate, physiological patient response due to medical intervention<br>4.	Technology to deliver relevant patient - practitioner interactions in order to help train communications skills, triage capabilities, diagnostic steps, and other medically relevant training tasks. <br>5.	Capability to create scenarios within the Virtual World, such as the arrival of a patient at a military hospital<br>6.	Multiplayer capability in order to allow for collaboration of medical personnel or supervision from senior medical personnel or instructor<br>7.	Persistent environment allowing for the potential training regarding a continuum of care<br>8.	Environment must be capable of supporting up to ~50 participants, with ~20 being <br>display simultaneously within a given scene<br>9.	The environment must be accurate to current military medical installations, such as a forward operating base, a battalion aid station, a military hospital, etc...<br>10.	Relevant scenarios based upon common military medical problems, including blast injury, PTSD, TBI, etc...<br><br>The planned method for accomplishing the research in this area is to utilize a phase approach. Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach / solution address a Basic Award (Phase 1 / Year 1) and up to two priced options. The white paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit / fee / overhead. <br><br>PHASE I.  Phase I effort will begin integration of Virtual World and Virtual Patient technology. Additional military medical assets, including environments, instruments, and avatars, will be developed. Interaction capabilities will be developed as well. An initial delivery of the software will be delivered at the end of phase I. <br><br>Phase I will be a 12-month effort and funding will be approximately $500,000.00. <br><br>PHASE II. During phase II, the scenario driven aspects of the program will be developed. Additionally, an extensive user evaluation will be done during phase II. The evaluation will test using military medical professions, with the potential for civilian medical professions as well. <br><br>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase II will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $500,000, subject to budgeting constraints.<br><br>PHASE III. Based on the results of the phase II evaluations, the program will be further refined. Additional scenarios will be created based upon user feedback. The end result of phase III should be a mature software package, ready to be transitioned. <br><br>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase III will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $600,000, subject to budgeting constraints. <br><br>Reference Documents are provided at http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=8<br><br>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  <br><br>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: <br><br>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the objectives identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1600 EDT 18 Jan 2012. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address the objectives for both Phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitch, excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This request for information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI, and is in no way obligated by the information received.<br><br>1.0 SCOPE:<br><br>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed. The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<br><br>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain technical and cost information from manufacturers regarding the availability of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government-off -the- Shelf (GOTS) modular compact aerostat and airship payload deployment units. The purpose of this aerostat/airship platform system is to obtain potential solutions to provide small tactical units with an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability. Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will be considered. <br><br>This requirement includes operators and Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to provide FSR support and new equipment training. The aerostat/airship shall provide for remote, safe, persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. The aerostat/airship must stay on station even in less favorable environmental conditions that would ground a tethered or untethered unit of comparable size, features, or classification.<br><br>The platform shall have a capability for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL). The platform shall be a lighter than air (LTA) platform that is easily deployable in either a mobile (untethered) or tethered state. The Airship shall remain functional while flying even in non-ideal conditions. The Airship must fly in winds up to, but not less than, 25 knot winds. The system shall be deployable utilizing no more than two Soldiers. The Airship shall have an active onboard systems ("smart aerostat") its fins will continue to use their movable surfaces to stabilize and trim the aerostat/airship, safety systems will prevent fly always in the event that the tether line was cut.<br><br>Mechanically, the Airship platform shall incorporate a modular design for ease of manufacturing and flexible payload configuration. The configurable sensor pod can house a wide array of active or passive sensing devices. A communications interface and main system power is available from the aerostat's/airship's underbelly wire harness for command, feedback and sensor power. System components are further broken out into separate gondolas. The Airship housing shall contain computing and system internal sensors and the black gondola houses propulsion means. Vital system components are further protected by ballistic fabric to mitigate the risk of small arms fire and even if the envelope takes direct hit the Aerostat/Airship can still fly safely for another 30 minutes. The airship envelope contains cascaded safety systems to allow for easy retrieval in case of an emergency. A protective tarp to tether down the airship during inflation & inclement weather is required. For safe launches and landing there are two key features implemented into the Propulsion gondola, sensors that calculate if the system is being held and a landing skid to keep the motors out of ground debris. The software should have transparent safety features that do not allow the end user to put the system at risk. Other software features based on sensor feedback like automated inflation is desired to assure that little training is necessary to successfully deploy and use the Aerostat/Airship. <br><br>2.0 Requirements:<br><br>Dimensions: The Aerostat/Airship <br>a.

<DESC>This is an amendment to Solicitation/Contract No. DTFAWA-12-R-08591.This amendment is to include a suspense date for all questions from those potential offerors who attended the Site Survey Visits.  All questions are to be submitted in writing, by email, no later than January 11, 2012 to the Contracting Officer: Katherine.Petito-Peverall@faa.govThere are no other changes to this Market Survey.

Posting (brief abstract): 	The FAA is responsible for aviation weather observation services at designated locations, primarily airports, throughout the United States including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. Since March 1995, the FAA has satisfied this responsibility through the use of the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), or the Aviation Weather Observing System (AWOS), FAA employees and contract weather observer personnel. 
Presently, the Contract Weather Observation (CWO) program utilizes 15 contractors, predominantly small and very small businesses, which provide weather observation services at 148 contract sites in FAA-owned or FAA-leased locations. 
The following summary represents the CWO locations aligned within the three (3) Service Areas.  They will be further divided into groups.  
- Eastern Service Area contains approximately 54 sites within the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  
- Central Service Area contains approximately 48 sites within the following states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.
- Western Service Area contains approximately 24 sites within the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, and Hawaii.  
Alaska Service Area contains approximately 22 sites within the state of Alaska. 

Objective:
The objective of this Market Survey/RFI is to solicit feedback from sources capable of performing aviation weather observation services.  It is the FAA's intent to inform industry of a planned competitive contract(s) (estimated at over $100 million dollars) that will provide for aviation weather observer personnel to augment the ASOS and AWOS at selected airports throughout the United States, including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. The small business community primarily provides the CWO Program its current weather observation services.  The FAA is now seeking to identify potential small businesses that have the experience and qualifications necessary to perform the services required. No solicitation package is currently available.  However, the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 541990.  This future contracting opportunity will be set-aside for competition among small businesses unless the FAA determines that no adequate competition or capable small business sources exists. The FAA encourages subcontracting and teaming arrangements by all participants.   
The FAA seeks to identify small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that possess the following knowledge and experience:
1. Knowledge of FAA and National Weather Service (NWS) Orders, directives and policy relating to CWO services.
2. Knowledge, familiarity or experience with ASOS or AWOS.
3. Knowledge and understanding of the National Airspace System (NAS).
4. Previous experience providing or managing aviation weather observation service at multiple locations.
5. Previous experience, knowledge or management capability for a small business to manage other small businesses and/or small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in a contractual arrangement that would include handling payroll and reports for multiple locations or subcontractors. 
6.  The ability to provide and manage an aviation weather observation-training program.
For all questions related to this market survey, revised SOW, and Vendor Q & A's please contact the Contracting Officer:
Katherine Petito-Peverall, Contracting Officer, AJA-46katherine.petito-peverall@faa.gov(202) 385-8591
Vendors are encouraged to submit all/any questions NLT than October 13, 2011.

<SUBJECT>A--Technical Assistance Services for Communities (TASC)
<SOLNBR>SOL-HQ-12-00004
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>Nicole Pratt
<DESC>PurposeThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research and gather information from industry on technical assistance to community members to facilitate their involvement in the environmental decisions affecting their community.  The purpose of this contract is to be able to provide supplemental, non-advocacy technical assistance services at no cost to communities to empower them to substantively participate in addressing environmental issues and actions which impact their community.This RFI is solely for informational, planning and market research purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor do they affect a potential offeror?s ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation.  The U.S. Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice.  Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to this process.  All data gathered shall remain the property of EPA.  All cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.BackgroundFor the last twenty-five years, the Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI, more commonly known as Superfund) has supported independent, non-advocacy, technical assistance programs that augment the technical assistance provided to communities by EPA staff.  Such assistance has been provided through Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs), the Technical Assistance Services for Communities (TASC) contract and, formerly, the Technical Outreach Services for Communities (TOSC) program that was administered through the Hazardous Substance Research Centers.  TAGs, while statutorily mandated, are limited to communities affected by National Priorities List (NPL) sites.  Therefore, TASC and its predecessor, TOSC, were developed to provide similar assistance to communities near hazardous waste sites ineligible for TAGs.   While support under the TAG program remains narrowly confined to the communities at NPL sites, the TASC program has expanded to encompass NPL and  non-NPL sites under the Superfund program, and  other  EPA offices and programs, such as Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse Office (FFRRO), Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) (which manages the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  (RCRA) program), Office of Water (OW), Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ), and the Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) program.  The areas of technical assistance potentially sought under this requirement are as follows. (Please refer to the attached draft Statement of Work for a detailed description of the requirements for each task area.) ?	Technical Assistance Needs Assessment?	Community Advisory Group/Panel Formation?	Meeting Facilitation?	Technical Document Review and Interpretation?	Presentations?	Training?	Workshop Organizing and Delivery?	Community Educational Materials?	Communication Materials, and Program Analysis and Support?	Project Reports?	Community-Based Environmental Job-Training ProgramsQuestions for IndustryAs part of our market research and acquisition planning efforts, EPA requests firms with expertise and experience related to the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) provide feedback pertaining to the following questions:       1. Please indicate your small business socioeconomic classification if you are a small business firm.    2. As written, are the requirements outlined in the attached draft SOW clear and understandable? If not, what specific areas require additional clarity and in what way?3.  Please provide any information that needs to be considered from an acquisition planning perspective, to include actual or potential challenges/limitations associated with procuring these types of services (i.e. legal prohibitions, conflict of interest concerns, etc.)?4.  What labor categories and qualification requirements are most commonly associated with performing the task areas identified in the draft SOW? The Government is seeking feedback related to what firms practicing in this industry would view to be both the key and non-key labor positions and the minimum qualifications (i.e. education, years of experience, special certifications, etc.) for doing this type of work. 5.   Please discuss standard industry practices, and highlight any best practices associated with performing this type of work. 6.  Please discuss any issues the Contracting Officer should consider when developing the solicitation for this requirement (i.e. contract clauses, small business consideration, proposal preparation costs, etc.). Highlight any factors that would make competing for this contract desirable or undesirable for your firm. 7.   Please discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with a single award and/or a multiple award contract for these types of technical assistance services. What do you consider the more desirable option and why?  8.  Based on your firm?s experience, what procurement strategy represents the most effective approach when considering the cost, time, and resources required to manage a contact for these types of services efficiently.9.  What is the ideal contract type for procuring the type services supported under this requirement? Please discuss alternate contracting mechanisms to include Agency-specific contracts, Federal Supply Schedules, etc. 10.   Please discuss any additional comments or concerns. How to RespondPlease provide all/any responses to the Request for Information (RFI) no later than December 30, 2011 by 3:00p.m. EST in electronic or hardcopy format to Ms. Wanda Carrier and Nicole Pratt at:carrier.wanda@epa.gov  and pratt.nicole@epa.govorMs. Wanda CarrierUS EPAOffice of Acquisition ManagementMC-3805R1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20460

<DESC>****This amendment is to extend the registration deadline for the Industry Day from October 21, 2011 to October 26, 2011*****
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a critical need for an integrated, enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS).  In support of VA Transformation Initiative Health Care Efficiency, the RTLS solution shall support the objectives of focused clinical and administrative process efficiency and total asset visibility.  The mission of the RTLS Program is to provide multiple technologies to include Wi-Fi based location finding, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and a number of other location technologies, such as ultrasound and infrared when a Wi-Fi based solution is not feasible. These technologies will be used to track the location and flow of assets and people, as well as monitoring factors, such as temperature.  These capabilities can result in the design of more optimal processes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, reductions in staff hours spent searching for equipment, and the ability to maintain more accurate less expensive inventory levels within VA.  The purpose of the RTLS solution is to improve the efficiency of targeted business processes in its hospitals, clinics, offices and cemeteries to support the missions of Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and other VA entities.  
Industry Day: The purpose of this specific announcement is to inform interested firms that VA Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) - Austin has scheduled an Industry Day Conference on November 8, 2011 from 8:00 am to 2:30 pm (CT) in Austin, TX.  The Industry Day Conference will be held at the Wyndham Garden Hotel & Woodward Conference Center, located at 3401 South IH-35, Austin, TX 78745.  The purpose of the Industry Day Conference is to provide preliminary information on VA's anticipated technical requirements, business/contract considerations, acquisition approach and sub-contracting information.  The Industry Day Conference will also provide an opportunity for contractors to ask questions and for interested firms to network with each other. 
One-on-One Sessions: Following the Industry Day Conference, VA will host thirty-minute one-on-one meetings with contractors on November 8th and 9th.  The one-on-one sessions will be held at the South Park One building, located at 1701 Directors Boulevard, Suite 600, Floor 6.  VA is hosting one-on-one meetings with the intent of allowing each contractor the opportunity to express their technical, contractual and procedural concerns in regards to the RTLS program, requirements, and acquisition strategy.  The one-on-one meetings are limited to two representatives per firm, but four representatives per teaming arrangement or joint venture.  Participants are not permitted to bring any sort of marketing materials to the one-on-one meetings.  
Registration Requirements:  Companies of all sizes are invited, but you must be registered to attend.  A maximum of two representatives per company will be allowed, until the maximum seating capacity of 275 is reached.  Instructions for registration and Industry Day information (briefings, list of attendees and follow up Q&A) will be posted to the following website:  https://www.voa.va.gov.  Please continue to check the website periodically for updates and additional information.  The Industry Day and one-on-one contractor meetings registration deadline is October 26, 2011 by 2:00 pm (CT).  Please note, attendance/participation at the Industry Day Conference is encouraged, but is not a prerequisite for participation in any solicitation that may eventually result from the conference.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred for attending the Industry Day Conference.  
This announcement is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract(s).  No solicitations exist at this time.
All questions regarding the Industry Day Conference should be directed in writing via email to Sara Kessler at Sara.Kessler@va.gov.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br>Weapon System:  UH-60<br><br>1.  Contracting Agency - Army Contracting Command, Redstone, Attn: Aviation Logistics Directorate, CCAM-AL-M, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000.<br><br>2.  Description of Action - The nature of this contractual action will be a new Maintenance and Overhaul (M & O) for a ONE TIME BUY for a Quantity of 215. A Firm-Fixed Price type contract is contemplated utilizing Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF).<br><br>3.  Description of Supplies/Services - AMCOM Contracting Center proposes to acquire, on an other than full and open competitive basis the maintenance and overhaul of the item listed below:<br><br>     PRID:  UB672<br>     NOUN:  Valve, Assembly	<br>     QTY:    215    		         <br>     INPUT/ OUTPUT NSN:  1650-01-097-4914	<br>     INPUT/OUTPUT PN:  274010-1001	<br>     TOTAL ESTIMATED DOLLARS: $548,035.00 <br>     WEAPON SYSTEM: UH-60<br>	<br>The total estimated dollar value of the proposed procurement is $548,035.00.  This calculation is based on multiplying the historical unit price of $2,549.00 by the quantity of 215 each.  <br><br>4.  Authority Cited - Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c) (2), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency". <br><br>5.  Reason for Authority Cited - Reason for Authority Cited- The proposed acquisition requires the use of the cited statutory authority based on the following:<br><br>a.   Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) is not currently available to support a competitive solicitation.  The only known source of overhaul data for the Valve, Assembly Concentrator is Parker Hannifin Corporation (CAGE Code: 82106), 14300 Alton Parkway, Irvine, CA 92618.   There has not been any other source of overhaul for the Valve, Assembly.  The item was designed and manufactured to form, fit and function specification and therefore has been returned to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for overhaul and upgrade.   This item has not been designated as a Critical Safety Item (CSI). The Valve, Assembly is in critical demand.  The requirement was first known to exist as of 16 March 2011.  The average monthly demands for NSN: 1650-01-097-4914 is 77 with 30 backorders all of which are Priority 03.  The last order procured for the historical contract was on 23 June 2011.  The item is critical for mission.  The non-availability of the Valve, Assembly will result in the grounding of aircraft and will seriously degrade the mission in Theater.<br><br>   b.  A competing contractor would not be familiar with the total design parameters, specific repair parts requirement, test processes, etc., for the Valve, Assembly and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to take about 2.5  years to commence or complete an inspection and overhaul program, with no guarantee of success due to factors identified herein.  These shortfalls would prevent a competitive contractor from having on-line/available capability to satisfy specific program requirements (quality aspects, tooling/test equipment, engineering support) to meet the applicable delivery schedules and/or overhaul turnaround time frames.<br><br>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition - This requirement was published in Competition Advocates Shopping List (CASL) on March 2011 for NSN 1650-01-097-4914.   This requirement will appear in the next CASL update. Pursuant to FAR 5.202(a)(2), the proposed acquisition synopsis was waived.  <br><br>7.  Actions to Increase Competition -  There is no current DMWR for a competitive solicitation. Due to a critical shortage in the supply system, the item needs to go to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Parker Hannifin Corporation (82106).  Parker Hannifin is the only approved source at this time.  There is a future Valve, Assembly requirement (PRID CB672) in the planning stages for a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract that is sole source to Parker Hannifin. Any interested source will receive due consideration as required by law. The item was published in the Competition Advocates Shopping List (CASL) as of 31 March 2011.   <br><br>8.  Market Research - A market research as defined in FAR 10.001 was conducted by the Team Leader Bernida Childs within the last 12 months by contact with knowledgeable persons in Government and industry regarding the commercial nature of this requirement and standard industry practices in this area of supply/services, along with the review of Government and/or commercial databases for relevant information.  It has been determined that this requirement cannot be met by commercial items, commercial items with customary or minor modifications or non-developmental items, FAR Part 15 will be used.  Further, a reevaluation has been made in accordance with FAR 10.002(b), and the Government requirement cannot be modified in a way that will allow a commercial item to meet the need.  This item has been published in the Competition Advocates Shopping List (CASL) March 2011.  No new potential sources other than Parker Hannifin were identified.  As determined by the Market Research, the only approved source for this item is Parker Hannifin-Cage Code (82106).  <br><br>9.  Interested Sources - Pursuant to FAR 5.202(a)(2), the proposed acquisition synopsis was waived.  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.  All interested sources will receive due consideration as required by law.  Should a new source(s) become qualified via the Source Approval Request (SAR) process during the contract period of performance, the requirement for future orders will be reviewed.  If a new requirement can be validated, a new contract package will be processed and the new source (s) will be given an opportunity to compete for the award.<br><br><br>10.  Other Factors - Other factors affecting this effort are as follows:<br><br> Procurement History:<br>     Contract #                              Eff Date               Qty         Unit Price      Contractor Name<br>W58RGZ-07-D0136/0016      23 JUN  2011      255  EA    $2,549.00     Parker Hannifin<br>W58RGZ-07-D0136/0015      23 MAR 2011      273 EA    $2,485.50     Parker Hannifin<br>W58RGZ-07-D0136/0013      06 JUL 2010        100 EA    $2,485.50     Parker Hannifin<br><br>       <br>a.   Acquisition Data Availability:  Technical data is not currently available to support a full and open competitive solicitation. The Valve, Assembly is not classified as a CSI.  There is no Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) or drawings.  If a DMWR becomes available no future delivery orders will be awarded against this contract, the requirement will be competed.  The Government is not procuring the DMWR or the Technical Data package.<br><br> b.  Subcontracting Competition: A Subcontracting Plan is required per FAR 19.702 and FAR 19.704 for large businesses that exceed $650K.  According to FAR 19.704, the contractor must include FAR 52.219-8, entitled Utilization of Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Business Concerns in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities, and shall require all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities (except small businesses) to adopt a plan that complies with the requirements of the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small and Small Disadvantaged and Women-owned Small Business, HubZone Small Business Concerns Subcontracting Plan.  Parker Hannifin is a large business and will be required to comply with these requirements.  This acquisition will endorse the use of subcontracting to achieve the goals of utilizing small business within government contracts. The contractor must also include FAR 52.244-5, entitled Competition in Subcontracting. The clause is included below.  Parker Hannifin will be required to comply with these requirements.<br><br>The Contractor shall select subcontractors (including suppliers) on a competitive basis to the maximum practical extent consistent with the objectives and requirements of the contract.<br><br>If the Contractor is an approved mentor under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor-Prot g  Program (Pub. L. 101-510, section 831 as amended), the Contractor may award subcontractors under this contract on a noncompetitive basis to its prot g s. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
