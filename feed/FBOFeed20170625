The planned solicitation will utilize source selection procedures as outlined in FAR Part 15 that will include evaluation of both price and non-price factors.

The Department of the Navyâs (DoN) Mission Assurance Assessment (MAA) process was established in 2015 as a means to assess, identify, and mitigate risks to missions across the Service.
 Mission Assurance (MA) DoD Directive 3020.40 was published November 29, 2016 establishing policy and assigning responsibilities to meet the goals of synchronizing aspects of DoD security, protection, and risk-management programs that directly relate to mission execution.
The process involves the collection and evaluation of data concerning the criticality of facilities, utilities, industrial control systems, and supporting infrastructure based on mission impacts, probable threats and hazards, and degrees of vulnerability to determine the overall risk posture of the asset. It is a systematic, repeatable, rational, and a defendable process for identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing risks.
 While some risk will always be present, Risk Management seeks to achieve an acceptable level of risk in the execution of critical missions and functions.

NAVFAC Atlantic is searching the marketplace for companies that are capable of providing professional services which includes provision of all labor, management, supervision, tools, materials, and all equipment necessary to perform the services listed below.  
The Contractor shall be able provide services in accordance with DoN assessment program guides and benchmarks to include:

â¢	Perform Mission Analysis Site Visit. The visit includes the initial preparations and research required before conducting the MAA. The Mission Analysis site visit includes: coordinating and finalizing assessment preparations with the Installation point of contact (POC); validating the assessment intent and scope; reviewing and analyzing local assessment reports from enterprise Mission Assurance Assessment Tool (eMAAT), conducting mission analysis, reviewing pertinent All Hazard Threat Assessments (AHTA) site/asset research and confirming all POCs necessary for the on-site portion of the assessment.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
