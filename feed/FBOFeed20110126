THIS ACQUISTION IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE. THIS WILL BE A FIRM- FIXED PRICE CONTRACT WITH BASIC ONLY FOR THE FOLLOWING:<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </strong></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement is for a basic ONLY, Firm Fixed Price contract to develop manufacturing capabilities for improved GAU-18/A .<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">50 caliber machine gun barrels. This is a 100% small business set aside acquisition. </span>This will involve the manufacture of two (2) prototype barrels in accordance with Government-provided drawings and inspection to ensure compliance. The improved barrel design is expected to improve weapon system maintainability, reliability, supportability, and service life. The improved barrel is intended to be used on HH-60G and CV-22 aircraft. The current barrel is only qualified to endure a 5,000 round service life. The improved barrel is designed to be interchangeable with the current configuration with a longer service life. If performance characteristics are proven equal to or greater than the current barrel, the design will be continued to readily transfer heat from the breech, thus reducing the potential for "cook-offs" as well as increasing the burst length available to the gunners and flight engineers. <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide material and finish certification to show conformance to the material and coating requirements. The Contractor shall dimensionally inspect the manufactured barrels and provide a test report showing the values of the measured dimensions. The prototype barrels must meet all tolerances of the TDP for acceptance.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the repair and calibration of Agilent Power Sensors model number 84XX.  Agilent Technologies is the authorized source of repair/overhaul and owner of the proprietary data required.  The FAA contemplates awarding a Indefinite Delivery/ Requirements contract with one base and three one-year option periods to fulfill this requirement.
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Agilent Technologies, Englewood, CO in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
The determination to solicitation and negotiate with only one firm is necessitated and supported by the fact that Agilent Technologies owns the proprietary data rights associated with the equipment to be repaired under the contemplated contract. The design and proprietary data rights exclusively available to Agilent include all manufacturing specification data required for the repair of the 84XX Power Sensors.  
A market survey was posted on the FAA's Contract Opportunities web site on 11/17/2010 through 12/01/2010.  The results of this survey supported the determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm. 
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Aviation Management (OAM) has a requirement for safety training for DOE Aviation Managers and Aviation Safety Officers.
The Government intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU).  The period of performance for this award will be from February 17, 2011 through August 31, 2011.  
ERAU will provide certified instructors, textbooks and related materials.  In addition, ERAU will provide access to the High Altitude Normobaric Lab and the Full Motion Simulator. The course is designed to provide the participants with the working knowledge of the development and management of an effective safety program. While there are other sources for general aviation training curriculum, there is no single source that can provide flight safety, safety management systems, ground safety, physiology, and accident prevention/investigation and access to the High Altitude Normobaric Lab and Full Motion Simulator in one location.  Market research has revealed no other service with as detailed or thorough curriculum which includes the use of the High Altitude Normobaric Lab and Full Motion Simulator.  The Lab provides students with a unique experience in oxygen deprivation, which is a known contributing factor in aviation accidents and incidents.
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1],  as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  
Interested parties may submit capability statement and rationale by February 07, 2011 at 9:00am via e-mail to kyle.martel@hq.doe.gov.  The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.

<h1>Title: National Automotive Sampling System (NASS)</h1>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is charged with the responsibility of reducing the personal and property losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many sources of information are needed to permit researchers to adequately measure the characteristics of the highway safety environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA's National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) operates a system of crash research teams that provide:</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in; tab-stops: -1.0in">1.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detailed nationally representative statistics on motor vehicle crashes.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in; tab-stops: -1.0in">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A database for evaluation of standards and for countermeasures design.</p>
<p>In 1977, the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) was begun with contract awards to ten Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) research teams and two quality control Zone Center. The system grew to a complement of 50 PSUs and four Zone Center in 1981.</p>
<p>In 1986, the program was reviewed by NHTSA and other organizations to assess its usefulness, efficiency, and statistical precision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was determined that modifications were needed in case selection, data set definition, and PSU strata distribution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, in 1988, NASS was divided into two systems: Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and General Estimates System (GES).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CDS focused on the crashworthiness of passenger cars, light trucks, and vans involved in crashes and damaged enough to be towed. GES, on the other hand, collected limited data on other highway crashes in order to produce general estimates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From 1991 until 2010, CDS has included 24 PSUs located in 17 states with two quality control Zone Center.&nbsp; GES includes an additional 36 PSUs located in 9 additional states.&nbsp; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All CDS and GES PSUs are currently established and functioning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Specific Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Each PSU team collects certain information from traffic-police crash reports (PARs), which will be used to generate estimates of the nation's highway crash experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Police reports that include passenger vehicles that are towed due to the severity of the damage and have a high potential for major injury will generally be selected for full investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The investigation of each case includes interviewing drivers and occupants, inspecting scenes and vehicles, reviewing official medical reports, and reconstructing crash dynamics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Crashworthiness information will be entered into electronic data files and subject to review by quality control contractors and NHTSA.</p>
<p>The contractor enters information from each investigation into an electronic file.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Photographs are taken using digital cameras that allow the information to be readily entered into computers for storage and clinical review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After completion and quality review of all cases, NCSA prepares an annual analysis file for public use that includes case weighting factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All personal identifiers are removed from electronic files to protect the privacy of the individuals involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These NASS files, in conjunction with other data systems, provide the detailed and reliable information with which NHTSA and other motor vehicle research organizations can identify safety problems, monitor trends, assess proposed standards and countermeasures, and evaluate those already in effect.</p>
<p>Responsibility for operating the crash research teams, maintaining the quality of the field research data, and providing technical guidance for each PSU lies with the contractor-operated and maintained Zone Center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Zone Center serves as the resource center providing the PSUs with expert technical guidance in crash investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Zone Center closely monitors the performance of each PSU team in their zone as well as coordinating activities with the other zone center and NHTSA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are a management link between NHTSA and the crash research teams assuming responsibility for field data collection, management, and quality assurance while NHTSA assumes overall, policy management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Zone Center responsibility involves management of geographically distributed staff and requires experience in controlling field technical operations while interacting with NHTSA.</p>
<p>NHTSA plans to<span style="COLOR: black"> </span>procure crash research, quality control, and technical guidance by contractor-operated and maintained Zone Center #1 for the Crashworthiness Data System and General Estimates System of NASS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Contract Award:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA anticipates issuing a Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract will result in a total possible performance period of five (5) years.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">This solicitation is full and open competition.</strong></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Maximum ABOA square feet: 10,478</p>
<p>The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 5 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by 12/10/2011. The delineated area is:</p>
<p>NORTH: Lake Shore Dr. to E Lake Shore Dr. to East Industrial Blvd. to Loop 340 traveling east</p>

<DESC>Market Research for the Dry Support Bridge System<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this market research.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the research questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting, or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page, which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3.  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."<BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<BR><BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market research and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market research will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>     The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Dry Support Bridge (DSB).  Appendix 1 shows the current DSB system specifications and Appendix 2 illustrates pictures of a DSB bridge and a DSB Launcher Vehicle.<BR><BR>     The current DSB provides the United States Army with an enhanced tactical bridging capability that replaces existing bridges currently in service with U.S. ground forces including the Medium Girder Bridge (MGB).  The system is a highly mobile, Palletized Load System truck-mounted (Government provided), rapidly emplaced, MLC 80 track / 100 Wheel capable, modular bridging system capable of spanning gaps up to 40 meters (40 meters is the minimum threshold requirement, 48 meters is objective).  The Trilateral Design and Test code for Military Bridging and Gap-crossing Equipment dated January 2005 defines what MLC requirements are and what testing is required to meet those requirements.  See the website for copies of this document.  The Government is presently in the process of proving the gap spanning capability of the present system to 46 meters.  The DSB currently consists of a bridge and a launcher.  The bridge is capable of spanning a 40-meter or less gap without the use of intermediate supports, piers, span junctions or reinforcement sets.  The launcher is capable of launching a bridge at sites where the near and far banks are of differing heights and slopes.  The launcher can retrieve the bridge from either end.<BR><BR>     The DSB is organic to corps-level Multi-Role Bridge Companies (MRBCs).  These units are typically placed in direct support of division operations or retained in general support of the corps/theater operations.  MRBCs normally operate under the command and control of the corps engineer.  Each MRBC will have sufficient equipment and personnel assets to emplace four bridges simultaneously.  The threat environment that the DSB operates in will vary dependent upon its location in area of operations.  The primary threat will be from indirect fire systems including conventional munitions, scatter able mines, Improved Conventional Munitions (ICM), Terminally Guided Munitions (TGM), and surface-to-surface missiles.  The DSB will also be a potential target for direct fire from fixed and rotary wing aircraft that have been sent to destroy friendly Lines of Communication (LOCs), or are transiting the area and attack the DSB as a target of opportunity.  Secondary threats will include direct fire from threat forces operating in and around our rear area and equipped with demolitions, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and a variety of small arms to include man-portable Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs).  The DSB is also a potential target for chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.<BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<BR><BR><BR>1.  Number each response with the appropriate question number.<BR><BR>2.  You do not have to repeat the question in your response.<BR><BR>3.  If you cannot answer a question, please indicate "No Response."<BR><BR>4.  If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to question XXX."<BR><BR>5.  Include relevant sales media and product manuals.  If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions.  If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed.<BR><BR>6.  If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market research.<BR><BR>7.  Spell out any acronyms in their first instance.<BR><BR>8.  Clearly mark any proprietary information.  If applicable, the front page of your response package should state:  "Proprietary Information Contained."  Provide a release statement indicating that the proprietary information may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market research.<BR><BR><BR>Request for Information (RFI) ?

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being posted on GSA eBuy and via FedBizOpps, under the Franchise Authority of the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
AQD is conducting market research to locate potential sources, for an 8-inch rain gauge (non-recording) and a snow cutter adapter (consisting of gauge, stand, and measuring stick).  The 8-Inch Rain Gauge measures precipitation collected over an area 8-inches in diameter and about 5 feet high prior to field implacement.  The rainfall is funneled into a measuring tube having a diameter such that 1-inch of actual rainfall fills the measuring tube to a height of 10 inches.  The rain gauge is made of corrosion resistant steel, anodized aluminum, and a durable polycarbonate plastic.  The special measuring stick is calibrated so that attending personnel may record the actual rainfall directly from the scale reading.  An additional capability for measuring the water equivalence of fallen snow is provided by attaching the Snow Cutter Adapter and handle to the overflow container (funnel cap and measuring tube removed) which is made of corrosion resistant steel.  This Snow Cutter Adapter permits taking an 8-inch diameter frozen core sample that is subsequently melted for measurement of equivalent rainfall.
This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of providing the equipment described herein.   The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 334519, Weather tracking equipment manufacturing.
The capabilities and technical characteristics presented herein shall be considered as guidance only and for determining potential sources and acquisition methodology. Interested parties are invited to indicate their interests and capabilities by providing any information pertaining to experience on previous projects, and any other specific and pertinent information, as it pertains to this requirement, that would enhance the Governments consideration and determination regarding this acquisition.  Based on the results of this RFI, the Government will make a determination regarding the acquisition methodology for this procurement.  
RFI - Submission Requirements
The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made.  Respondents may be notified of the Government's acquisition method via an amendment to this notice or a new notice.

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p><br />The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the service stated herein. All small business concerns (SB, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an Identity and Access Management (IDAM) solution to be implemented, customized, integrated and configured for NIST to remain in compliance with regulations ad detailed below.</p>
<p>Currently, the core of NIST's IDAM solution consists of the NIST Locator and the Account Management System (AMS). They are linked to NIST's directory services through various third party applications custom developed import and export routines and manual processes. The NIST Locator and AMS system were designed over thirteen years ago and are based on legacy technology, systems and processes. They will be replaced by the new IDAM solution.</p>
<p><strong>NIST's IT Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>NIST has implemented the Windows Active Directory (Windows Server 2008R2) as the primary authentication and authorization infrastructure for IT systems. The Active Directory infrastructure also provides username and password authentication and authorization for applications utilizing LDAP.</p>
<p>The NIST Windows Active Directory infrastructure is synchronized with the NIST Locator and Account Management System through a NIST developed process utilizing Directory Wizards SimpleSync. Hitachi ID Password Manager is currently used to allow NIST users to change their Active Directory passwords and perform self-service recovery of forgotten passwords.</p>
<p><strong>NIST's IT System Environment</strong></p>
<p>NIST currently utilizes approximately 140 applications for general business and administrative functions. These applications may be in-house developed and operated systems, COTS applications operated in-house or applications hosted and operated externally to NIST. Approximately 10% of NIST's applications currently utilize the NIST Windows Active Directory for authentication and less than 5% are automatically provisioned through the current NIST IDAM solution. The remaining applications are provisioned and maintained independently often through distributed manual processes.</p>
<p>Applications may be operated out of either the Gaithersburg or Boulder facilities, some applications have a presence in both facilities. Most applications support users at both sites and some support non-NIST users located at other DoC facilities.</p>
<p><strong>NIST's Physical Access Control Environment</strong></p>
<p>NIST currently operates Physical Access Control systems (PACS) at both its Gaithersburg and Boulder campuses. These systems are currently disconnected from the logical environment and from each other. In addition, the Boulder PACS supports the entire Boulder campus including non-NIST occupants from other DoC Bureaus.</p>
<p><strong>New IDAM Solution Goals</strong></p>
<p>In order to implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and to comply with the November, 2010 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) passback (OMB M-10-15), which requires that all Federal agencies implement HSPD-12 and align their Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) activities with the Federal ICAM Roadmap, NIST is seeking a solution that will modernize its IDAM system and processes.</p>
<p>The purpose of this solution is to enable NIST to meet the Goals and Objectives outlined in the Federal ICAM Roadmap, to improve the efficiency of NIST and to support the diverse NIST IT environment. The solution shall perform the following: <br />&bull; Centralize the access request, approval, and management processes<br />&bull; Facilitate the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials for authentication, digital signatures, and encryption<br />&bull; Enable NIST to implement role-based user provisioning by linking users' access to assigned business roles<br />&bull; Allow for the access rights of managed users to be quickly audited across the NIST enterprise<br />&bull; Enable the provisioning of new users and accounts across the NIST enterprise in less than one hour<br />&bull; Enable the de-provisioning of users and accounts across the NIST enterprise in less than one hour. <br />&bull; Reduce the transmission and re-keying of (Personally Identifying Information) PII and identity data by interfacing / integrating with authoritative data sources and dependent systems.</p>
<p><strong>NIST's Authoritative Identity Data Source<br /><br /></strong>In preparation for the new IDAM solution NIST has implemented an authoritative identity data source, the Central People Table (CPT). The digital identity information of all NIST users is stored in a single Oracle database, the CPT. The CPT creates digital identities from NIST's two on-boarding applications-the NIST Associates Information System-Web (NAIS-Web), which tracks NIST Associates (contractors and guest researchers), and the NIST Human Resources Employee Arrival and Departure System (HRADS), which tracks NIST federal employees.</p>
<p>While most individuals hold a single "position" at NIST, those in the CPT have a one-to-many relationship with regard to positions. This allows the CPT to support the following NIST situations:<br />1. A NIST Associate has relationships (agreements) with multiple NIST organizations.<br />2. A person changes from a NIST Associate to an Employee (Hire) or from an Employee to Associate (Retirement)<br />3. A NIST Employee who fills several organizational positions usually has additional roles in an "Acting" capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Projected Scope</strong></p>
<p>NIST anticipates the award of an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract to establish a vehicle for NIST to upgrade its Identity, Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) infrastructure and processes to be compliant with HSPD-12 to comply with the November, 2010 OMB pass back (OMB M-10-15) and to align NIST's ICAM infrastructure with the Federal ICAM Roadmap.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates that tasks issued under this contract will include professional services and technologies required to transition from the current NIST IDAM state, which is based on disconnected manual processes and decentralized provisioning, authentication and authorization, to a centrally managed and maintained state which is aligned with the Federal ICAM Roadmap and leverages PIV cards as the primary authentication mechanism.</p>
<p>It is intended that the core component of the IDAM target implementation will be a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Identity and Access Management solution. It is intended that the IDAM system in the target state shall: <br />&bull; Be integrated with internal (NIST operated) and external (not-NIST operated) identity repositories, directories, systems, applications, Logical Access Control systems and Physical Access Control systems.<br />&bull; Centrally perform full lifecycle identity, credential and access management for all NIST sites for NIST systems (internal and external).<br />&bull; Enable PIV card authentication to systems.</p>
<p>Additional components and services may include any technologies (software or hardware) required to meet the detailed IDAM solution requirements, to integrate with NIST systems (internal and external) or to support the use of the PIV card.<br /><br />Professional support services may include, but may not be limited to: <br />&bull; Design of the solution<br />&bull; Installation and configuration of solution components<br />&bull; Integration of the solution with authoritative data sources<br />&bull; Integration of the solution with managed systems<br />&bull; Interface with external data sources and authentication providers<br />&bull; Operations and maintenance of the solution components<br />&bull; Help desk support<br />&bull; Continuity of operations support<br />&bull; Training of system users<br />&bull; System and security documentation<br />&bull; Customization and enhancement of solution components<br />&bull; Testing of solution, solution component, and integration.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates the award of an IDIQ contract for a base period of one year, followed by four, one-year option periods. The total estimated value of this contract vehicle is $5 million over the life of the contract, inclusive of cost of services and products/licenses.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services, with an SBA size standard of $25 million.</p>
<p><br />Sources that have the ability to provide this contracting support are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the NIST requirements as described in this notice. Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information within their narrative: information on the capabilities of their COTS IDAM solution, information on the relationship between the source and the manufacturer of the COTS IDAM solution if applicable, information regarding the breadth of services the source has performed on their COTS IDAM solution. In addition, those sources are requested to provide the following organization information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to NAICS code 541511 (size standard $25 million), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA schedule contracts under which your company can provide services in one or more of the applicable task areas, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work. All responses shall be emailed to keith.bubar@nist.gov no later than 5:00 pm EST February 14, 2011.</p>

 Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings using computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), per the A/E/C CADD Standard, and specifications produced in SPECSINTACT with Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) using the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS); Waterfront UNIFORMAT II classifications standard; contract bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; static and dynamic structural analyses using finite element computer modeling; two and three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including use of finite element models and time history acceleration data for linear and/or nonlinear analyses of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes.

A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment.
 This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations. Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, dams, levees, water control structures, instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, underwater cables, or any similar structure. All waterfront facility assessments, including underwater inspections will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers. For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC). That EIC shall dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports.
 The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report. The EIC shall ensure that all field inspection operations, including diving, are performed in accordance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements EM 385-1-1 (September 2008). US citizenship for all on-site personnel, including the requirement to pass a Federal Law Enforcement Agency Background Screening Process for access to Government sites is required.  

The synopsis that will result from this sources sought is anticipated to result in up to five (5) individual regional contracts being awarded to a single A&E firm for each region.  An A&E firm will not be excluded from any region based upon an award in any other single region.
  The A&E firm will distinguish which region(s) it desires to be considered for in their submittal package.  The anticipated regions are as follows: 1) Northeast, Southeast (including Key West), Great Lakes areas, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands. 2) Mid-Atlantic area, specifically Maryland, Washington D.C. & Virginia.  3) Southwest, Hawaii, & Gulf Coast areas. 4) Northwest area (including Alaska) and all Pacific U.S. Territories as defined by www.usa.gov including but not exclusive of American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, Johnston Atoll, Baker Island and the Northern Mariana Islands. 5) Oconus (foreign) areas excluding all U.S. Territories or other regions previously mentioned.
 For each contract awarded, the prime contractor is required to perform 50% of the work.

The A&E firm shall have the capacity to support the worst-case scenarios listed below simultaneously at any given time within the contract.  The Region 1 and 2 A&E firm shall maintain the ability to support 11 activity inspections following a major weather event while in the process of completing a facility inspection.  The Region 3 A&E firm shall maintain the ability to support 7 activity inspections following a major weather or geological event while in the process of completing a facility inspection.  The Region 4 A&E firm shall maintain the ability to support 9 activity inspections following a major weather or geological event while in the process of completing a facility inspection.

Please note that USTRANSCOM will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information.
<p>Introduction <br />The United States Transportation Command's (USTRANSCOM) designation as the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) is to oversee the overall effectiveness, efficiency, and alignment of DOD-wide distribution activities, including force projection, sustainment, and redeployment / retrograde operations. USTRANSCOM works in close cooperation with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and their Implementing Agencies (IAs), to enhance the overall flow of billing information, received from a number of logistic systems providing transportation data elements, to the billing of those data elements to the proper Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or Pseudo FMS cases. DSCA, through IAs, utilize Transportation Account Codes (TACs), which identify lines of accounting, which allow for the proper allocation of transportation charges to various FMS and PFMS cases. This usage identifies the billed amounts that USTRANSCOM Transportation Component Commands (TCCs) Air Mobility Command (AMC), Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Military Sealift Command (MSC) bill for transportation services rendered. Process improvements are needed to improve transportation expenditures stewardship through the issuance of TACs and other transportation related data elements, such as Transportation Control Numbers (TCNs), in support of transportation movements associated to FMS or PFMS cases.</p>
<p>Scope <br />The contractor shall provide USTRANSCOM with analysis of logistics information entering into TCC billing systems that support the billing of FMS and PFMS case freight moving through the Defense Transportation System. The specific tasks are:</p>
<p>Task Area 1: Contract Level and Task Order Management<br />Task Area 2: Analysis of Data<br />Task Area 3: Technical Recommendations</p>
<p>Specific Tasks</p>
<p>Task Area 1: Contract Level and Task Order Management</p>
<p>This task consists of functional activities relating to administration and management of this effort. The contractor shall provide program management of contractor personnel performing tasks in this task order. The contractor shall designate a principal point of contact for technical issues.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a centralized program management capability at the contractor site. This function shall encompass administrative, clerical, documentation and related functions that provide general support for the program.</p>

The Mission Installation and Contracting Command Center, Fort Bragg has a requirement to procure Surrogate Unmanned Aerial Support Services. Services include an L-3 Communications MX-15 sensor package with a standoff range capability to safely integrate into a target area with fighter and cargo aircraft (specifically, the sensor must acquire and identify contacts and targets from above 10K Feet MSL and out to slant ranges of 30K Feet). Incorporate a selectable Tactical Sensor Overlays system, which accurately replicates the Predator, Reaper, Litening Pod and AT-FLIR MTS tactical information embedded in the video stream. Therefore, the total Surrogate Unmanned Aerial Support hardware/software technical solution consists of a combined L-3/SCI package. By formal agreement between the two companies, neither can service clients with this package without the other team member. Full Motion Video training without this accurate simulation capability is considered negative training, thereby resulting in mission failure.  <BR><BR>The intended delivery date is February 2nd, 2011 Mission Planning Conference, and Flight Operations are scheduled for 11 through 15 February, 2011. <BR><BR>The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) HUBZone sole source contract to Systems Consultants., 185 North Main Street, Fallon, NV 89407. This firm is the sole developer/manufacturer /distributor of the product and no other certified HUBZone businesses can satisfy the Governments requirement.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time, January 29, 2011. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government for this as well as any future procurements. <BR><BR>For questions concerning this Notice of Intent, contact Scott Russell, contract specialist, via electronic mail at scott.russell4@us.army.mil . <BR>

PFA Scott double pass spray chamber used in tandem with PEEK cyclonic; sapphire injector, for the MML Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. *****Sole source determination is based on the need for The Inorganic Chemical Metrology Group (ICMG), in the Analytical Chemistry Division at NIST is participating in a highly visible international project that requires the absence of Silicon (Si) in the sample introduction system of a multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). Components of the sample introduction system must be made of special materials (i.e. sapphire, PFA, PEEK, boron nitride) that will prevent the introduction or leaching of Si. Failure to eliminate Si will result in high Si backgrounds, thereby increasing the limits of detection for Si, decreasing the overall Si sensitivity and limiting the accuracy of the results.
<p>AHF Analysentechnik is the only vendor that can provide the sample introduction system in a sapphire material that will replace the quartz, thereby providing a Si free torch. AHF Analysentechnik is also the only vendor that will provide the PFA double pass spray chamber that is configured to work in tandem with a PEEK cyclonic spray chamber. <br />Not eliminating Si from the sample introduction system of the MC-ICP-MS will result in severe analytical error and schedule risk to a highly visible international project and will adversely impact the NIST mission. Since AHF Analysentechnik is the only vendor to provide the needed critical components for the sample introduction system, it is requested that the contract be awarded to AHF Analysentechnik.<br />. <br />1) 876-408 Shield Protection (BN) for Si free torch 0 , <br />2) 2) 876-10 Saphira torch for Thermo Neptune<br />3) 876-05 Saphire outer tube <br />4) 857-131 Spray chamber made of PFA (element) <br />5) 876-08 Saphira inner tube, <br />6) 855-59 Sapphire injector, i.d. 1.9mm for Thermo Neptune <br /><br />The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Sea-Bird Electronics for the purchase of Sea-Bird Electronics replacement and back-up equipment for the Seabird SBE 911 Plus Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) Units currently in place at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL.
<p><br />A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on January 5, 2011 and closed on January 14,2011. No responses were received.</p>
<p>The following replacement and back-up equipment is required:<br />&bull; SBE 4C CTD Conductivity Sensors are the primary sensors of the CTD used to measure conductivity<br />&bull; SBE 3Plus CTD Temperature Sensors used to measure temperature with a demonstrated drift of less than 0.001 &deg;C during a six-month screening period and a time response of be 0.065 &plusmn; 0.010 seconds.<br />&bull; CTD Dissolved Oxygen Sensors used to measure oxygen<br />&bull; 24-Position Carousel Electronic/Release, hub assembly and bail assembly, which is a release latch assembly and integrated electronics module for a 24-bottle oceanographic carousel water sampler<br />&bull; Deck Unit for 911 Plus CTD supplies DC power to the CTD, decodes the serial data stream, and passes the data to a computer</p>
<p>Sea-Bird Electronics is the only known vendor to provide replacement and back-up equipment that is compatible with the Seabird SBE 911 Plus CTD. To replace existing equipment with a brand other than Sea-Bird Electronics is not cost effective.</p>
<p>The Seabird SBE911 Plus (CTD) is one of the primary tools used by AOML scientists for determining essential physical properties of sea water. It gives scientists a precise and comprehensive charting of the distribution and variation of water temperature, salinity and density that helps understand how the ocean affect life. The shipboard CTD is made up of a set of small sensors attached to a large metal rosette wheel. The rosette is lowered on a cable down to the seafloor, and scientists observe the water properties in real time via a conducting cable connecting the CTD to a deck unit that interfaces to a computer.</p>

<DESC>The Regional Contracting Office Hawaii at Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) intends to award a sole source bridge contract to NANA Services, LLC for Full Food Service Support at Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) Mess Halls.  The purpose of this action is to provide continuity of support to the MCBH Mess Halls while resolving the protest issues.  This contract will be the second contract to bridge the gap between the existing (bridge) contract soon to expire, and a new competitively awarded follow-on contract which has been delayed due to several GAO protests.  The period of performance for this requirement is 3 month from 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011.  It is not in the best interest of the Government to compete this short-term requirement.
  The solicitation preparation and evaluation would result in a duplication of effort and incidental costs on the part of Government personnel.  

This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOI), proposals or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals, or quotations received in response to this notice. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, and should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities to provide services sought including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the government is available.
  The government will consider all EOIs received prior to 4 February 2011 before 1600 Hawaii Standard Time on that date.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  EOIs sent via the US Postal Service should be mailed to Commanding Officer, Regional Contracting Office (Attn:  Vivian Fukumitsu), Box 63063, Bldg 209, MCBH Kaneohe Bay, HI 96863-3063.  EOIs sent via Federal Express or hand carried must be delivered to Regional Contracting Office Hawaii, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Bldg 209, Kaneohe, HI 96863 during weekdays, excluding federal holidays, between the hours of 6:30am and 4:00pm.
  This purchase will be under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Note 22.  Point of contact for this procurement is Vivian Fukumitsu, 808-257-3528.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for proposals.

The National Cemetery Administration, Philadelphia, PA, intends to modify an existing contract (VA786-P-0971) for Grounds Maintenance Services currently performed by Native Contractors, Inc. (CAGE 1JHE3) to add the following Landscaping Services at its Beverly National Cemetery location (916 Bridgeboro Road, Beverly, NJ  08010) for all supervision, labor, equipment, tools, and materials necessary to provide trimming, edging and debris / trash removal services. 

This determination is being made under FAR 6.302-1, as only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy this requirement, because of the need to closely coordinate trimming, edging, and debris removal services with regularly scheduled grounds maintenance activities. It is also anticipated that there will be some cost savings to the government by removing duplications of managerial and labor efforts.

Firms who wish to challenge this sole source determination must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your ability to provide the requested services as described at an economical price by the close of business February 2, 2011.

All responses received will be evaluated, and a determination by the government to compete, or not compete, the proposed procurement action is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

It is emphasized that all information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement and will not be construed as a formal proposal.

The government will not reimburse any costs connected with providing the requested capability information.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

Description:   Satellite telemetry (radio) tags and attached hardware to mount the tags to polar bear ears, Chukchi Sea
Background: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) operates a research project to collect the information necessary to make management decisions for polar bears in the Chukchi and Bering seas, as required by an international treaty between the U.S. and Russia.  The requested satellite telemetry tags provide critical data on polar bear movements, distribution, and habitat use. 
Statement of Work (SOW) / Specifications
Deliverables:	Fifteen (15) units of glue-on satellite radio tags and fifteen (15) units of ear-mounted satellite radio tags with attached associated mounting hardware, as described below in the salient characteristics section.
Delivery FOB Destination with receipt by March 15, 2011
U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceMarine Mammals Management, Polar Bears1011 E. Tudor Rd., MS341Anchorage, AK 99503ATTN: Eric V. Regehr, Ph.D.

Salient characteristics: 
"	General specifications:o	PTT transmitter required to send locations via system Argos. o	A VHF beacon is not desired because it adds to the size of the tags.o	Wet-dry sensor required.o	Transmission schedule of the tags must be flexible and user-programmable. For example, we will specify                  a one-day duty cycle for the first month of tag deployment, and a three-day duty cycle for subsequent                  months.o	Tags must be encased in robust packaging (e.g., epoxy) to withstand stresses of animal behavior and                  the marine environment, which means waterproof, salt proof, and unbreakable. The antennae must be                  sufficiently durable to withstand icing.

"	Specifications for glue-on tags:o	Battery life must be sufficient for at least 25,000 transmissions to the Argos system.o	Must have a low profile and a shape factor appropriate for glue-on application, with the long axis of the                 tag parallel to the spinal column of the animal. Maximum dimensions are approximately 80x20x11 mm                (length, width, height).o	Antenna should be in line with the long axis of the tag, such that it lies relatively flat along the back of the                 animal.o	Maximum weight is approximately 100 g.
"	Specifications for ear-mounted tags:o	Battery life must be sufficient for at least 50,000 transmissions to the Argos system.o	Must have a small size and a compact shape factor appropriate for mounting on a polar bear ear.                 Maximum dimensions are approximately 41x30x18 mm (length, width, height).o	Maximum weight is approximately 33 g.
"	Specifications for the attachment hardware to mount the ear tags to the ears of polar bears:o	Attachment hardware base should consist of a platform bonded to the radio tag, made of stainless steel                 or another appropriate material.  Footprint area of the platform must not exceed the size of the base of                 the tag.  o	A post with approximate diameter 0.5 cm and washer system are required to attach the tag through a                hole in the bear's ear.  Platform and washer surfaces that contact the bear must be rubberized to prevent                 cold damage to tissue.  o	Attachment hardware should be as light as possible and must not exceed a weight of 25 g.  o	Attachment hardware must have undergone field trials to evaluate its ability to withstand stressed of the                Arctic environment. (Provide sufficient data to verify field trials with your quote)

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) Cyber Security Division's (CSD) announce a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Fiscal Year 2011 to improve the security in both Federal networks and the larger Internet.
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks ideas and proposals for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in 14 Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) related to CSD. The total estimated value of this acquisition is $40 million.</p>
<p>Cyber attacks are increasing in frequency and impact. Even though these attacks have not yet had a significant impact on our Nation's critical infrastructures, they have demonstrated that extensive vulnerabilities exist in information systems and networks, with the potential for serious damage. The effects of a successful cyber attack might include: serious consequences for major economic and industrial sectors, threats to infrastructure elements such as electric power, and disruption of the response and communications capabilities of first responders.</p>
<p>The DHS S&amp;T mission is to conduct, for homeland security purposes, research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and timely transition of cyber security capabilities to operational units within DHS, as well as local, state, Federal and operational end users in critical infrastructure. Cyber security is defined in broad terms to encompass the usual attributes of security, as well as reliability, availability, and survivability in the face of adversary attack and accidental fault, while preserving privacy.</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and system prototype demonstration in an operational environment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>A critical area of focus for DHS is the development and deployment of technologies to protect the nation's cyber infrastructure, including the Internet and other critical infrastructures that depend on computer systems for their mission.</p>
<p>The goals of the DHS Cyber Security Division (CSD) are:</p>
<p>&bull; To perform research and development (R&amp;D) aimed at improving the security of existing deployed technologies, and to ensure the security of new emerging systems;</p>
<p>&bull; To develop new and enhanced technologies for the detection of, prevention of, and response to cyber attacks on the nation's critical information infrastructure; and</p>
<p>&bull; To assist the transfer of these technologies into the national infrastructure as a matter of urgency.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI conducts programming in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region. The FS has recently produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region. The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.</p>
<p>The FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) program supports the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan. The FTI engages the Government of Pakistan's FS and Political Agents as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs. The FS and its representative Agency structures constitute the key interlocutors within the GOP for this program. The FTI effort requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc. Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole. In addition, the program will undertake media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT IS TO ALLOW A TRIPLE AXLE TRAILER. ALL OTHER SPECIFICATIONS REMAIN THE SAME.
The following is answers to vendor questions submitted. REMINDER ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING VIA FAX OR EMAIL - NO PHONE CALLS. EMAIL: Andrea_Brew@nps.gov or FAX: 307.344.2079
It is not physically possible to fit a 9kw solar array onto the 28' trailer.  That is approximately 750sqft of solar modules.  Can part of the array be installed on pole mounts next to where the trailer will be parked?  
NO WITH NEWER TECHNOLOGY USING 225 WATT PANELS THE ARRAY WILL FIT ON THE TRAILER SIZE REQUESTED
Your scope of work states an enclosed trailer.  With the large amount of solar panels hanging off of or mounted onto an enclosed trailer's roof, there WILL be wind loading issues due to the center of gravity being so lop sided with this configuration. Can the trailer be a flat deck trailer with the batteries and electronics housed inside of vented enclosures?
NO. NO DEVIATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED
The Power requirements are stated in 3 different ways in your RFQ. Could you please clarify this for me? I have bolded and underlined the three different sentences that say 3 different things. 
We need to know the 'Peak Load' requirement, and the 'continuous' power requirements on the inverters in order to properly configure the system for you.  We can built to either the 14kw or the 28kw peak/surge requirement.  Concurrent/simultaneous load is different from Peak/Surge load which are used interchangeably in the industry.  It is basically simply doubling the Inverters required which will result in an increased cost.  Please let me know which number your folks are looking for and we will quote accordingly.
AN ENERGY AUDIT LOAD INFORMATION WAS ACQUIRED FROM ONE DAY OF DATA COLLECTION AND WAS USED AS A REFERENCE AND DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR OUR NEED FOR A STRONGER SYSTEM FOR THE SAYS WE HAVE HIGHER ELECTRICAL LOAD AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE ELECTRIC LOAD BEING ADDED. THEREFORE WE LISTED THE INVERTERS TO BE A MINIMUM OF 14,000 WATTS COMBINED POWER FOR THE 120/240 VOLT AC SYSTEM. ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE TO COMBINE 4 EACH OF 4.4KW INVERTERS TO EQUAL 17.6 KW COMBINED TOTAL WITH A 35.2 KW SURGE. WE WOULD ACCEPT A LARGER THAN MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.
Some industrial solar battery manufacturers have a 75% to 80% depth of discharge rating, to accomplish 3 days autonomy can this % DOD be used if the battery is capable and approved by the battery manufacturer? You state that the Batteries provide 3 days autonomy; however, you also require that the Batteries have at least 4,800 amp hours.  With these calculations 4,800 amp hours capacity based on your demand of 21kw per day, this give you over 6 days of autonomy. As a result you are doubling the actual number of Batteries required for the 3 days of autonomy not to mention doubling the weight and cost.  Could you please clarify for us?
AGAIN, ENERGY AUDIT LOAD INFORMATION WAS ACQUIRED FROM ONE DAY OF DATA COLLECTION AND WAS USED AS A REFERENCE AND DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR OUR NEED FOR A STRONGER SYSTEM. THE 3 DAY AUTONOMY WAS MEANT AS A MINIMUM OF 3 DAYS, BUT DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL ELECTRICAL LOAD THE BATTERIES MIGHT ACTUALLY LAST 6 DAYS. WE DECIDED ON THE 4,800 AMP HOURS TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL ELECTRICAL LOAD AND FUTURE GROWTH.
To cover 9,000 Watts you would need around 66 solar panels which is not functionally plausible for a 28' trailer.  Please clarify this requirement.
AGAIN THE ENERGY AUDIT LOAD WAS MEANT AS A REFERENCE (21KW) BUT FOR THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PV ARRAY WE WANT 9,000 WATTS. WITH NEWER TECHNOLOGY USING  225 WATT PANELS THE ARRAY WILL FIT ON THE TRAILER SIZE REQUESTED.
Is the 28' length the maximum length allowed?  
YES  - DUE TO THE LOCATION AND ROAD CONDITIONS THE REQUEST MUST STAY WITH THE 28' LENGTH
If so does the tow tongue count into the total length or just the actual dimension of the trailer box itself? 
ACTUAL DIMENSIONS                                Does the floor have to be constructed of treated wood or can it be constructed of something more durable like rolled steel, etc? THE REQUEST STATES TREATED WOOD. NO DEVIATION WILL BE ACCEPTEDIs the 8.5 foot width the minimum width allowed as most trailers as well as vehicles are not that wide. Most we see are between 5'6" and 7' wide which are more that adequate to handle these load requirements. 
THE REQUEST STATES 8.5 WIDTH - WE ARE AMENDING THE REQUEST TO ALLOW UP TO A TRIPLE AXLE.
You state that the trailer have aluminum skin with a frame constructed of 2x6 or 4x8 tube. Can it also be constructed with heavy duty durable rolled steel in conjunction with aluminum and/or stainless steel? 
NO. THE REQUEST STATES THE MATERIALS WE WANT FOR FRAME CONSTRUCTION, NO DEVIATION WILL BE ACCEPTED.
Could you please clarify as to the need for a side door being 48' x 72'? The request states we want a side door 48' x 72'. 
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT A SMALLER DOOR. NO DEVIATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.
If the solar trailer is fully functional and meets or exceeds all of your other requirements then can the side door(s) be a different size if the design of such trailer is such that it would fully provide you with total access to all the trailer components as necessary with the proper designed doors in locations as necessary? 
THE DOOR MUST MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS AS REQUESTED. NO DEVIATION WILL BE ACCEPETED.
Could you please clarify as to the need/purpose of having a sliding rear ramp?  
THE REQUEST STATES A SLIDING REAR RAMP IS REQUIRED.
 If the solar trailer is fully functional and meets or exceeds all of your other requirements then is the sliding rear ramp necessary if the design of such trailer is such that it would fully provide you with total access to all the trailer components as necessary with the proper designed doors in locations as necessary? 
YES THE REQUIREMENT STATES A STANDARD SLIDING RER RAMP IS REQUIRED. NO DEVIATION WILL BE ACCEPTED. You state that "assembly materials and hardware for the Solar Array be aluminum or stainless steel."  Can it also be constructed with heavy duty durable rolled steel in conjunction with aluminum and/or stainless steel? 
THE REQUEST STATES ALUMINUM OR STAINLESS STEEL NO DEVIATION WILL BE ACCEPTED. You state to locate the power harness to site generator connections, etc on left side of trailer (street side).  Can these connections be located at the rear of the trailer so long as all electrical specifications are meet or exceeded?
 NO DEVIATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED

BACKGROUNDThe Bechler Ranger (Soldier) Station was established in 1910 in a remote outpost that was occupied by the US Army to help curb the growing threat of illegal hunting in the park. The Ranger Station is located in the most remote location within the lower 48 United States. Today the National Park Service (NPS) operates the facility from May until November (due to the severity of the winters). It functions as a public contact area for hikers, backpackers, fishermen and tour groups. Approximately six rangers reside at the facility during the summer season.
SCOPE OF WORK Currently, the NPS facilities depend on a 20 KW propane generator to supply all electrical requirements. The generator operates 24 hours a day from early May until late October. The generator powers a large well pump for supplying potable water for employees and visitors as well as providing water for the fire suppression system. Additionally, all employee residences and a public contact station are powered by the generator. In the past, the park examined the feasibility of installing a photovoltaic system that would reduce the dependency of the propane generator. Due to the severe winter months, it was realized that the batteries would have to be removed from the area every fall and re-installed every spring.  The permanently installed solar panels would be subjected to very heavy snow loads (up to 10ft) and would also have to be disconnected every fall. As a result, it was determined that a permanent photovoltaic system would not be practical.
Through technological advances, various companies now produce state-of-art photovoltaic systems that are portable. The solar panels are mounted on the roof of an enclosed trailer that houses the battery bank; all switch gear, DC/AC inverter and a high efficiency backup propane generator. This application would be ideal for the Bechler Ranger Station, as the trailer would be moved out of the area during the winter months and used in different areas of the park where winters are not as severe. It is anticipated that the trailer unit will provide over 80% renewable energy for the Bechler complex. This will result in an estimated reduction of over 21 metric tons of green house gases, annually.
Over 5,000 visitors enjoy the Bechler area every summer; hence the park will have a tremendous opportunity to inform/educate visitors on the environmental attributes of producing electricity from the sun. It is envisioned that this project will serve as a model for other remote sites within Yellowstone NP and other national parks within the United States. Lastly, the trailer will be used during the winter months in a variety of venues throughout the Yellowstone region that will result in high visibility benefits. This will include special park headquarters events, traveling to various high schools and universities within Montana, Idaho and Wyoming and regional gateway community functions.

<DESC>AHRQ Quality Indicators Program 2011-2016
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified businesses including 8(a), small disadvantaged, HUBZone, veteran-owned small business and service disabled veteran-owned small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 which have the capability to provide ongoing technical support services to the Support for AHRQ Quality Indicator (QI) Program 2011-2016.</p>
<p>AHRQ is the lead Federal agency charged with improving the quality, safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care. AHRQ has developed an array of health care decision making and research tools that can be used by various audiences such as program managers, purchasers, consumers, researchers, government agencies and others. One of these tools, the AHRQ Quality Indicators (QIs), is widely used for national, state-level and hospital-level public reporting and tracking, highlighting potential quality concerns, and identifying areas that need further study and investigation by a number of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The AHRQ QIs are a set of approximately 100 quality measures, based on hospital discharge data, organized into four modules-Prevention, Inpatient, Patient Safety, and Pediatrics, each of which measures quality associated with the delivery of care that occurs in either an outpatient or an inpatient setting. The AHRQ QIs are based upon a few guiding principles which make them unique:</p>
<p>&bull;The QIs were developed using readily available administrative data;</p>
<p>The QIs use a transparent methodology;</p>
<p>The QIs are risk adjusted and use a readily available, familiar methodology;</p>
<p>The QIs are constantly refined based on user input;</p>
<p>The QIs are updated and maintained by a trusted source; and</p>
<p>The QIs documentation and program software reside in the public domain.</p>
<p><strong>The AHRQ QI modules are:<br /></strong>Prevention Quality Indictors (PQIs) or ambulatory care sensitive conditions that identify adult hospital admissions that evidence suggests could have been avoided, at least in part, through high-quality outpatient care. <br />Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQIs) reflect quality of care for adults inside hospitals and include: Inpatient mortality for medical conditions; inpatient mortality for surgical procedures; utilization of procedures for which there are questions of overuse, underuse, or misuse; and volume of procedures for which there is evidence that a higher volume of procedures maybe associated with lower mortality.</p>
<p>Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) also reflect quality of care for adults inside hospitals, but focus on potentially avoidable complications and iatrogenic events. <br />Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) both reflect quality of care for children below the age of 18 and neonates inside hospitals and identify potentially avoidable hospitalizations among children. <br />The AHRQ QI are currently being used in hospital level public reporting programs in more than 20 states, will be included on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare website in 2011, have been included in the methodology used for U.S. News World Reports ranking of the top 100 hospitals in the U.S., included in the National Healthcare Quality Report, and are used by numerous hospitals and hospital systems in their quality improvement programs. The AHRQ QIs are also anticipated to help facilitate some activities called for under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The AHRQ QI project is unique in that it provides publicly available measure specifications, technical documentation and software tools that calculate the AHRQ QI measures. This software (provided in both SAS and Windows) legally resides in the public domain and is available as a free download from the AHRQ QI website. It allows users to calculate QI measure results based on their own administrative data set using a standard desktop computer.<br />Detailed descriptions of the project can be found at: www.qualityindicators.ahrq.hhs.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:<br /></strong>AHRQ desires to ensure the continuity, timeliness, and accuracy of the core tasks of the AHRQ Quality Indicator program through 2016.

This is NOT a Request for Proposal. TACOM Integrated Logistics Support Center (ILSC) and TACOM Contracting Center are requesting this information for planning purposes only.  All interested parties are advised that the Government will not pay for, or provide any reimbursement whatsoever for the information provided. No contract or other instrument will be provided as a result of this request for information and no reimbursement will be provided for any information provided. Therefore, any costs associated with the provided Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the expense of the concern submitting the information. <BR><BR>The overall objective of this potential program is to develop FMTV engine repair capability at Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and support the future Life Cycle Management for the Caterpillar Models 3116, 3126 and C7 engines using the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) concept. The expected period of performance is 5 years. The expected production rate is 53 engines per month. All work will be performed at RRAD located in Texarkana, TX. The Contractor shall develop a Public-Private Partnership with RRAD in accordance with 10 USC 2474. The Contractor and RRAD shall perform a Pre-Shop Analysis (PSA) on these engines to determine level of repair required to return them to Condition Code "A" (CCA). The engines will be triaged to a rebuild process or a limited repair process according to their condition based on the outcome of the initial PSA. The engines will come in containers. The level of repair may be National Maintenance Work Requirement (NMWR) or commercial practices.  Only Caterpillar parts are required to support this effort. The Contractor shall provide the technical expertise, life cycle data management support, supply chain management and data management control as required to support the process, product, data management and reporting requirements under the SOW. RRAD will provide the touch labor. The Contractor is responsible for part support and the final product and quality.

The Contractor/RRAD shall collect and analyze engine data elements off the ECM, update the ECM, and report trends/results back to TACOM in the Contractor's format.<BR> <BR>Unique Identification (UID) marking is required. Condition Code H Engines inducted and normally declared scrap will be utilized as core assets. A PSA will determine disposition of engine processing to include continued processing and returned back to the customer as Condition Code A or determined uneconomical to repair.  The Contractor shall provide a report of engines and major components that would normally be declared scrap or scrapped engines in RRAD's format. This shall include the engine/major components serial number and National Stock Number, the reason for scrap, the scrap rate per engine model and the overall program engine scrap rate. This effort will also include a core reimbursement for all washed out blocks and cam shafts. There is a short block requirement to provide cams and blocks to bring the engine back to a serviceable condition and reduce the scrap rate. The final product will be fully dressed operational/tested rebuilt engine.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that would apply to this potential requirement is 333618.

******************************************************************The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide FAA management and executive leadership training instructional support services.  The market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA 8(a) certified small businesses.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine the FAA's acquisition strategy for the prospective contract requirement.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA intends to establish an instructional services contract by August 2012.

The Small Business size standard for NAICS 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training) is $7.0 Million dollars.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  When a Request for Proposal is issued the FAA may decide to issue the Screening Information Request for full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.

<DESC>All additional Questions MUST be submitted, in writing, no later than 27 JAN 2011 or the Government may not be able to provide an answer prior to the closing due date and time.<BR><BR>Questions and Answers (cont.) submitted from 21 JAN 2011 through 26 JAN 2011 (Offeror questions are posted EXACTLY as written unless the brackets: [] are used to clarify or protect identifiable information):<BR><BR><BR>Question 9) [Of] the changes from Jan 20th, Revision 1 of the Pre-Solicitation Notice, item c: Security Requirements, it says that the prime contractor shall be a US Firm. Does that mean for the complete project or just for security parts? We are a German General Contractor and would like to participate on this construction project. Is this possible??	<BR><BR>Answer 9) The prime contractor MUST  be a US Owned Firm for the construction contract. <BR><BR><BR>Question 10) Please confirm that the Prime Contractor can be a Joint Venture or Consortium of two US firms, in which only one firm has Secret Facilities Clearance.	<BR><BR>Answer 10) A Joint Venture is one entity so both firms are treated as the Prime, meaning both need the Secret FCL.<BR><BR><BR>Quesiton 11) Since the CIC Project will be performed outside the US, please confirm that a direct subcontractor to the Prime Contractor can act as the provider of the Secret Facilities Clearance to the Prime Contractor's key personnel having Secret Clearance.	<BR><BR>Answer 11)  No, the subcontractor cannot be the provider of the "secret" facilities clearance. The Prime must be the holder of this clearance.<BR><BR><BR>Question 12) The answers to questions and the extension of submission date of the CIC pre-qualification have been published only a few minutes before the due submission time (20 January 2011, 15:00 CET). Since at that time we have already submitted our pre-qualification response, and since there were significant changes to the pre-qualification, please advise how we should consider the submitted material.	<BR><BR>Answer 12) An additional time extension of 2 weeks was provided with the answers to those questions at the time of posting (20 JAN 2011); an adequate amount of time has been provided for contractors to submit revised submissions. Contractor information that has already been submitted will stand unchanged unless the contractor re-submits revised information OR advises the Government that is wishes to revoke it's earlier submission.<BR><BR><BR>Question 13) Please grant an extension of two weeks to the pre-qualification submission date, i.e. 18 February 2011.	<BR><BR>Answer 13) No, and as answered in #12.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>PLEASE NOTE: No further extensions are available for this pre-solicitation notice or the due date for submission of prequalification information, and will not be granted if requested.<BR>

Whether the contractor covers all six Technical Area Requirements with in-house expertise or through other business arrangements such as teaming or subcontracts, it will remain the responsibility of the prime contractor to provide the required support.  Accordingly, all six Technical Area Requirements must be addressed in your proposal and the resultant award will include all six Technical Area Requirements.  <BR>

It is the vendor's responsibility to confirm through AFSI/FedBizOpps for additional postings detailing or identifying firm dates.  <BR><BR>b.	BIDDER'S LIBRARY ACCESS:  Requirements for access are detailed in Section L of  Draft Solicitation W91260-11-R-0003.  Interested vendors are encouraged to review access instructions and forward request as soon as possible.  If vendors do not have an individual with an AKO account and/or CAC, please contact theresa.coffenberry@us.army.mil and jen.d.baker@us.army.mil as soon as possible so additional coordination can be processed.  <BR><BR>c.	ONE-ON-ONE DISCUSSIONS:  This is a reminder that the Government will be hosting One-on-One sessions on 7 February 2011.  Each session will be limited to 15 minutes.  Each vendor will be authorized up to five attendees.  Interested vendors should contact Ms. Theresa Coffenberry and Ms. Jennifer Baker via electronic mail: theresa.coffenberry@us.army.mil and jen.d.baker@us.army.mil.  Each request should provide the following information:<BR><BR>Vendor Name:<BR>Address:<BR>CCR Address:  If different, than above<BR>Cage Code:<BR>Individual Names:<BR>Individual Phone Numbers:<BR>Individual E-mail Addresses: <BR><BR>On-on-One requests shall be received by the Government no later than close of business on Monday, 31 January 2011.  <BR><BR>d.	QUESTION/COMMENTS:  Vendor input is due no later than 1400 Mountain Time, Thursday, 10 February 2011.  Request each vendor provide one (1) consolidated list of questions/comments.  Vendors are reminded that, although, the Government will receive inquiries up to issuance of the final solicitation, any questions/comments regarding the Draft Solicitation should be received no later than the required 10 February 2011 date.  If additional inquiries are made after this date the Government will not consider for review and possible incorporation into the final solicitation.  Vendor questions, to include Government responses, will be placed in the bidder's library with restricted access.  <BR><BR>e.	ADDITIONAL SITE VISIT:  The Government previously hosted two site visits:  1) Wideband Satellite Operations Center (located on Ft. Derrick, Maryland) and 2) Regional SATCOM Support Center (located in Tampa, Florida).  As stated in the above milestones the Government will be hosting an additional site visit to the new WSOCS site in Wahiawa, Hawaii (located on Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS)).  Camp Roberts requirements have been recently relocated to the Wahiawa site which has a newly constructed WSOC facility.  This facility is similar to future WSOCS facilities being planned over course of the contract.  Attendance in this site visit is voluntary.  Failure to attend any of the site visits does not constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.   Due to space limitations interested vendors will be allowed space for two individuals to attend.  If interested request you forward e-mail to theresa.coffenberry@us.army.mil and jen.d.baker@us.army.mil no later than 14 February 2011.<BR><BR>2.	Vendors are reminded any information published, to date, and/or questions/comments received by industry are for market research purposes only.  A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.    Any information provided by industry to the Government is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. Information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in revising the "Draft" Solicitation and Potential Acquisition Strategy.   Vendors are reminded that the Acquisition Strategy has not been approved; and therefore, could change before final solicitation issuance.  If/when final solicitation is issued it is the vendor's responsibility to ensure understanding of the terms and conditions as identified in final solicitation.  <BR><BR>3.	Additional information, as it becomes available will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement and will be available for viewing on Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) https://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review these sites frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  <BR><BR>
