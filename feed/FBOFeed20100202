<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Rome has a requirement to provide life cycle software development and engineering support for the CCCIIS program. The CCCIIS program includes, but not limited to, the following messaging systems; Message Information Services and Tools for the IC (MISTIC), Communications Support Processor (CSP), the Tactical Communications Support Processor (TCSP), and Infrastructure Operations Tools Access (IOTA). An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. We anticipate approximately $49,900,000 to be a sufficient ordering amount for the 60 month period of performance. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511.
<p>The scope of this effort is to provide systems engineering analysis, technical enhancements, system sustainment, system installation, and on-site engineering support for the U.S. Intelligence Community including the Air Force, Defense Intelligence Agency, Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units, and other members of U.S. Intelligence Community. Technical activities will include, but not be limited to: analytical studies, system feasibility studies, requirements definition/analysis, design, development, implementation, demonstration, systems engineering, integration, installation, site support, configuration management, quality control, training, integration/interoperability/security testing, security engineering, engineering support, and the generation of technical documentation detailing the above activities. In the course of performance, the Contractor will interface with various agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community sites worldwide via short term visits and electronic means. On-site support is currently required in Colorado Springs, CO, Hampton VA, Robins AFB, Marietta GA, and AFRL Rome Research Site to provide analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation of DODIIS Information Technology (IT) and to U.S. C4ISR Community systems and activities.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not warranted.</p>
<p>The successful contractor may receive and/or generate technical data subject to export control in the performance of the contract. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. The successful offeror must have a completed and approved DD Form 2345 prior to award. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.</p>
<p>A technical library relating to the subject area of this acquisition is available for review by potential offerors at Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEBB, Bldg. 3, Rome, NY 13441-4505. Appointments for access may be made by contacting Mark A. Esposito, 315-330-3930, e-mail Mark.Esposito at least forty-eight hours in advance. The library contains technical data subject to export control. Prior to review, potential offerors must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, "Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement", along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library, to ATTN Mark A. Esposito, Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEBB, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome, NY 13441-4505.</p>
<p>Foreign disclosure review has determined that foreign participation will be excluded at the prime contractor level.</p>
<p>Under the current contract, the work requires a TOP SECRET facility clearance and approximately 50 personnel with TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. Based on current estimates, approximately 30 personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance at time of award. An additional 20 cleared personnel is estimated to be required within the first 45 - 60 days.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Kelly L. Conniff, (315) 330-4073, Kelly.Conniff@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Karen S. Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754.

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NNA05AC42C with Integrated Science Solutions,Inc. on a sole source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One ResponsibleSource.  The objective is to extend the performance period for a potential eight monthperiod, consisting of a five month base period, and three one-month options.  Theprinciple purpose of this contract is to provide environmental support to NASA AmesResearch Center.  The current contractor provides the following mission critical supportservices under the environmental contract:  Environmental Compliance, PollutionPrevention and Sustainability, Wildlife and Habitat Conservation and NEPA Compliance,Site Investigation and Restoration, and Environmental Management Systems.  The purpose ofthis contract extension is to assure continuing compliance with numerous Federal, Stateand Local environmental laws, regulations, and policies in carrying out NASA/ARC'smission critical programs, projects, and activities.This extension will begin March 4, 2010 and end on August 3, 2010 for the base period;and end on November 3, 2010 if all three one month options are exercised.  The extensionis in the Government's best interest to provide ongoing environmental services until anew contract is awarded.  The current contractor, Integrated Science Solutions, Inc. isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARC's needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension.	Additionally, competing the requirement for a period ofup to an eight month term would not be possible given the end date of the currentcontract and the requirement for uninterrupted service.  Awarding the potential eightmonth contract to another contractor at the same time the recompete is in process wouldresult in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to berecovered through competition of the extension as well as unacceptable delays infulfilling ARC's critical requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30 p.m. local timeon February 16, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the provision of an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Collection Management Tool (ICMT) and related services for ISAF in Afghanistan.  The procurement will provide ICMT capability to support the management of Priority Intelligence Requirements; the planning, tasking, and monitoring of ISR collection and exploitation systems; the management and dissemination of intelligence documents; and the reaction to emerging collection requirements in a timely manner.

NC3A was authorized to use the Alliance Operations and Missions (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure.  The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be the lowest price technically compliant bid that is in accordance with the evaluation criteria. 

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference of the IFB is IFB-CO-12937-OPL. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work.  No partial bidding will be allowed.

Bidders must have an overall personnel security and facility clearance of NATO SECRET at the time of the IFB release in order to be eligible to receive the bidding documents and to submit a bid.  Due to the classification, bidders will be required to submit any bid response material through the U.S. Mission to NATO. 

The successful contractor will be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET, and only companies maintaining the appropriate facility clearance will be eligible to bid.  In addition, contractor personnel visiting or working on operational sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of at least NATO SECRET.

The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for the contract.

The Summary of Requirements may be found on pp. 10-11 of the following document:

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for an ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 17 February 2010

2. Anticipated date that the NC3A will forward the IFB to those on the Bidders List: March 2010

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: April 2010

4. Anticipated contract award date: June 2010

<DESC>Introduction and Background 

The contractor shall apply DeltaDust to burrows in designated prairie dog colonies on the Wall Ranger District of Buffalo Gap National Grassland and Badlands National Park for sylvatic plague abatement.  For each fiscal year, dusting can start as early as 1 April but all designated colonies must be completed by 30 September of the same fiscal year.  

Sylvatic plague was discovered on the Wall Ranger District in May 2008.  A large-scale dusting effort resulted between four different agencies in an attempt to protect habitat for the endangered black-footed ferret.  A total of 11,239 acres consisting of 543,560 burrows were dusted in 2008 over a period of three-and-half months.  In 2009, a combination of federal agencies and a private contractor dusted basically the same acres.  Plague is still active in the area and nearly the same acreage is planned for dusting in 2010. 

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall dust all burrows in designated prairie dog colonies.  Designation of colonies and subsequent acres to be dusted will vary on a yearly basis depending on funding and plague movement in the area.  A minimum of 500 acres will be designated in 2010 but could be adjusted as high as 20,000 acres depending on funding.  Subsequent years could be as high as 20,000 acres or as low as zero.  Most, if not all work will be conducted in the Conata and Scenic Basins on the Wall Ranger District and select colonies in Badlands National Park (Exhibit 1).   

The Contractor shall be licensed, registered and certified by the State of South Dakota, to provide pest control services in all the categories specified in this contract.  All Contractor employees who apply pesticides in any form shall be certified by the South Dakota Department of Agriculture in the appropriate category of service (Category G and 9).

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) Novel Biometric Signatures
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-10-02

<ARCHDATE>03022011
<CONTACT>Michael C. King, Email DNI-IARPA-RFI-10-02@ugov.gov
<DESC><strong>Synopsis</strong><br /><br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.<br /><br /><strong>Background and Scope</strong><br /><br />Since 9/11, the Intelligence Community's (IC) need for reliable biometric recognition performance has expanded beyond today's access control and verification applications that operate within tightly controlled conditions. The IARPA Smart Collection Office is seeking innovative ideas and concepts for the advancement of standoff biometrics technologies. IARPA's objective is to maintain a high degree of recognition accuracy (i.e. level of confidence<br />associated with the match/non-match of biometric signatures derived from two distinct observations), while pushing the range of acquisition as far as possible and requiring minimal cooperation from the subject. The emphasis is on classifying and recognizing unique human phenomenology (i.e. anatomical, physiological, and/or behavioral), or novel biometric signatures, that may by acquired from significantly greater ranges than from today's commercially available biometrics technology. This could include new or unproven&nbsp; signatures, whose efficacy and potential are little understood, and which are not considered top tier biometric modalities. <br /><br />More specifically, IARPA is interested in novel biometric signatures that can be captured by non-contact methods; i.e., not involving immediate proximity to a sensor. Specific&nbsp; signatures that currently require close sensor proximity may be considered only if a reasonable technology development path exists to permit the acquisition of such signatures from significant ranges (i.e. in excess of 50 meters). While this RFI is not interested in addressing the fusion of biometric<br />signatures, scientific approaches must include any techniques necessary to ensure signatures of interest are being derived from human sources. Also not of interest are techniques or technologies that exploit face, ocular (including iris), and voice or speech biometric modalities. <br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather input for an IARPA Workshop on Novel Biometric Signatures anticipated to take place on 31 March 2010 in the Washington, DC Metro Area. The workshop objective is to understand the potential feasibility and limitations of novel biometric signatures. Participants will be selected primarily from respondents to this RFI. Workshop participation will be limited to US citizens and permanent US residents. This workshop seeks<br />to accomplish the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Identify novel biometric signatures-the phenomenology corresponding to human processes/structures based on anatomical, physiological, and/or behavioral characteristics that may exhibit distinct features and are likely observable from significant ranges; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Explore non-traditional sensing methods-to include all aspects of transduction (i.e. emissive or modulation-based), propagation, and acquisition (may include techniques for distortion correction) of the signature(s) of interest from significant ranges.<br /><br />While the practical aspects of operations and deployment are not considerations at this stage, IARPA also seeks to understand the potential size, weight, and power characteristics of technologies being presented. It is expected that research efforts into these novel biometric signatures will ultimately provide new capabilities in human recognition that heretofore have not been feasible.<br /><br /><strong>Workshop Format</strong><br /><br />It is anticipated that this two-day workshop will bring together researchers from diverse disciplines, including the biological sciences, computer science, physics, and engineering. As such, it presents unique opportunities for cross-disciplinary dialogue that address the unique challenges of potential signatures. The format will offer an opportunity for participants to educate both IARPA and one another in their disciplines and research, as well as provide a forum to facilitate the cross pollination of ideas.<br /><br /><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents</strong><br /><br />IARPA invites respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and a rough estimated cost of the proposed approach. This<br />announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kit, or other materials are needed.<br /><br /><strong>Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.</strong> Responses have the following formatting requirements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The document should be formatted in 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPARFI-10-02 (This page is not included in the white paper page count);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary (This page is not included in&nbsp;the white paper page count);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas summary. (This page is not included in the white paper page count);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Five page white paper that includes the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Brief scientific discussion of specific signature(s), technology, or technique<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Predicted accuracy and stability of the phenomenology (i.e. signature)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Method(s) of acquisition<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Predicted acquisition time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Predicted minimum/maximum range of subject in proximity to sensor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Mechanisms to potentially increase range between subject and sensor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Prior relevant experience<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. A list of relevant citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations; citations are not included in the white paper page count)<br /><br /><strong>Submission Instructions to Respondents</strong><br /><br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time, College Park, MD, on 4 March 2010. All submissions must be electronically submitted to DNI-IARPA-RFI-10-02@ugov.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI should be submitted to DNI-IARPARFI-10-02@ugov.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephonic inquirieswill be accepted. Requests for meetings, briefings, demonstrations, etc., will not be considered.<br /><br /><strong>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES</strong><br /><br />This is an RFI issued solely for information and possible new program planning purposes, and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to extend a workshop invitation to a respondent solely on the basis of white paper submission.<br /><br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in their response.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on the responses received. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal. </span>Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by<br />IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by&nbsp; appropriate non-disclosure requirements.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.  This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704. 

Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The Physics Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO, requires a Time Scale System to modernize the current NIST Time Scale. The NIST Time Scale System is one of the most crucial resources for NIST, the nation, and for international coordination of time and frequency. 

NIST is the official U.S. source for time and frequency for civilian applications, and for international coordination of time and frequency. Precise time and frequency, referenced to NIST standards through the NIST Time Scale, underpins critical national technologies such as navigation, telecommunications, electric power distribution, electronic financial transactions, and a wide range of other technologies crucial for the economy, safety, and security. 

The NIST Time Scale is the core of measurements and research that underpin NISTs most heavily used services (including more than 3 billion synchronization activities over the Internet every day).  NIST participation in international time coordination which underpins many key technologies, and a wide range of NIST research on future atomic clocks and other types of future measurement capabilities. 

The Time Scale System is comprised of two systems: The Frequency Standards Measurement System and the Precision Time Distribution and Time Transfer System.

The statement of work is available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/hpod.  Interested contractors shall prepare a technical submission of no more than 10 pages (excluding resumes) which consists of the following three sections:  1) resumes of no more than two pages for the persons who you plan to assign to this project; 2) a narrative discussion that demonstrates your company?s understanding of, and technical capability to perform, the tasks contained in the statement of work illustrated with examples of previous successful projects in diversity recruiting support;  3) past performance references for three projects completed in the past five years that have similar scope, size and complexity as the project described in the referenced statement of work.  For each reference, please include the contract number, name of the project, description of the work performed, dollar amount, and name, title, current address, e-mail address, and telephone number of the contracting officer and the project officer.    In addition, please submit a labor-hour quote, which includes a total cost for each task in addition to a total cost for the entire project.  Also include proposed amounts for any anticipated other direct costs, including travel. Please note that award of a fixed-rate contract is contemplated and your total proposed cost will be the ceiling price for the resultant order.  The following evaluation criteria will apply. 1.  Proposed personnel will be evaluated on their knowledge of/experience in the federal recruiting process, development of recruiting plans, diversity recruiting tools and strategies, and development of performance metrics;   2.  Technical Capability will be evaluated based upon your company?s demonstrated knowledge, understanding, and experience with Federal human resources policy, development, implementation and assessment of diversity-focused recruiting plans; strategic planning; and development of recruiting materials.    3.

Award will be made to the contractor whose quotation affords the best value to the Government, technical, price and other factors considered. All technical evaluation factors are considered to be of equal importance and when combined are more important than price.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This acquisition will be a cost reimbursement R&D effort in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the Development, Preparation, cGMP Manufacturing and Testing of Antiplaque Chewing Gum Containing Antimicrobial Peptides for Phase I Clinical Trial for the U.S. Army Dental and Trauma Research Detachment (USADRTD), a detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).  The USADRTD has developed several candidate antimicrobial peptides that could be used for controlling plaque-associated oral infection, including dental caries.  The USADTRD is particularly interested in developing antimicrobial systems that could be incorporated into the military field ration, specifically into chewing gum.  Their use of this novel antiplaque chewing gum could significantly reduce the incidence of dental emergencies among deployed forces by controlling plaque formation, allowing sustained operations in extreme environments while maintaining mission capabilties.  In pursuit of this objective, the USADTRD is interested in the development and manufacturing of small scale current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) antiplaque chewing gum containing USADTRDs antimicrobial peptide (KSL-W) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which exhibit broad-range bactericidal activities, to be used in the oral cavity for improving the oral health of the deployed soldiers.  In conjunction with this effort, the USADTRD is interested in determing the stability of this prototype cGMP antiplaque chewing gum and the release kinetics of the bacteria-fighting agent from the gum formulations.<BR><BR>The specific objective of the requirement is to manufacture, according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 210 and 211, a Phase I Lot of Antiplaque Chewing Gum (APCG) with associated internal Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) reviews, for use in nonclinical animal and human clinical studies, as defined and summarized in the Quality System Plan (provided in the Request for Proposal) which identifies the roles and responsibilities of the US Army and Manufacturer.<BR><BR>Contract Requirements:  All work to be accomplished under this Contract shall be in accordance with the requirements of the contract and in strict accordance with the contract technical specifications.  <BR><BR>One contract shall be awarded on a Best Value basis to the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the government given its responsiveness to all aspects and requirements of the solicitation and considering cost and other non-cost-related factors.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325411.  RFP No. W81XWH-10-R-0029 will be available for downloading at the Army Single Face to Industry website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi on or about 17 February 2010, with proposals due on or about 19 March 2010.

<DESC>This is an update to the synopsis previously posted under M6700409R0011.  There is currently an approved acquisition strategy for this requirement, however we are still awaiting approval of the determination to award a single IDIQ contract (Section 843 D&F).  We anticipate releasing the solicitation 15 days after receiving this approval under this solicitation number (M6700410R0002).  I will post an update here when we receive the approval, so the solicitation timeline is now sliding day for day (i.e. today you can anticipate a solicitation around 18 Nov, tomorrow you should anticipate 19 Nov, etc. until I post the update stating that a single award is approved and start the 15 day clock).We will not hold an industry day, and instead will allow a period for written questions after the solicitation is released.  We anticipate the solicitation remaining open for approximately 90 days, and do not intend to entertain requests for additional extensions of the solicitation period.  The source selection will be based on best-value trade-offs.  The task-order contract, consisting of a total of five years of ordering period (including base and all options) will contain fixed-unit prices for the standard level of work (remanufacture, overhaul or repair) specified for each item, with an Over & Above CLIN for O&A work.  Unit prices will be redeterminable prior to each option period based on the applicable contract language, and/or Service Contract Act redeterminations.  The Government will not require the use of the Government-owned Commercial Asset Visibility II (CAVII) information system and instead will allow contractors to propose their own method of providing the required asset visibility.  The Service Contract Act will apply, but as we cannot anticipate where all subcontractors will be located the solicitation will not contain the applicable wage determinations.  Wage determinations will be added via solicitation amendment based on proposed subcontractor locations, however we expect that offerors will use www.wdol.gov to locate the wage determinations that are likely to be included and price accordingly in advance of the subject amendment.Please see the attachment for draft language regarding price redetermination and asset visibility requirements.  Feel free to submit questions or comments regarding this draft language, as any improvements we make now can still be incorporated into the initial solicitation.
This Synopsis is not a request for competitive price proposals. Offerors are responsible for checking the FedBizOpps website for any update(s) to this Notice. The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offerors inability to access the document(s) posted at the referenced website. To obtain automatic notifications of updates to this solicitation, you must log into FedBizOpps.gov and add the solicitation to your Watch List. If you would like to list your firm so others can see you are an interested vendor, you must click the "Add Me to Interested Vendors" button in the listing for this solicitation on FedBizOpps.gov.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) requests information to develop practical and sustainable models for meeting the primary objectives of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) in an information environment dominated by digital technologies. This work should explore what is possible within the current legislative framework for the FDLP as well as suggest specific changes to the law where the existing language is found to be inhibiting the practical exercise of the FDLP's purpose and goals.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The desire for an informed and impartial consultant to perform this study has broad support across the depository library community and reflects the goals of a recommendation made by the Depository Library Council after its Spring 2009 meeting. The development of practical and sustainable models for the FDLP in the digital era is a necessary next step in building further consensus among all stakeholders and ensuring the public has systematic and secure access to Federal Government information in the 21st century and beyond.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<span style="COLOR: black">Information received by GPO on this effort will be used to help determine the future state of the FDLP and may be used to plan for and/or seek legislative or administrative changes to the Program. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) is continuing the strategic planning process for the future of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Identified goals are to determine a sustainable model or models for delivering FDLP collections and services to the American public in the online Federal Government information environment.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</span></span></strong>The use of digital information technologies by FDLP libraries; the general public; and Federal agencies, to publish and provide citizen-centric, dynamic, and participatory e-government services, presents opportunities for unprecedented access to Government information. Fundamental aspects of ensuring that the American public has current and future access to Federal information, however, are hindered by the existing structure of the FDLP, based primarily on a 19th century model of print production and distribution. To be relevant in the electronic era, the FDLP must develop other working models to fulfill its programmatic mission and outline the roles that each of the depository partners play in making Government information widely and publicly accessible.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;GPO and various library communities have devoted considerable attention to the study and discussion of these important issues since the early 1990s. From GPO's 1996 Report to Congress to the recently published Ithaka Report, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Documents for a Digital Democracy</em>: <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">A Model for the Federal Depository Library Program in the 21st Century</em>, substantial work has been done by a variety of stakeholders to address many key issues surrounding public access to Government information in the digital age. There is broad consensus in the depository library community on the values and principles of the FDLP.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">For more than 140 years, the GPO has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government's information, this Program involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Libraries designated as Federal depositories maintain these information products as part of their existing collections and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided through the FDLP.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">vision</strong> of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide Government information when and where it is needed in order to create an informed citizenry and an improved quality of life.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">mission</strong> of the Federal Depository Library Program is to provide for no-fee ready and permanent public access to Federal Government information, now and for future generations.</p>

Some of these contracts and orders have not contained the most favorable terms and conditions or discounts.  In an effort to consolidate and streamline the contracts and ensure greater asset management, it is proposed to create a Microsoft Consulting Services contract.  <BR><BR><BR>SCOPE:  MCS will primarily focus on providing IT architecture and planning services; Technical Adoption consulting; complex and non-complex architecture for new and emerging Microsoft technologies; solution and infrastructure design, development and implementation of new, existing, emerging and non-emerging technologies; hands-on scenario based training of new, existing, emerging and non-emerging Microsoft technologies; application development of emerging and non-emerging Microsoft technologies; Enterprise Desktop deployment; specialized industry solutions, and core infrastructure optimization.  MCS could be utilized in the following areas (including but not limited to):  assisting in developing, integrating and deploying information technology designs and solutions related to the AGM; developing technically sound solutions that reduce the workload of the DOIMs and information technology personnel on the ground for both workstations, server builds, the imaging processes, workstation and server hardening processes, configuration management, application compatibility, patch management, and data migration processes; creating an Information Assurance (IA) Portal for both internal and external information sharing via a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) implementation; implementing and deploying an Active Directory (AD); and deploying information technology architectures, designs, and solutions related to support of other related Army enterprise infrastructure (AEI) activities.<BR><BR>QUESTIONS:  The government is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in the development of a Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) RFP:<BR><BR>1.  Is your company able to provide all requirements listed in the attached PWS?  If not, please identify the requirements that you are able to provide (with reference to the applicable section(s) of the PWS).<BR><BR>a.  Of the requirements that you can provide, will the services actually be <BR>performed by Microsoft (MS) employees?<BR><BR>b.  Are MS employees the only ones actually capable of performing the required <BR>services?  If so, what is the reason? <BR><BR>c.  Would it be accurate to state that you essentially function as a gatekeeper providing access to MCS, but do not have capability to provide the services yourself?  If not, identify which of the services (with reference to the applicable section(s) of the PWS), you can provide without MS employees?<BR><BR>d.  Must you negotiate a subcontract work order with MS separately for each task <BR>order, and, if so, would that impact you ability to provide timely service?<BR><BR><BR>2.  Does your company have Microsoft Certification credentials to perform these services?<BR><BR><BR>3.  There are gamuts of MS products within DoD with Operating Systems ranging from NT to Windows 7.  Is your company able to support services for all of the DoD MS products and Operating Systems?<BR><BR><BR>4.  What experience does your company have with MS technologies and what specific MS products has your company previously supported?<BR><BR><BR>5.	 How long has your company performed services in relation to MCS?<BR><BR><BR>6.	What other Government organization(s) has your company previously provided support to?<BR><BR><BR>7.  Is your company able to provide MCS support to DoD Agencies in CONUS and OCONUS locations?<BR><BR><BR>8.  Does your company have personnel with the capability to obtain the required <BR>security clearances of at least Secret and up to Top Secret, Specialized Compartmentalized Information for performance under a contract? <BR><BR>9.

Under the arrangement between MS and resellers, can resellers propose to provide the Microsoft Consulting services to the Government at a discount from the commercial list price of MS? <BR><BR><BR>      11.  How would you suggest measuring your performance to determine if that <BR>      performance meets the requirements of the contract while supporting future <BR>      competition?<BR><BR><BR>12.  What training and education could be included in a Microsoft Consulting Contract?  For example, Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) training, and educational support? <BR><BR><BR>13.  What other services and added value solutions do you propose?  For example, <BR>support to other software products on Microsoft platforms.  <BR><BR><BR>Your ideas and input in answering the above information will greatly assist us in creating the most appropriate and relevant RFP for Microsoft Consulting Services.<BR><BR><BR>The information below is for industry only from NCRCC<BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed twenty (20) pages, and supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed fifteen (15) slides.

<DESC>Director, Joint Ground Robotics Enterprise (JGRE) is seeking sourcesinterested in providing a low cost, alternative power source for unmanned ground vehicles for the Joint Services. In todays military, unmanned systems are highly desired by combatant commanders for the versatility and persistence.  By performing tasks such as surveillance; signal intelligence; precision target designation; improvised explosive device detection and defeat; tunnel exploration and mapping; mine detection and clearing; and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear reconnaissance, unmanned systems have made key contributions to the Global War on Terror.  With this continued employment of increasingly sophisticated forces of unmanned systems, an ever-increasing demand for power and energy densities continues to hinder development.  New and innovative alternative and regenerative power sources are sought to deliver a large energy density capability to small ground mobile platforms.  Improvements in cost, size, weight and capacity are desired.  Development technologies will advance power and energy source units and integrate advanced batteries into robotics ground vehicles and unmanned systems. A working knowledge of ground robotics and unmanned systems is required. Responses should include suggestions on design approaches with regards to:
1) Reducing total unit cost; 
2) Vehicle integration strategy, to reduce cost in all program areas including ideas for vehicle-related integration solutions utilizing current/approved onboard power systems; 
3) Reducing size (less than 6x12X30) and weight (less than 25 lbs.);
4) Increasing capacity/peak performance (greater than 75 amp/hours, 20amp/500 watt peak, 100 watt nominal); 
5) Technology solutions with readiness levels that can support production and fielding within the next 3-5 years.
Responses are to include the following:
1) Name of corporate point of contact, telephone number, full mailing address, e-mail address, CAGE Code, NAICS identifier and any other pertinent information
2) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to development and production of military and/or commercial energy/power source/battery technology
3) Whether your company's interest in the alternative power technology is as a system developer prime contractor, a subcontractor or a vendor of components or services

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Objective</p>

<p>To perform this function, various methods are used to evaluate questions including: cognitive interviewing, focus groups, and usability testing. Respondents are recruited to participate in hour or 1 &frac12; hour interview/focus group and are given remuneration. Interviews and focus groups are audio or video recorded. On-line and internal applications are used to conduct evaluations. They include: Q-Video, Q-Notes, Q-Notes Plus and Q-Bank.</p>
<p>Q-Video is a digitized video/audio application that captures, stores, and indexes the video and audio of a cognitive interview at the questionnaire level in a digitized database for the purpose of searching individual questions and conducting analysis. All Q-Video tasks are done manually.</p>
<p>Q-Notes are a software program that supports the structured collection and analysis of cognitive interview data. Hence, it serves as an audit trail tracing each finding to the original source.</p>

<p>Q-Bank (a product of an interagency collaboration and hosted by NCHS), is a database consisting of evaluated questions from Federal surveys and links each question to the scientific report that evaluated the survey question. Questions are searchable by survey title, question topic (e.g. income, demographic, chronic health conditions), information type (e.g. objective characteristics, behavioral reports, attitudes), response category (e.g. yes/no, open-ended, quantity), response error (e.g. problems with terms, recall problems). In addition, users can search for keywords within individual questions. Q-Bank is intended to help users of survey data interpret the survey questions on which the data are based and understand the potential errors that might be associated with these questions. A steering committee of representatives from various agencies directs the future and development of the database.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)/Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) (hereinafter referred to as the Government) is currently conducting market research to determine the availability of potential vendors to provide Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC) and Green House Gas (GHG) measurements on the NOAA WP-3D Aircraft during the CalNex 2010 Field Study. Specialized equipment is needed to collect air samples in flight during the field study and expert analysts with domain knowledge are needed to perform the required analysis of the data. This is not a solicitation; it is only a Request for Information (RFI). The Government anticipates award of a four and one-half month base period followed by two, one year option periods. The base period shall begin April 15, 2010.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>NOAA is conducting a major field study in California from May 1, 2010 through June 23, 2010 in collaboration with several U.S. federal agencies, California state agencies, and university researchers. During this study a NOAA WP-3D research aircraft will be used to perform chemical and meteorological measurements throughout the study region. To meet the study objectives this aircraft will be equipped with a comprehensive array of chemical and meteorological sensors. These instruments have been specifically designed or modified for use on NOAA's WP-3D research aircraft.</p>
<p>For previous similar field studies NOAA has procured the use of the University of Miami's sample collection system. This system meets the required technical specifications and is flight certified to fly on the NOAA WP-3D Aircraft. The University of Miami also has the technical expertise to analyze the data.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: NOAA requires a Contractor with a flight-ready instrument capable of collecting 72 Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) samples per flight using remotely-actuated, electropolished, stainless steel canisters during the CalNex 2010 Field Study May 1, 2010 - June 23, 2010. The Target Species for CalNex 2010 are listed in Attachment I. The system shall be capable of autonomous as well as remotely triggered on-demand sampling and be certified for operation in the unpressurized AMPS-ESI wing pod on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft. The Contractor will be required to provide preliminary services leading up to the study (instrument calibration, integration into the aircraft payload. etc.) and sample analysis during and after the study. The Contractor shall have the facilities and staff necessary to provide rapid turnaround (within 7 days) for the samples collected including: shipping to and from a central laboratory, sample analysis, and canister cleaning. Data analysis expertise in the interpretation of VOC and GHG data, includes an understanding of the roles of these compounds in the complex chemistry of ozone and fine particle formation. This analysis system must be capable of quantifying atmospheric VOC and GHG concentrations down to mixing ratios of 10 pptv (parts per trillion by volume). The samples collected must be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with seven days of collection and individual VOC and GHG species quantified. The Contractor will be required to present results at user's meeting and at a Government selected conference and prepare reports for publication.</p>
<p>The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars. The purpose of this request for information is to determine if there are sources capable of satisfying the Government's requirements and to determine whether these services are provided to the commercial market. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested sources are encouraged to provide information regarding their capabilities to perform these measurements. Qualification statements should at least indicate past performance, ability of their instrumentation to perform the required measurements, whether the offered collection system has been certified for operation in the unpressurized AMPS-ESI wing pod on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft and the dimensions and weight of the collection system. In addition, responders should demonstrate that they have the data analysis expertise in the interpretation of VOC data, including an understanding of the role of these compounds in the complex chemistry of ozone and fine particle formation.</p>
<p>NOAA will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments. Qualification Statements will be treated separately from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals. NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. NOAA as noted above is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the attached requirements. Written comments or e-mails shall be received no later than 2:00 P.M. Mountain Time, February 9, 2010. Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Susan Labovitz, MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305. Submittals may also be sent by e-mail to Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov. Telephone responses are not acceptable. This notice is not a Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bids or Request for Quotes. It is a RFI and is part of the Government's market research process. <br />&emsp;</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT
GENERAL:  The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior (DOI), is conducting a sources sought for the work described below. This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. The amount of interest will determine the possibility of a set-aside or full and open competition. This is not a request for quote or proposal, or invitation for bid. 
NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Richard F. Harris at Richard_Harris@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-6646 by 4 PM on Tuesday, February 9, 2010.  Clearly identify your firm's size status and provide your DUNS number in your response.  
The NAICS code for this work is 541990 with a small business size of $7.0M.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Follow-on phase requirement for climate change scenario planning and training. A contractor would need to have specific experience in climate change scenario planning and not just business or other types of scenario planning, to participate in this solicitation.  
A report from the prototype phase contract would be provided to each vendor interested in participating.  Unless you're the contractor who did the initial prototype phase, the report would not be sufficient to do the follow-on phase without doing some research activities, process development, analysis, toolkit development, etc. 
It is the intent of the NPS to award a sole source contract to the contractor that conducted the initial prototype phase, unless there exists other companies who can be competitive while conducting and paying for the prototype phase research activities and its other aspects noted herein.   
This is the follow-on phase of an initial climate change scenario planning work that was conducted between Jan - May 2009.  This phase will consist of four (4) training workshops, which will be developed and conducted with scientists, managers, and planners to build capabilities for using scenario thinking and planning to better understand the impacts of climate change on federal lands and how to incorporate this information into land management planning. Scenarios will be used to explore climate change dynamics and management implications in distinct bio-regions such as the Prairie Pothole Region, northern Great Plains grasslands, desert southwest, southeast coastal region, and Yukon, AK. This approach provides important follow up to the prototype phase that was completed by the US Geological Survey agency for the National Park Service (NPS) in early 2009. The specific objectives of this follow-up phase include: 
1. Evaluation of the prototype scenario planning process and results, and identification of appropriate modification to the follow up approach.
2. Training for an expanded number of managers, scientists, resource specialists, and planners in the NPS and other agencies that can serve as part of a future cadre of scenario planning practitioners or advisors - a "train-the-trainer" approach.
3. Additional training for the previously identified core team of federal land management agency staff in designing and facilitating climate change scenario planning methodologies.
4. Identify and implement up to eight (8) additional case studies (through four (4) training workshops typically focusing on two case studies per workshop) that can be used for applying scenario planning techniques toward specific land and resource management issues in NPS units.
5. Document the process, including lessons learned, for integrating climate change in ongoing organizational processes and conversations.
6. Provide insights into strategic and institutional changes required for effective management response to climate change effects.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) , seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying information from government, academia, and industry sources regarding novel solutions for fixed and mobile tank protective system.  The immediate objective is to survey and assess the most advanced Self Sealing Coupons to prevent leakage from tanker assets after ballistic impact from 0.50 caliber AP projectile impacting at 100 ft/s above muzzle velocity containing either chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.
The intention of the self sealing concept is that a material may be applied externally to a steel vessel containing a caustic liquid. After an impact due to a 0.50 Cal. AP bullet where the bullet makes a complete penetration. The self-sealing material will close the entrance hole and either prevent or greatly reduce liquid spillage with either chlorine or anhydrous ammonia as the payload. A dependence on performance vs. temperature and internal pressure will also be studied.
This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public.  The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.  If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research.
1.0	SELF SEALING CONCEPTS
The following are design and manufacturing parameters NSWCDD will consider during assessments: a)	A material will be applied to 3 initial steel substrates provided by NSWCDD (plates will be 12" x 12" and 0.777" thickness).b)	For each company, material thickness of  1", 1 ", and 1 " will be applied to one of the three substrates.c)	Each coupon will be fired at once at the center of the target using a 0.50 cal AP round at Ambient Temperature (AT) where a complete penetration will occur.d)	After each shot, panels will be tested for self-sealing performance using a liquid with viscosity close to water and capable of remaining a liquid at temperatures of both -40 F and 130 F. Leakage will be tested at 150 psi, leakage rate will be measured at AT.e)	For each company that demonstrates successful self-sealing performance, two additional substrates will be sent.f)	The two additional substrates will have the same material applied at the thinnest thickness that meets the self-sealing performance. g)	The two additional substrates will be tested at two extreme temperatures 130 deg F and  -40 deg F.i)	Test coupons and the liquid will be placed within a temperature conditioning unit 10 hrs prior to testing to ensure thermal equilibrium at required temperature.ii)	Just prior to testing, coupons will be removed from conditioning unit and placed in target standiii)	After bullet impact self-sealing coupons will be tested for their ability to seal at the two extreme temperatures (-40 F and 130 F) at 100 and 150 psih)	For solutions that meet the performance requirements at both AT and the two extreme temperatures (at 150 psi internal pressure), an additional test of the exposure of self-sealant materials with chlorine and anhydrous ammonia will be investigated. Within this study material from the successful self sealant materials will removed and machined into six dog bones. Two of the dog bones will be tested without exposure to any chemicals. Two will be exposed in chlorine and two will be exposed to anhydrous ammonia for a period of 48 hours. After exposure all dog bones will be tested to observe any degradation in mechanical properties. 
For each solution that meets the performance requirements, down selection will be performed based on the following:a)	Costb)	Weightc)	Ease of Applicationd)	Maintainabilitye)	Availability
2.0 PLAN OF ACTION & MILESTONES
NSWCDD will conduct the Self Sealing Coupon evaluation in accordance with the following Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M):

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity Contracting Office is seeking sources for the DEFENSE IMAGERY MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS CENTER  (DIMOC) 24/7 IMAGERY OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY.  This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified companies capable of meeting the Government requirement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this RFI.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.  This FedBizOps sources sought notice is an announcement seeking market information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Governments evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), the Government may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP); however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).  All respondents are requested to identify their firms size and type of business (e.g., large business, small business, service-disabled, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611with a size standard of $7.0 million.

A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the DIMOC and the respondents potential ability to meet DIMOCs requirement.  At this time, the Government feels that sub-paragraph 2.2 explains the skills and expertise required for the requested work.   The purpose of this notice is to identify interested vendors  large businesses, small businesses, 8(a), Veterans Owned, etc., and to determine if a set-aside is warranted.  Responses should speak to the ability to perform the requirements contained in the PWS and provide evidence of successful experience regarding the core competencies.

The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  At a minimum, provide the following information in your submittal:  (1) Name of company; (2) Name of companys POC, including address, phone, and email; (3) Identify the type of entity (large business, small business, small disadvantage, woman-owned, 8(a), HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned, etc,), (4) Identify intent to team, and if possible, the anticipated teaming arrangement.  Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 and FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  In addition, the statement of qualifications should include information that clearly demonstrates the respondents capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements contained in the draft Performance Work Statement.  Send submittals to:  Defense Media Activity-Contracting Office, ATTN:  LEILA MILLER, 23755 Z Street, Riverside, CA 92518 or via email to Leila.Miller@dma.mil.  Telephone responses or inquiries will not be accepted.  Submittals are requested NOT LATER THAN 17 FEB 2010.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support; operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska. The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below. You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Period of Performance and (ii) Commercial Practices. Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired. Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted. The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force responsibilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska. Duties include (partial list) on-station management, airfield management, operations and maintenance, equipment and facilities repair and corrosion control, fire protection, power production, water treatment and distribution systems, heating systems, roads and grounds (incl. snow removal), fuels management, operations and maintenance of communications systems, weather support, and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.). The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early Spring 2010 with award in the Spring 2011 time frame, and with performance to begin on 1 October 2011. The current contract was solicited under 8(a) competition. Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement. Small businesses including veteran-owed, service disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women owned, as well as other small businesses are particularly invited to respond. The current contract was acquired under NAICS 561210, Facilities Support Services, and the corresponding size standard is $35.5M. The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether a Period of Performance of three years would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer; and if so, please explain why. The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions; however, the responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12. Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities for performing the above stated requirements and the required resources to satisfactorily perform the mission. Capability statements may be submitted to the contracting officer, Jani Faris, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506, and are requested by March 3, 2010.

<SUBJECT>The United States Mint at San Francisco (SFM) is seeking industry input on the development and installation of Induction Annealing capabilities for proof coin blanks.
<SOLNBR>USMHQ100013
<RESPDATE>040910
<CONTACT>Jina M Jackson, Contract Specialist, Phone 2023540123, Fax 2027560134, Email jina.jackson@usmint.treas.gov
<DESC>1.	Introduction:

This Request for Information (RFI) is being released to obtain the most suitable approach to acquiring the necessary services and equipment leading to a sound technical process. The United States Mint at San Francisco (SFM) is seeking industry input on the development and installation of Induction Annealing capabilities for proof coin blanks.  Proof coins are the highest quality coins produced by the United States Mint (USM) and additional information may be reviewed at www.usmint.gov.  The USM requires a Vendor Capabilities Statement along with responses to this RFI and intends to hold a Pre-Solicitation Site Visit at the SFMs facility (Actual Date: TBD) for all interested potential bidders.  


2.	Background:

The process that the USM currently uses is to rim the golden dollar blanks before annealing and all other denominations after annealing.  54 wide belt annealing furnaces with a bright annealing (reducing) atmosphere are used to process proof coin blanks.  The current temperatures are between 1000 to 1500 degrees F in the existing furnaces utilizing 4.5 % hydrogen and 96 % nitrogen reducing atmosphere.   


3.	Purpose of Objective:

The purpose of this Request for Information is to seek information about technical processes from industry to allow the USM to proceed with the development and installation of Induction Annealing systems for proof coin blanks.

To meet this requirement, the desired final equipment configuration shall be a Lean Cell one piece flow configuration that will include an upset mill (puts a rim on the blank----USM supplied) and an induction annealing system into a weight controlled single burnisher load sized (up to 29 Kg but could be as low as 14.5 kg every thirty to sixty minutes---see Table 3 at end of the RFI) container. Each system shall be designed to achieve maximum flexibility to process all or as many as possible of each of the denominations to allow full interchangeability of annealing systems.   The objective of the Lean Cell shall be to get single piece flow thru rimming, annealing and burnishing in a six to eight single denomination cells.   

Ultimately, when the USM arrives at the final production cells, the USM envisions a number (estimated: six to eight) of induction annealing systems each with about a 100 square feet footprint.  There should be a pre-heat higher powered inductor followed by additional inductors maintaining the soak temperature for the proper time to get the desired uniform finish grain size. The intent is to rotate individual blanks through the annealing flux to achieve uniform (non-stratified) properties without surface and edge defects which will allow the USM to stamp proof quality coins. 

The USM has determined from initial testing, adjacent blanks should not touch each other (rim to rim) to prevent welding.  The blanks should roll down a series of stacked ramps using gravity or be carried by conveyors while the blanks rotate on a series of horizontal ramps as contact between the blanks is not allowed as determined by the results of induction annealing trials.  The USM recognizes that blanks stacked in a column (like a roll of coins) do weld together at contact points during the induction heating process. The number of ramps and their length should generate enough time at temperature to achieve a uniform and consistent grain size range and hardness.  . To date, the USM has concluded that roll-down ramps rather than horizontal conveyors are more desirable since capital and maintenance costs would be substantially lower than having conveyors.  Conveyors or other alternative concepts may be used if it has been determined and well documented in subsequent trials that roll-down ramps are not feasible. When the blanks are above 110 degrees F, they are required to be in a protective non-oxidizing or reducing atmosphere to maintain the bright annealed finish. 

At a minimum, on the pending cell production equipment the USM needs to produce 29 Kg. of each denomination as shown in the attached Table 3 at the end of the RFI.  The twenty-nine (29) Kg burnisher load size consists of one of the following blank quantities:  5,800 clad nickels, 12,789 clad dimes, 5,115 clad quarters, 2,558 halves or 3,581 golden dollars.  

Preliminary tests have shown that full power can be applied as rapidly as possible to the clad blanks without detrimental (delaminations) results to the clad blank bond.   This will require further confirmation on the Development Equipment.  Similarly, the USM advises instantaneously quench hot clad and silver blanks directly into a water tank is acceptable and is currently so performed in the circulating production process. Such quenches do not affect the blanks properties and clad bond integrity. 


Equipment Considerations

The USM has several conditions that are required to be tested in the next development phase. These required testings shall determine the future design of production equipment. The USM also recognizes that to achieve property uniformity, the vertically oriented blanks must rotate through the inductor as they pass by in a single row channel on the rims of the blanks.  What is not recognized is whether or not the blank can be in contact with each other on the rim as they pass through the inductors. Rimming is the process currently used to upset (bump up the edge by decreasing the diameter between a set of grooved rolls) the edge or rim of a flat blank prior to stamping finish coins.   Currently it is unclear whether the USM will anneal rimmed or unrimmed blanks.  It is current USM practice to rim our golden dollar blanks before annealing and all other denominations after annealing.  The USM is willing to explore rimming all denominations before annealing.   The USM prefers to be able to anneal both blank types---rimmed and unrimmed.  The USM is not clear on the dwell time at temperature for each denomination to replicate the blank annealed properties currently in use.  In this configuration, the USM estimates this dwell time to be between 30 to 120 seconds.  This confirmation of dwell time shall be addressed in the proposal as stipulated in the test or agreed-to equivalent test apparatus referenced below.
 

Requirements:

Technical Evaluation

Ultimately a requirement of the evaluation of proposals made to a subsequent Statement of Work (yet to be issued) shall include the USMs visit to each selected bidders development facility to clarify any salient items and evaluate the bidders capabilities.  For the selected vendor, the USM will supply all needed unannealed blanks of all denominations except one cent blanks (they are not annealed at the SFM).  

Development Equipment:

The Required Tasks are expected to be as follows:

1.  At the vendors facility: develop and operate a laboratory setup of vertically oriented blanks using an acceptable method of material handling in a reducing atmosphere to test whether at the required annealing temperature (1050F to 1500F, nominal 1250 F range) contact between rotating blanks will generate unacceptable marks that prevent s the production of the highest quality proof coin sets possible. The required throughput for the induction annealing system is 29 Kg. every 30 to 50 minutes depending on the denomination (see Table 3).
 	
2.  At the vendors facility: develop and operate a laboratory setup that will determine the total amount of dwell time at the required annealing temperatures for each of the five denominations to meet required properties.  

Note: For both items #1 and #2, it is essential that a precise measurement of the temperature and time of the blanks during the test runs are available at the throughput in #1. 

3.  Obtain information and projections power usage and operating costs. 
 
4. Assist the USM in the evaluation of the properties of annealed samples and coin stamping results.

   5. Induction annealing computer modeling and simulation of the products.  







Required Deliverables in the pending Statement of Work are expected to be:  
(Comments should be provided in Excel, or Microsoft Word formats; via Fed Ex or Email.  

1. Initial: Conclusions and a report of Induction Annealing computer modeling of the b blanks at the inception of the project to give guidance to prototype development. 

2.  Intermediate:  After initial testing is adequate, using the developed concept from the above and other data  a report on the feasibility of a production volume system meeting the stated quantities with the following considerations:  throughput, reliability, operating cost, footprint, maintainability, etc. along with the projected design drawings.

3. Final: The operational prototype development equipment, drawings, bill of materials, operating data and manuals.  

4.  Induction annealed blanks, determination of proper annealing times and temperatures, vendor report of power usage, transformer types required, operating costs, and comments on feasibility in full production. Custom channel inductors and their specifications and ramp(s), test conveyor(s) and feeder(s).

5. Provide a minimum maintenance material handling which is essential in the production systems.

5.  A formal report to be provided to the Contracting Technical Representative (COTR) (Date: TBD) incorporating all facts and findings and final determinations of each of the deliverables.

6.  All USM supplied materials shall be returned to the Contracting Technical Representative (COTR).


After completion of the above developmental phase, the successful vendor will have the opportunity to submit a proposal for design, development, and build of five to eight production induction annealing systems. The purchase of the production systems will be in phases:  The first phase will be one full operating system installed at the SFM and five to seven subsequent options for identical or improved induction annealing systems.

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a six month sole source extension to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems, Inc. under authority of 40 U.S.C. 121(c), FAR 8.405-6 and DFARS 208.405-70. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Nuclear Planning and Execution Systems (NPES) Operational Support for USSTRATCOM / J865. The primary objective of this NPES support task order is the continued sustainment, requirements determination and processing, analysis, operational testing, and deployment/battle staff support for NPES and the national strategic command and control decision support system. This task order provides Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) to properly support, test, operate, and install all NPES hardware and software. Communication systems have inherent data needs, often require automatic planning support, and must interface to other networked systems, printers, and displays. Contractor support assists with properly developing, implementing, testing, planning, managing, and operating such systems. A Top Secret clearance with eligibility for Special Compartment Information (SCI), Nuclear Command and Control (NC2), and Crypto access is required for contractor personnel involved with operational plans, and with network and emergency actions procedures related to this task.
<p>The follow-on effort's source selection will not be completed by 31 Mar 10, the end date of the current period of performance. Therefore, the Government intends to extend the current task order for six months (1 Apr 10 through 30 Sep 10) to allow time for completion of the follow-on source selection.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide NPES Operational Support services at full performance starting 1 Apr 10 through 30 Sep 10 (6 months), provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer and a copy to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 8 Feb 10.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT PROJECT: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS PROJECT OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTORS UNDER THE CURRENT MALMSTROM AFB, MT SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION OF BASE ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS (SABER) INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) CONTRACT.<br /><br /><br /><br />Project Number 98-2006<br />RFP 10-02 Revision 1<br />HARDENED INTERSITE CABLE SYSTEM (HICS) ACCESS GATES<br />DATE: 12 JANUARY 2010
<p><br />GENERAL: The contractor shall perform all services necessary to accomplish complete installation of the proposed project. This installation shall be accomplished in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) specifications, the associated drawings, and additional requirements of the Statement of Work as discussed in the following paragraphs. The contractor shall comply with pertinent sections of the SABER specifications in relation to the work identified in the project, whether or not specific sections are referenced. When attached the 341st Missile Engineering Specifications shall take precedence over the standard specifications used in accordance with the current SABER contract</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall provide all labor, material, equipment and incidentals necessary to add, remove, repair, replace 16 or 26 foot wide barbed or woven wire HICS Access Gates. The place of performance will be at HICS Access Gates within a 140 mile radius of Great Falls and located throughout the 564th and 10th Squadrons, 341 Missile Complex, Malmstrom AFB. The 564th Missile Squadron is the P, Q, R, S, and T Flights starting at Dutton, MT and north to Shelby, MT, West to Pendroy, MT and East to Tiber Reservoir. The 10th Missile Squadron consists of the A, B, C, D and E Flights starting East of Great Falls near Stockett, MT and continuing east to Winifred, MT. See Contractor Maps included on CD and Sample Gate Density maps included at the end of this document.</p>
<p>The total number of gates awarded will be based on the money budgeted for this project divided by the average cost per gate. The total number of gates awarded may be between 400-800 gates, Revision 1- the Government anticipates a quantity of 600. Winter exclusion for 1 Nov to 1 April will be in effect if all work cannot be completed by 1 Nov.</p>
<p>All work will occur on non secure HICS Right-of-Way within private property. Due to the nature of the work locations scheduling with the Revision 1- Landowner and Cable Affairs Office is paramount. The HICS easement is 16.5 feet wide and travels through all terrain conditions including mountains, cultivated fields, irrigated fields, and grazing land Therefore, all equipment used shall be kept to a minimum size. Any materials removed during the course of this project shall be legally disposed of off of the Landowner's and U. S. Government Property.</p>
<p>During the course of this project the Contractor will be given the GPS Coordinates of each gate needing repair. This information shall be used to call in locates and serve as directions to the work location. A file of the gates needing repair is included on the CD so that you can calculate the average distance between gates needing repairs and what to expect for work at each gate.</p>
<p>Also, for estimation purposes the performance period shall be calculated as a fraction of a day per gate. For example 1 day performance period / 5 gates = 40 day performance period/ 200 gates.</p>
<p>Picture of typical HICS Cable Access Gate repair work is included as Figure 1.<br /><br />Figure 1. Typical HICS 16.5 foot Cable Access Gate</p>
<p>In order to calculate an average gate cots the estimator shall disregard the grand total calculated by the WINEST Software instead an average "Per gate" cost shall be hand calculated with the following formula and descriptions found on page 3:</p>
<p>(01 Add New Gate+02 Remove Gate+03 Post and Cross Brace Repair)/3</p>
<p>+ 04 Mobilization</p>
<p>=Average total Gate Cost</p>
<p>Average Total gate Cost * Coefficient Factor = Coefficient Total</p>
<p>Per Gate cost = Average total Gate Cost + Coefficient total</p>
<p><br />For Example:</p>
<p>($350+$150+$200)/3+$60 =$293.33 Average Gate Cost</p>
<p>$293.33*.10 = $29.33 Coefficient Total</p>
<p>"Per Gate" cost = $322.66 = $293.33 + $29.33</p>
<p><br />01 Add New Gate: This item shall account for the cost of an installation of a new gate as shown on the project drawings at the location included in the gate data file.</p>
<p>02 Remove Gate: This item shall account for labor and disposal of a typical gate as shown on the project drawings.</p>
<p>03 Post and Cross Brace Repair: This item shall account for the repair of a vertical post or horizontal cross brace of repair as denoted in the included gate data file. For estimation purposes the extent of the repair may include one post replacement and a horizontal cross brace replacement.</p>
<p>04 Mobilization: Mobilization and Demobilization will be calculated once per day of work. For estimation purposes the Offeror shall follow the included example above. Mob/Demob casot shall be averaged on a per gate basis. For example: (1 Mob/day + 1 Demob/day)/ 5 Gates = 2/5 = 0.4 mob/demob cost factor for each gate. Therefore, a quantity of only 1 shall be entered into the WINEST Takeoff Quantity Column because the mob and demob for each gate is included in the cost factor.<br /><br />SPECIFICATIONS: When applicable the 341st Missile Engineering Specifications shall take precedence over the standard specifications used in accordance with the current SABER contract. On the included CD to this document shall be Section 1000- General Requirements (5 pages) and Section 02000- Technical Requirements (4 Pages).</p>
<p>SUBMITTALS: See attached submittal schedule. Additionally, any material to be used and not listed on submittal schedule must be approved before using.<br />The contractor shall provide samples and submittals to the contracting officer as required in the submittal schedule provided with this SOW and SABER contract obligations.</p>
<p>Revision 1- Contractor shall submit before and after photos of the work completed at each gate to serve as proof of the work completed. Each photo shall be named before or after with the site coordinates (i.e. Before, 123,567.00, 987,442.00) and include the date and time signature on each photo. Each photo shall be placed on a disk and submitted with an Excel data file. The Excel Data File shall include the gate GPS Coordinates and an annotation of the work completed. This Excel data file and the photos will serve as verification for payment. Contractor at a minimum shall prepare two (2) stand alone disks with all photos and Excel data. These disks shall be submitted at the time of each progress payment request. Failure to provide all required information pertaining to the progress payment request is grounds for rejection.</p>
<p>CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS: Contractor shall prepare, at a minimum, four (4) 24 x 36 sheets (cover sheet, demo/new site plan, electrical distribution &amp; details). 95% drawings shall be submitted with the contractor's proposal. The Government will provide to the contractor preliminary drawings and information compiled from Missile Engineering's most recent data.</p>
<p><br />CONSTRUCTION ESTIMATE: Estimate shall be sorted / subtotaled by the Location Codes used in the "blanked estimate" supplied. The proposed performance period (in calendar days) must be attached to estimate. All estimate quantities shall be based on a "Per Gate" Cost.</p>
<p>ASBUILT DRAWINGS: Revision 1 The Contractor prepared Detail Design Drawings shall be updated to reflect As-Built configuration IAW Section 01010 of the SABER specifications. After approval of the redlined blueprints, the full-sized Mylar originals shall be updated and shall be stamped as "AS-BUILTS".</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing intends to place an order with Flint Group Flexographic Group Flexographic Products for three hundred (300) PLATES BLANK OFFSET BASF WS II 73 W (29.72 IN. X 33.07 IN) FOR USE IN THE OFFSET PLATE MAKING SECTION. PLATES ARE TO BE STORED IN A COOL DRY ENVIRONMENT (10 DEGREES - 25 DEGRESS C.) AND A RELATIVE HUMIDITY OF MAX. 50%. KBA recommends the use of Flint Group blank plates for their presses in order to maximize the detailed and sharp print quality of the fine lines the BEP has incorporated into the BEP's NexGen of US Currency. Additionally, Flint Group is the OEM of the plate processing equipment that the BEP has acquired to support NexGen production which is currently under warranty with Flint Group Printing Plates. The Flint Group will not stand by their equipment performance standards if other blank plates are used on their processing equipment. In order to ensure that NexGen currency meets all minimum performance details and design at the detailed level necessary to thwart counterfeiters, the use of Flint Group blank plates are the only plates that will meet BEP's minimum needs throughout the pre-press production process on the Flint Group and KBA Giori processing equipment. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 and 13.106-1. The resulting purchase order shall not exceed the simplified purchase threshold. This procurement is for propriety materials created exclusively for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.500 shall be used. Please forward any questions to Mark Anderson on (202) 874-6255 or Mark.Anderson@bep.treas.gov.

The final product will provide the public with a visual representation of the Sound and its recovery after 20 years, including the intersection of injured resources and services and the economic, cultural, and subsistence value of these resources and services to the communities.  The mapguide will create a visual and narrative record of the resources, services, and stories that define the Sound, and communicate a vision for how they should be shared and protected in the face of increasing human use.  It will serve as an educational tool for guiding human users in the Sound in such a manner that increasing use does not result in confounding the recovery of resources and services injured by the spill.  The contractor will help organize and lead the map development process by, among other things, facilitating the collection and integration of information (e.g. broad themes and specific stories) about the Sound, while also assisting the communities in developing a vision for place that takes into consideration critical human uses, such as recreation/tourism.

<DESC>RECOVERY - In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Public Law 111-5, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with the Front Range GigaPop (FRGP) to acquire high-speed fiber optic connectivity to support NOAA's high performance computing (HPC), voice, video and data communication requirements in the northeastern region of NOAA's National Research Network (NRN). Physical connectivity, installation and monthly reoccurring charges for origination and termination of each circuit is also included in this acquisition.
<p>NOAA currently acquires its high-speed fiber optic connectivity through its membership with several regional research consortiums, including the FRGP. As a member of these consortiums, NOAA was granted privileged use of their optical networks. This acquisition is proposed between the government and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) located in Boulder, Colorado, who manages and operates the FRGP. NOAA requires high-speed fiber optic connectivity to the Internet2 and National Lambda Rail Research networks for NOAA High Performance Computing resources in the Rocky Mountain Front Range region of the United States that satisfies all of the following:<br />1. Access to the lowest latency, highest capacity, highest quality data transfer throughput available for the lowest possible price;</p>
<p>2. Leverages NOAA's current investment in its optical network infrastructure, maximizing its return-on-investment (ROI);</p>
<p>3. Leverages NOAA's substantial research investment as a long standing member of multiple research consortiums;</p>
<p>4. Leverages NOAA's current and future network access privileges granted through consortium "Indefeasible Right of Use" agreements (IRUs);</p>
<p>5. Maintains NOAA's leadership role within the national, next-generation internet research community;</p>
<p>6. Honors NOAA's long standing commitments to its consortium partners and reduces adverse impacts on consortium members;</p>
<p>7. Leverages current unallocated capacity to communicate with multiple organizations within the optical network;</p>
<p>8. Provides high data integrity and data security.</p>
<p>9. Opportunity and advantage to collaborate with federal agencies, labs, non-profit organizations, universities, libraries, and technology and information service providers throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Network connectivity and associated services required include: <br />1. Update the Bi-State Optical Network (BiSON) Northern Route fiber segments between Boulder, Longmont, Fort Collins, Laramie, Stateline, Platteville, and Denver to provide 10/40/100G capability over current 1/10G.</p>
<p>2. In support of the BiSON fiber segments update, purchase, or contract for, equipment, maintenance, network engineering support, and other incidental services necessary for successful upgrade.</p>
<p>3. Provision NOAA required 10/40/100G dedicated waves via the updated BiSON fiber segment.</p>
<p>4. Contract for fiber builds as required for BiSON upgrade and maintenance purposes.</p>
<p>5. Contract for collocation and cross connects within the suite at 1850 Pearl St., Denver, CO, including all maintenance, hardware, and engineering required in order to interconnect NOAA NRN hardware with FRGP, BiSON, NLR and I2 hardware.</p>
<p>6. Purchase or contract for, National LambdaRail, NLR network services and operational expenses necessary to provide the NLR network services required including related layer one, layer two, and layer three services for NOAA.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately March 3, 2010, with a base year and four option years. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 with a corresponding size standard of $6.5M.</p>
<p>This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due date set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. It is the Government's belief that only the Front Range GigaPop regional network consortium can provide these required services.</p>

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  The customized buildings described above will maintain consistency with existing construction practices and aesthetics of Brooks Camp in Katmai National Park, Alaska.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background:  Katmai National Park and Preserve needs to install new buildings for the Picnic area at Brooks Camp.  The buildings to be constructed are a picnic shelter and a sweet smelling vault tank restrooms and vault tank accessories for a new sweet smelling vault toilet restroom often referred to as a SST.  The SST building will also have a storage room and janitors room.  Restroom facilities are needed to meet health and safety issues at Brooks Camp Developed Area.  A new restroom that is a sweet smelling vault toilet facility and is approved by Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation is going to be constructed in 2010.  The picnic shelter is needed to keep visitors out of the weather in rain or severe weather conditions which occur frequently at Brooks Camp. This vault toilet restroom with a storage room for day use park visitors and picnic shelter should become among the most used buildings and the most used restroom in the park.  These buildings will be at the primary location visitors arrive at the park via float plane or at Brooks Camp via boat.  The incoming visitors are riding frequently in excess of an hour from where they departed.  There have been many complaints at lack of facilities for eating picnic lunches and restroom.  The lodge has the closet public restroom and it is over 500 feet from where it is needed. It is well established that a rest room facility is needed close to where park visitor facilities are located. The shelter and storage for day use visitors are needed to accommodate visitors who during poor weather conditions utilize the roofed over porch of the visitor contact station right on a highly used trail by both people and bears at the site.   This site is within a 100 feet of the visitor auditorium, a picnic area and the Visitor Contact Station.  
The site near the Visitor Contact Station has frequently seen visitors relieving themselves in this vicinity as they have to go and not finding the lodge restroom close by, the visitor will choose the woods. As when the need arises to relieve oneself, the need is immediate, to get the lodge restroom is a difficulty as we do not have directions and it is over 500 feet away.  The park concessioner lodge would prefer that the visitors who are not customers use park facilities. The lodge has complained about this problem and this too needs to be addressed.  The park has no public restroom facilities nearby and the closest restroom facilities are at the campground over a  mile away or on the other side of the Brooks River which is also more than a 1/3 of a mile away.
The park has five sweet smelling vault toilets (SST's) already and has used the same construction and the same brands for all five vault toilets so far.  The park would like to construct the same vault toilet as the parts and logs are interchangeable and easily replaced if a part should go bad or be destroyed by a bear.  Also the source needs to be dependable and reliable as far as supplying parts too. Another major point is that the appearance of the vault toilets should be consistent with park vault toilet buildings that already are in existence. 
The park and concessioner have used Panabode construction through the Brooks Camp area and to be consistent with the historic architecture of the site Panabode products need to be used. The park has chosen to use vault toilets as they are Alaska DEC approved and can operate beyond the season that the park can provide utilities (water and sewer) for lodge operation.  The vault toilet restrooms are also much less expensive to install restrooms with water and sewer too. Many visitors and park employees come before the lodge is open and after the lodge is closed and when no water and sewer is available and the only choice is to use the woods.  Vault toilets are useable year round and can be pumped as needed. The park has a pumping and servicing personal.
1.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302.1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Pan-Abode buildings are used around the Brooks Camp area and have a distinguished log building architecture and signature as a recognized building for the Brooks Camp area in Katmai National park.  Pan-Abode is used for the concessioner and NPS buildings. When Brooks Camp first was developed with a government contract in 1974 all of the new buildings were Pan-Abode log structures. Pan-Abode was chosen for many reasons. The reason Pan-Abode is chosen at this time is to maintain consistency with existing construction practices and aesthetics. The goal is to keep all new construction as close as possible to existing architectural construction.  There are many companies that provide log structures but none that match Pan Abode's unique look, shape and texture.
Pan-Abode products are reasonable in price and competitive to other manufacturers of log structures. Their products have been around for many years and are still made with a distinctive look and quality cedar logs used for their construction. The company has good quality control and has proven itself to be reliable and consistent with its products. 
The park has five SST vault toilet restroom facilities in the park and all are made using Pan-Abode buildings and Romtec tanks and accessories.  The Sweet Smelling Toilets (SST) and Pan-Abode buildings have demonstrated themselves to be safe and sanitary restroom facilities and approved by the AK DEC.  Legislation requires Katmai National Park and Preserve to provide appropriate and necessary services that provides resource-based recreation that does not impair resource values.  Obtaining adequate restroom facilities will alleviate trash and human waste upon park resources and in turn preserve and protect one of the park purposes; protection of habitats for and populations of fish and wildlife, including high concentrations of brown bear. The park has been purchasing Pan-Abode cedar buildings since 1974 and it is a dependable company and the concessioner has been using Pan-Abode even before this time for the lodge facilities. 
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. In order to provide Park Visitors the opportunity to utilize park facilities that match existing visitor use facilities in appearance, the picnic shelter and vault toilet building must be procured.  In order to construct buildings similar to the other park visitor use buildings so they are easily identifiable as park buildings Pan-Abode building should be used. The park has contracted with Pan-Abode to provide the buildings that match this configuration of the accessories that are provided by Romtec. See requisition form for items to be ordered and schedule for delivery. Delivery should be before June 15, 2010 so it can be hauled on one of the first barge runs to Brooks Camp across Naknek Lake
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).When the park constructed its first public restroom SST's in 1996; Romtec was the only source for Vault Toilets that the park could find and to stay uniform with building appearance Pan-Abode was contracted to get a design that fit the Romtec accessories.  We have not found a similar cedar building that makes identical products.  The logs need to be interchangeable for making repairs we have not found not interchangeable with Pan-Abode logs and accessories. To stay consistent with the same design and interchangeable logs the park needs to stay with Pan-Abode cedar homes for the two buildings. The Pan-Abode structure that the park has used to construct over and around the Romtec accessories was specially designed to fit the SST design we are utilizing. Also the crews are familiar with the design and construction which has sped up the speed of construction with each installation. Both Pan-Abode and Romtec has provided good support over the years and was able to provide replacement parts in a timely manner. This is important especially when bears tend to try and destroy parts to the toilets and the buildings. To be able to replace broken or damaged parts is critical in keeping the toilets operational. And an ability to keep spare parts that will match any SST facility is critical. The parts are needed in King Salmon by June 15, 2010 in time for the park barge runs across Naknek Lake.

4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: In a web search only there are other cedar home makers but the logs are not compatible with Pan-Abode logs which are replaceable. The products are similar but not exact matches for having interchangeable logs with previously constructed buildings. The logs are of the exact log design of the existing outhouses and older Pan-Abode structures. No other manufactures can meet this critical design specification. Pan-Abode is the only company and distributor of Pan Abode log structures. 

5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The NPS KATM has identified that no other cedar log home manufacturers t have the same logs with the same specifications. The Panabode structure that the park has used to construct over and around the Romtec accessories was specially designed to fit the SST design. We have the Pan-Abode plans now and the park construction crew is familiar with the design and construction which has sped up the speed of construction with each installation. Any other manufacturer would have to make a design that we already have for Pan-Abode that works with the SST accessories the park has been using and for existing structures.  Pan-Abode logs are made with the same specifications that the previous park buildings in the park have.  This makes obtaining replacement logs available when needed.  Logs in park have been replaced too mostly because bears have destroyed logs before.  To be able to replace logs is an advantage when they are already made to specification rather than custom making replacement logs.  
6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.The park already has 5 each Pan-Abode Romtec SST restroom facilities, the parks new visitor use buildings from 1974 onward have been predominantly Pan-Abode.  The park would like to stick with the same architectural appearance that is Pan-Abode appearance, for all of the reasons stated in previous sections of this document.  The park service required that Katmailand the park concessioner to continue to purchase structures identical to the aforementioned buildings in order to maintain the historical consistency of existing architecture as well. It is only logical the park should continue to purchase Pan-Abode for visitor support buildings as long as the concessioner is required to do the same.

<CONTACT>Robyn E. King, Email soad@dhs.gov
<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, whereas there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements.
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the necessary accounting, budgetary, general ledger and sub-ledgers, systems/subsystems review, analysis, and remediation support necessary to ensure that TSA's Treasury fund accounts are materially accurate. Specifically, TSA requires the continued delivery of vital accounting and financial reporting, policy and procedure development, and accounting expertise support to assist the TSA in complying with external oversight.</p>
<p>Currently, the Office of Acquisition is in the process of recompeting these requirements. As such, the proposed "bridge" labor hour contract will continue to provide accounting expertise support so there is no loss of audit progress due to a break in service. The necessary "bridge" contract is anticipated to provide service for a period of two months (March 1, 2010 - April 30, 2010) with a one month option period (May 1, 2010 - May 29, 2010). This sole source procurement action will allow the Office of Finance and Administration to receive the support it needs to continue to make financial progress on reconciling TSA's financial statements until the new contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a contract to AOC Solutions, located at 14151 Newbrook Drive, Suite 200, Chantilly, VA 20151. This contract will address the requirements of TSA's Office of Finance and Administration financial reporting mediation work.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>

<DESC><p>BAA 0001-10<br />BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<br />FOR<br />DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)<br />INDUSTRIAL BASE INNOVATION FUND <br />________________________________________<br />POINT OF CONTACT: Mr. John Dormer, Contracting Officer <br />Defense Supply Center Philadelphia<br />DLA Contracting Support Office DCSO-P<br />700 Robbins Avenue, Building 26-1<br />Philadelphia, PA 19111 <br />john.dormer@dla.mil</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND<br />The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF). Congressional Report 111-35, page 96 states "Finally, the committee recommends an additional $30 million (changed to $20M in Conference) to continue the Industrial Base Innovation Fund program. The committee directs that DLA, jointly with the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Industrial Policy, continue to make investments in manufacturing research that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material." <br />http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:sr035.111.pdf</p>
<p>The IBIF web site is located at: https://www.dodmantech.com/ibif/. The DLA is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) in executing the IBIF. Accordingly, all proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that will meet Congressional Direction. The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing research supporting the Aviation, Maritime, Land and Troop Support Supply Chains. The goal of the IBIF program is to implement significant manufacturing improvements into these supply chains. Projects executed by and implemented in the lower tiers of the industrial base (i.e. component and material suppliers) are encouraged as they are viewed as more likely to achieve the IBIF goals.</p>
<p>Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $20 million during Fiscal Year 2010 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA. The expected cost limit for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $1,000,000 per proposal with a period of performance of up to 24 months. The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current systems or troop support items.</p>
<p>This BAA shall result in the award of multiple contracts. The Government contemplates award of cost type contracts. Proposals based on a type of contract other than that contemplated shall be rejected and shall not be evaluated and shall be rated as unacceptable. FAR 16.301-3 states that a cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when the contractor's accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. To be eligible for award of a cost contract, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources; have an accounting system approved for performing a cost type contract, ability to comply with performance schedules and a prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment.</p>
<p>Following evaluation of proposals, offerors will be notified of selection or non-selection via the Federal Business Opportunities website and the IBIF website. Offerors of selectable proposals will be notified by phone. Selectable proposals will be considered for funding; non-selectable proposals will be destroyed. (One copy of non-selectable proposals may be retained for file purposes). Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability and merits of the proposal. Proposals may be considered for funding for a period of up to 24 months.</p>
<p>The vision for the IBIF Program is to continue to make investments in manufacturing research that address defense industrial base shortfalls, especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material. The objective is to ensure that the industrial base on which the Department of Defense (DoD) depends is reliable, cost-effective, and responsive to DoD requirements. The IBIF program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors.</p>
<p>The IBIF program is focusing on the transition of technology to the industrial base after the development cycle. The emphasis is on improving surge capability for near-term military operations and in areas that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material</p>
<p>2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION</p>
<p>Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0001-10 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 5 April 2010 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered. No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same shall be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. This is an unrestricted acquisition. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology. Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan. For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462. All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred. Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be rejected and shall not be evaluated and shall be rated as unacceptable.</p>
<p>3. TECHNICAL AREAS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>The primary focus of IBIF is the industrial base. The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land, Maritime, and Troop Support. Supply chains are not directly correlated to a Military Service (Army, Navy and Air Force). For example, all missiles are included in the Aviation supply chain. If there is a missile related proposal, it should identify the specific missile/weapon system and the proposal's position in the supply chain (prime, subcontractor, etc) to implement the IBIF proposal results. The Troop Support Supply Chain includes Clothing and Textile Products (e.g. Uniforms, Body Armor etc.), Combat Rations (e.g. Meals-Ready-to-Eat, Unitized Group Ration, etc.), Construction and Equipment (e.g., Barrier material), and Medical (e.g, vaccine production).</p>
<p>The technology thrusts of interest are Metals, Composites, and Electronics. The highest priority will be placed on investments made in areas that address defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material. At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies; however, each offeror must identify a target implementation for the proposed technology. Proposals without a clearly identified target implementation of value to one or more of the areas of interest in the BAA will not be considered for award. A target implementation must be expressed in terms of a weapon system, weapon system component or other class of militarily significant materiel, for example, F-22, M-RAP, or Body Armor system. All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; implementing dual use (capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; and manufacturing research that addresses defense industrial base shortfalls especially related to surge production requirements and diminishing sources of defense material.</p>
<p>4. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. Evaluation of proposals shall be accomplished through a detailed review of each proposal, using the following criteria listed in descending order of relative importance. See Section 5 for more detail.</p>

Any cover letter, transmittal letter, introductory page, index, table of contents or anything else attached to the Technical Proposal shall be counted against the 15 page limitation.<br />Proposals that do not comply with these requirements shall be rejected and shall not be evaluated and shall be rated as unacceptable.</strong></p>
<p>TECHNICAL PROPOSAL</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal shall contain the following sections:<br />1. Section I: A. Cover Page: (1) BAA number; (2) Supply Chain (Aviation, Land Maritime or Troop Support) (3) Technical Thrusts (Metals, Composites or Electronics); (4) Target implementation; (5) Proposal Title; (6) Technical Point of Contact, including name, telephone number, FAX number, e-mail address, and mailing address; (7) Administrative/Contracting Point of Contact, including name, telephone number, FAX number, e-mail address, and mailing address; (8) Cage code; and (9) Contractor's business type selected among the following categories: Large Business, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Other Small Business, HBCU, MI, Other Educational, or Other Nonprofit. B. Summary of the Costs. The information contained in this section should be limited to one page. The Cover Page counts towards the 15 page limit and shall be labeled as Page One.</p>
<p>2. Section II: Executive Summary: An Executive Summary of the offeror's proposed project is required. This summary shall not be evaluated but shall be used to gain an understanding of the overall proposal contents. It should identify and highlight significant features, summarize innovative claims and unique contribution(s) of the proposal, and include the salient points of the proposed project, including target system applications and the expected outcome improvement associated with the project. The information contained in this section should be limited to two pages. The Executive Summary page(s) count(s) towards the 15 page limit and shall be labeled as Page Two (and Page Three if appropriate).</p>
<p>3. Section III : Detailed Proposal Information: The following evaluation factors must be addressed in the Detailed Proposal Information:</p>
<p>(1) SCOPE, METRICS TO MEASURE SUCCESS, TIME FRAME FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPECTED BENEFITS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION: Offeror's proposal must explicitly show the target implementation of the proposed technology to specific weapon systems, weapon system component or other militarily significant materiel. For the primary target implementation a point of contact (POC) must be identified in the proposal. The POC information must include name, phone number, email, and organization code and relationship to the target implementation e.g. program manager. The Contracting Officer or his/her representative reserve the option of contacting the POC to confirm implementation assertions contained in the proposal. Implementations that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not appropriate for IBIF funding. If offeror's proposal designates a single system or item of military materiel for the initial implementation it must also provide a specific path for implementation on other weapon systems/military materiel. For example, the BAA response may be for an implementation on the F-18, but it would also have to clearly show a path for implementation on the F-22, F-35, or other weapon system platform.</p>
<p>Proposals should identify the tier of the industrial base which will implement the IBIF improvement and the timeframe for implementation. Prime contractors or R&amp;D service providers, must specifically identify the project commitment, participation, and involvement by the lower tier DOD supplier. Component and material suppliers must specifically identify the project commitment, participation, and involvement by the Prime contractor and, if applicable, the Military Service Engineering Support Activity. Proposals must include POC information for organizations referenced in the proposal (see POC info above). <br />Proposals should identify the metrics of success for the proposal and the timeframe for putting the technology into production in the target implementation. Metrics should be quantifiable and include baseline, threshold, and objective value estimates. The proposal should address how the manufacturing technology will address short term needs of the Department of Defense and the expected benefits. Address any impediments to implementing the technology and how those impediments will be overcome by the proposed effort. Offerors are cautioned that statements regarding the ability to implement manufacturing technology projects may be validated with Government engineering activities. For example, if an advanced material substitution is proposed the Offeror must demonstrate an understanding of the issues associated with and a schedule for getting the proposed substitution approved or qualified by the Cognizant Engineering Authority.</p>
<p>Proposal should address how the proposed technology will transition to the industrial base. The requirement is for a clearly written assessment of the need for the technology within the industrial base, the specific sectors where it will be implemented, and the expected benefits of that implementation in terms of surge production requirements and/or diminishing sources of defense material.</p>
<p>(2) OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT: Offerers will propose a manufacturing research project that includes: (a) The improved Defense manufacturing capability to be established, expressed in terms of outcomes that are important to the Warfighter, Systems Program Office and/or Logistics Support Organization; (b) Statement of Work (SOW) written in plain English detailing the scope of the effort and citing specific tasks to be performed and specific contractor performance requirements; (c) Detailed technical approach, rationale, and strategy for accomplishing technical goals in support of innovative claims and deliverables; (d) Deliverables associated with the proposed research including a clear description of the results, products, and transferable technology should be provided. (e) Realism of the schedule and milestones for each task in the proposed efforts. Include all proprietary claims to results, prototypes, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototypes. If there are no proprietary claims, this should be stated.</p>
<p>(3) PAST PERFORMANCE AND SCIENTIFIC/ MANUFACTURING/ TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE: Offerors shall provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest, and how that expertise shall be beneficial to this program and their track record in dealing with system manufacturing. Offerors shall provide the five largest accounts/contracts/projects within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program. Offerors shall include at least (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided, as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers. If no past performance related to systems manufacturing is available, offerors shall describe their track record in dealing with their comparable major customers and shall include supplemental information similar to that requested above.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that the government reserves the right to evaluate relevant past performance not included in the technical proposal.</p>
<p>(4) ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT: Offerors shall provide evidence of how the contract shall be managed and show that its organizational structure shall ensure performance stability, reliable customer service and commitment to DLA and IBIF for the duration of the contract performance period. Specifically, offerors shall identify key personnel including the Project Coordinator permanently assigned to the contract; and other personnel with relevant qualifications and experience.</p>
<p>COST PROPOSAL <br />The Cost Proposal shall be submitted in a separate document/volume. The cost of each major cost element and the make-up of those costs shall be presented in the offeror's proposal. Sufficient information shall be provided in supporting documents to evaluate the reasonableness and realism of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, material purchases, fair market rental value of lease items and the method used for making such evaluations.

<p>2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>SAC San Diego has a fleet of approximately 530 domestic vehicles. The SAC fleet consists of small, medium and a few large vehicles that range from sedans, vans, passenger trucks and SUV's. These vehicles are routinely used for official law enforcement duties. The SAC fleet is turned over at a rate of approximately 18% annually. The specific number of storage spaces required is unknown in advance. The budget, mission and vehicle life cycles are each variables that dictate the interval in which a SAC vehicle is taken out of service.</p>
<p>The removal from fleet service for vehicles normally requires storage for about 90 days. Maintenance, service, towing, and or upkeep by the storage facility are not required in this contract. Any direct or indirect costs associated with maintaining, towing, or upkeep outside the occasional jump start, of stored vehicles are not allowed. Access to the storage facility is required during normal business hours only. All SAC vehicles must be transferred in or out of the storage facility by/with a representative from the SAC office. SAC San Diego does not require any documentation or assistance from the storage facility beyond the storage contract requirements.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>3.1 The Contractor storage facility on a daily basis shall provide outdoor spaces for the storage of operable/inoperable domestic GOVs. Indoor storage is acceptable, but at no time is SAC San Diego willing to pay more than the outdoor storage rate. The actual number of spaces used will vary between 0 to 50 spaces at any given time on a daily basis (see Attachment 1 Pricing Schedule for estimated GOVs requiring storage).</p>
<p>3.2 Access to Vehicles: The contractor storage facility shall be located within a 30 mile radius of 185 West F street San Diego, CA 92101.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a robust and reliable, ultra-compact and light-weight two-dimensional (2D) X-ray detector, which shall provide a low background and/or zero dark current without the need for a separate cooling system, shall have a large linear dynamic range of response to X-ray intensity without a significant pixel spread function, and shall be suitable for operation at a rapid frame rate over a specified (broad) range of hard X-ray energies in small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. This detector shall form part of a permanently set-up 2D SAXS measurement capability that shall complement an existing ultra small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) capability, built previously by NIST in collaboration with the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. The new 2D SAXS capability must be accommodated within the existing USAXS instrument, with the 2D SAXS and the USAXS components interchangeable by computer controlled precision translation stages. It is this requirement that places severe constraints on the
size and weight of the new 2D SAXS detector.

All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line items(s):

Line Item 0001 : The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, 2D X-ray detector system for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications: 

(1) Compact and light-weight 2D single photon counting detector:
dimensions < 100 mm x 150 mm x 200 mm and mass < 6 kg; 
(2) No external cooling or gas supply system, as these cannot be accommodated within the space available;
(3) Detector area: > 80 mm x 30 mm;
(4) Fast counting rate: > 106 photons s-1 per pixel and frame rate > 100 Hz (but detector shall be protected from direct incident synchrotron X-ray beam);
(5) Large dynamic range for linear detector response to changing photon counting rate:
> 18 bits (1: > 262,000) with no dark current (finite background limits the number of
useful bits); single photon counting is preferred;
(6) Usable X-ray energy range: 5 keV to 30 keV with energy resolution better than 1 keV;
(7) 2D spatial resolution: pixel size < 200 &#956;m x 200 &#956;m, with negligible point spread function for neighboring pixels; NIST considers the point spread function to be negligible when the signal in one pixel should not measurably affect the signal in the neighboring pixels, i.e. the 18-bit linear detector response to photon count rate is maintained in the neighboring pixels independent of the count rate in the first pixel;
(8) All ancillary electronics and computer hardware and software for detector set-up and data buffering/processing/storage, shall be compatible with SPEC and EPICS beam line control software. EPICS refers to the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System, and is a set of Open Source software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific instruments such as particle accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific experiments. The basic link is: http://www.epics.org/ and the implementation of EPICS specific to the Advanced Photon Source has its own link:  http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/ . SPEC is a UNIX-based software package for instrument control and data acquisition widely used for X-ray diffraction at synchrotrons around the world and in university, national and industrial laboratories. The basic link is:  http://www.certif.com/spec.html. In both cases, all we require is compatibility.


Installation/Warranty:

1.  The contractor shall provide full installation instructions.  In lieu of on-sight installation and training by the contractor, the contractor shall guarantee full phone access by a technician who is an expert in the installation, set-up, operation, trouble shooting and maintenance of the system.  

2.  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a One (1) Year Warranty.  Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed no later than 9 months after receipt of an order. 

FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA :  Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement, 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be more important than price.  If technical capability and past performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

Award will be made on a best-value basis.  Under the Technical Capabilities factor, additional consideration will be given for a system that provides single photon counting as referenced in specification (5).  


Technical Capability:  Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which addresses all specifications & clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein. Image plate, charge couple device (CCD), CMOS hybrid pixel, reverse bias silicon diode array, and other detection methodologies are admissible, provided the above minimum technical requirements are met in their entirety.

Past Performance:  Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the products and services, provided by the Contractor.  NIST shall expect trouble-free (and preferably maintenance-free) operation in normal use without measurable loss in performance for at least 5 years, based on the suppliers specifications, and on customer experience with this or related products from the same supplier and this shall be considered when evaluating Past Performance.
Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information from other sources, including NIST.  

Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees and only small businesses shall be considered for award as this requirement is set-aside 100% for small business.
In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified. For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed.  

The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished as a raw material 
to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an Environmental Chamber for a diffractometer made in-house by NIST.  NIST conducts experiments with a diffractometer for which the temperature of the samples in the apparatus must be as constant as possible. The laboratory temperature is unreliable and may vary as much as 2.5C over a 30 minute period. The diffractometer is equipped with insulation so that whatever temperature stability is achieved in the area surrounding the apparatus is improved by a factor of 10 inside the apparatus. To maintain a more stable temperature around the diffractometer, NIST requires an insulated environmental chamber in which to place the diffractometer, equipped with air handling capabilities, as specified below. 

All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line items:
Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Environmental Chamber which shall meet or exceed the following required minimum specifications.  All equipment must be new. Refurbished and/or remanufactured shall not be considered.

The chamber shall have no floor; walls shall be sealed and anchored down to the existing concrete floor.  Chamber shall have one (1) 42" W 78" H door installed centrally on the front wall;

3. Temperature Control: 
The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber.  The Contractor shall provide a method whereby the temperature of the chamber can actively be controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be 0.05C or better. Preference will be given to greater sensitivity. 

The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The 
software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download.  The 
temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP.  

The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC><strong>The desciption is hereby modified in paragraph to change the Federal Acquisition Circular number from 05-32 to 05-38 (2 February 2010).<br /><br /></strong>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (2 FEBRUARY 2010)</strong></span></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span><strong>QUESTION 1:&nbsp;</strong> The Oxford 924 chipset is specified. Would it be acceptable to propose a solution using the Oxford 934 chipset which provides the same function and greater performance?<br /><br /><strong>ANSWER 1:</strong>&nbsp; As long as it meets the needs of the minimum specification (the Oxford 924 chipset), newer technology is acceptable.<br /><strong><br />QUESTION 2:</strong>&nbsp; The solicitation specifies a 3.5" HDD for all capacity models. For the 320GB, 500GB, and 750GB it would be possible to utilize 2.5" HDD's which would result in: (a) a significantly smaller package for those capaciities, while maintaining the same performance, and (b) allow for the unit to be powered by the computer or laptop without the need for an external power supply. Would such a solution be acceptable/desireable?<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 2:</strong>&nbsp;  The 3.5" HDD is the industry standard enclosure size. One of the benefits of having a consistent size is the ability to stack multiple drives. This proposed solution is not acceptable or desirable.<br /><strong><br />QUESTION 3:</strong>&nbsp; The current solicitation specifies USB 2.0 and USB 1.1. Would a solution with USB 3.0 be acceptable? USB 3.0 provides a 300% improvement in data transfer rate and is also backwards compatible with USB 1.1 and USB 2.0.<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 3:&nbsp;</strong> USB 3.0 is acceptable as it is backward compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1, but please keep in mind that all external hard drives must have a quad interface capability (USB, ESATA, FireWire400 and FireWire800).<br /><br /> <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

<DESC><strong>THE SOLICITATION IS HEREBY AMENDED:&nbsp; (2 FEBRUARY 2010)<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />The NAICS code listed in the solicitation remains the same.&nbsp; However, the size standard for that particular NAICS code is 500 (previously listed as 100).<br /><br /></span>QUESTION 1:&nbsp; </strong>We noticed that item 0005 listed (300) 1.5TB drives.

FSC: V231- Lodging- Hotel/Motel

This combined synopsis/solicitation is being ammended due to the reciept of non-conforming bids.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number H92257-10-Q-0002 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 200538 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20091229.  The proposed acquisition is restricted to total small businesses. The associated NAICS code is 721110 with a standard business size of $7.0M. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated.  Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure:  

CLIN 0001: Family Retreat (West Coast)
 
This requirement is for the services for the delivery of a Family Retreat on 24-27 June 2010. The following items listed here are required to support the Family Retreat: Lodging, Food (Catering), Meeting Room, Dinning Room and recreational activities (e.g. swimming pool, beach, canoeing, kayaking, horseback riding, etc.). The contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, materials, and administrative costs to support and perform these tasks according to the Statement of Work (SOW) attached. 

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are technical capability, delivery and price. The Government intends to make award based on best value. Best value means the expected outcome of the acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of offers, received.   Request that prospective bidders submit itemized bids with cost breakdowns to include lodging, meals and activities.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Senior Transition Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Act as OTI's in-country Start-Up Manager for limited periods of time for new country start-ups, or provide support while an OTI Country Representative is on leave, or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Washington, DC - based</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or his/her designee, the Transition Program Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC, including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups, ongoing OTI country programs and on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, participate in assessments for possible new country programs and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country team with new country start-ups, or provide support while the OTI Country Representative or Deputy Country Representative is on leave or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Support, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country Team in determining program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in conceptualizing and designing country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; When required by the OTI Country team, represent OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI team in identifying or seeking out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems and in providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Review program budgets and propose changes and adjustments and draft any written justifications that will assist in securing quick approvals;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the OTI Country team, update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the U.S. Department of State on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Program Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor, Worldwide position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>

<p>&bull; Act as OTI's in-country Start-Up Manager for limited periods of time for new country start-ups, or provide support while an OTI Country Representative is on leave, or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.

<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.</p>

<p>&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Advisor, worldwide position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or his/her designee, the Transition Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC, including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups, ongoing OTI country programs and on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, participate in assessments for possible new country programs and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country team with new country start-ups, or provide support while the OTI Country Representative or Deputy Country Representative is on leave or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Support, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI Country Team in determining program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in conceptualizing and designing country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy;</p>

<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; When required by the OTI Country team, represent OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the OTI team in identifying or seeking out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems and in providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Review program budgets and propose changes and adjustments and draft any written justifications that will assist in securing quick approvals;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the OTI Country team, update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the U.S. Department of State on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Transition Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.

The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO.

The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

(Depending on the date of contract award, these dates may be adjusted.) Working closely and collaboratively with the NCHS/NSFG work team to develop materials and specifications, the contractor shall conduct all the necessary activities, including sample design, pretest, CAPI programming, hiring, supervising and training interviewers, data processing, data file preparation, and data file documentation, for a complete national survey.

<p>The contractor shall conduct interviewing, data processing, and data file documentation for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Interviewing shall be conducted from mid-2011 to mid-2019, based upon approximately 5,000 completed interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age in the household population of the United States. In summary, the contractor shall perform the following tasks, working in close, continuing collaboration with the NCHS/NSFG staff:</p>
<p>(1) design a national sample that will yield about 5,000 interviews per year with men <br />and women 15-44 years of age for up to 8 years (mid-2011 through mid-2019), a total of about 40,000 interviews), with oversamples of Hispanic men and women, Black men and women, and males and females 15-19 years of age; <br />(2) program and test questionnaires for males and females; <br />(3) prepare advance letters, consent forms, and other survey field materials; <br />(4) recruit, hire, and train interviewers;<br />(5) conduct all interviews in person, typically in respondents' homes, collecting signed consent for the interview for all respondents, and signed parental consent for interviews with 15-17 year olds;<br />(6) achieve a 75% weighted response rate for both men and women;<br />(7) Use laptop computers to conduct the interviews, and send the (encrypted) data electronically to the contractor's central office as promptly as possible; <br />(8) Prepare 3 public use data files based on every 2-3 years of interviewing <br />(a public use file must be based on at least 12,000 interviews);<br />(9) Prepare Series 1 ("Plan and Operation") and Series 2 ("Sample Design, weighting, imputation, &amp; variance estimation") reports to describe the work that was done.<br />(10) Keep the data safe, secure, and confidential.</p>
<p>Thus, this contract will require the collection of a wide range of complex and sensitive data, in person, in English and Spanish, from national samples. The data must measure trends &amp; differences among the total population &amp; important sub-groups, with a response rate that gives its users confidence in the results, and at a cost that NCHS can afford. The contractor must also meet requirements for Certification and Accreditation for IT security under FISMA and other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Further information on the survey is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm.<br />Offerors are expected to be familiar with the contents of the web site and with Series 1, No. 48 ("Planning and Development of the continuous National Survey of Family Growth" and Series 2, No. 142 ("National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 6: Sample Design, Weighting, Imputation, and Variance Estimation.")

<DESC>Project Title: Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Custer, Gallatin, Helena & Lewis & Clark National Forests-Tree Planting

Project Location: Region 1, East Side Acquisition Zone; Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Custer, Gallatin, Helena & Lewis & Clark National Forests. 

The Forest Service is in need of tree planting services to restore and reforest lands that may have been burned over after wildfires or after timber harvest.  The purpose of this contract is to secure tree planting services that will ensure tree survival and growth.  Tree survival and growth is dependent on the initial health of the tree seedlings, the manner in which trees are handled and planted, environmental conditions such as soil moisture and weather, and animal damage to the seedlings. The services secured from this contract will include appropriate tree handling and planting techniques during periods of the year when environmental conditions are most favorable to ensure tree survival.

This is a notice to interested contractors* that the Forest Service intends to solicit for tree planting services on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge (B-DNF), Custer (CNF), Gallatin (GNF), Helena (HNF), and Lewis & Clark (L&CNF) National Forest lands, and an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with a base and two option years will result.  The successful Contractor(s) shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those supplies designated as Government furnished items), and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the areas specified in each Task Order.  The contract(s) will include tree preparation, handling, planting, shading, and tree transportation to provide the seedlings with the greatest chance of survival.  All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services shall be performed over the entire unit.

Snags and burned trees may be present in the planting units, creating a potentially hazardous condition and possibly resulting in blow-down and/or falling debris.  Such activity may increase with windy weather conditions.

Specific locations, maps and unit data pertaining to planting units for individual sub-items will be provided with each Task Order.  Spring and summer (if planned) tree planting seasons vary per geographic location, but performance periods may begin as early as mid-March and extend through July if planting is required in higher elevation areas.   Planting stock may include bareroot 2-0, 1-0, and 1-1s and container plugs of 160s, 160Ls, 91s, and 112s.  Other stock may be used and will be specified on the Task Order and Detailed Information Chart. Species planted may include ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Englemann spruce, lodgepole pine, western larch, and possibly a minor amount of white bark pine.  The number of acres to be planted per year for each Forest unit will likely vary.

Interested parties may contact Alane Fitzpatrick at the Helena National Forest, Supervisors Office (406) 495-3726.  The solicitation will be available on approximately 1 February 2010, and can be downloaded from this website at that time.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Novel Biometric Signatures
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-10-02
<RESPDATE>030410
<ARCHDATE>03022011
<CONTACT>Michael C. King, Program Manager, Email DNI-IARPA-RFI-10-02@ugov.gov
<DESC><strong>Synopsis</strong><br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.<br /><br /><strong>Background and Scope</strong><br />Since 9/11, the Intelligence Community's (IC) need for reliable biometric recognition performance has expanded beyond today's access control and verification applications that operate within tightly controlled conditions. The IARPA Smart Collection Office is seeking innovative ideas and concepts for the advancement of standoff biometrics technologies. IARPA's objective is to maintain a high degree of recognition accuracy (i.e. level of confidence associated with the match/non-match of biometric signatures derived from two distinct observations), while pushing the range of acquisition as far as possible and requiring minimal cooperation from the subject. The emphasis is on classifying and recognizing unique human phenomenology (i.e. anatomical, physiological, and/or behavioral), or novel biometric signatures, that may by acquired from significantly greater ranges than from today's commercially available biometrics technology. This could include new or unproven&nbsp; signatures, whose efficacy and potential are little understood, and which are not considered top tier biometric modalities. <br /><br />More specifically, IARPA is interested in novel biometric signatures that can be captured by non-contact methods; i.e., not involving immediate proximity to a sensor. Specific&nbsp; signatures that currently require close sensor proximity may be considered only if a reasonable technology development path exists to permit the acquisition of such signatures from significant ranges (i.e. in excess of 50 meters). While this RFI is not interested in addressing the fusion of biometric signatures, scientific approaches must include any techniques necessary to ensure signatures of interest are being derived from human sources. Also not of interest are techniques or technologies that exploit face, ocular (including iris), and voice or speech biometric modalities. <br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather input for an upcoming IARPA Workshop on Novel Biometric Signatures anticipated to take place on 31 March to 1 April 2010 in the Washington, DC Metro Area. The workshop objective is to understand the potential feasibility and limitations of novel biometric signatures. Participants will be selected primarily from respondents to this RFI. Workshop participation will be limited to US citizens and permanent US residents. This workshop seeks to accomplish the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Identify novel biometric signatures-the phenomenology corresponding to human processes/structures based on anatomical, physiological, and/or behavioral characteristics that may exhibit distinct features and are likely observable from significant ranges; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Explore non-traditional sensing methods-to include all aspects of transduction (i.e. emissive or modulation-based), propagation, and acquisition (may include techniques for distortion correction) of the signature(s) of interest from significant ranges.<br /><br />While the practical aspects of operations and deployment are not considerations at this stage, IARPA also seeks to understand the potential size, weight, and power characteristics of technologies being presented. It is expected that research efforts into these novel biometric signatures will ultimately provide new capabilities in human recognition that heretofore have not been feasible.<br /><br /><strong>Workshop Format</strong><br />It is anticipated that this upcoming two-day workshop will bring together researchers from diverse disciplines, including the biological sciences, computer science, physics, and engineering. As such, it presents unique opportunities for cross-disciplinary dialogue that address the unique challenges of potential signatures. The format will offer an opportunity for participants to educate both IARPA and one another in their disciplines and research, as well as provide a forum to facilitate the cross pollination of ideas.<br /><br /><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents</strong><br />IARPA invites respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and a rough estimated cost of the proposed approach. This<br />announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kit, or other materials are needed.<br /><br /><strong>Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.<br /></strong><br />Responses to this RFI have the following formatting requirements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The document should be formatted in 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-10-02 (This page is not included in the white paper page count);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary (This page is not included in&nbsp;the white paper page count);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas summary. (This page is not included in the white paper page count);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Five page white paper that includes the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Brief scientific discussion of specific signature(s), technology, or technique<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Predicted accuracy and stability of the phenomenology (i.e. signature)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Method(s) of acquisition<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Predicted acquisition time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.

A replacement change matrix is posted today which includes an addition to the RFP tab, lines 10-16.  Additionally, the GFP list posted February 1, 2010 unintentionally left page #9 blank.  The GFP list is reposted to remove the blank page (which changes the page count from 12 to 11).  Also, RFP Section J attachment #10 OSCOPTISIG Registration Form is attached.  All other documents for amendment 03 posted 1FEB10 remain the same.

<DESC>Amendment 3:

The E-6B Block II Modification Program consists of the Non-Recurring Engineering, Integration and Installation effort necessary to incorporate two systems into the E-6B Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) and into one E-6B Aircraft.  These systems are the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight Terminals (FAB-T) and the Multi-Role Tactical Common Data Link (MR-TCDL).

In December, 2009, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) was informed of a significant schedule slip on the Air Force FAB-T Program.  As NAVAIR is obtaining the FAB-T system from the Air Force and providing it as GFE under the Block II Program, it is now necessary to procure the Non-Recurring Engineering, Integration and Installation of the FAB-T and MR-TCDL Systems independently, so as to minimize the impact of the Air Force schedule slip on the Block II Program.  Procurement efforts for the MR-TCDL System will procede immediately, while efforts for the FAB-T System will not begin until FY12.

In June, 2009, NAVAIR synopsized the E-6B Block II requirement as a sole-source procurement based on the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The rationale supporting this authority no longer applies.  Accordingly, NAVAIR will pursue a competitively awarded Firm Fixed Price Contract.  

NAVAIR is revising Solicitation documents to reflect the changes above.  The current Solicitation documents, which have not been updated, will be posted to the NAVAIR website on or about the date of this posting.  The URL for the NAVAIR website is as follows:

http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm

NAVAIR anticipates that an updated draft Solicitation, not including Sections L and M, will be available on or about February 17, 2010.  NAVAIR anticipates that an official Solicitation will be available on or about May 4, 2010.  When additional Solicitation documents become available, they will be posted to the NAVAIR website at the URL above and amendments to this Synopsis will  likewise be posted.  The Government will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources.

NAVAIR intends to host an Industry Day for this requirement.  The date and location for Industry Day have not been determined at this time.  When the date and location for Industry Day have been determined, NAVAIR will post the date and location in an amendment to this Synopsis.

Please submit questions concerning this synopsis to Mr. Gregory S. Lee at gregory.lee@navy.mil, with a copy to Mr. David H. Dotson at david.h.dotson@navy.mil, IN WRITING.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.  Please file requests for contract documents with the appropriate agencies in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

<DESC>COMMAND AIR CREW TRAINING (CACT) PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND SIMULATOR TRAINING ON THE C-40A AIRCRAFT
PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Navy's Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program.  The following training courses are required:   Airframe/Power Plant Maintenance Training, Electrical/Avionics Maintenance Training, General Familiarization Maintenance Training, Aircraft Rigging Maintenance Training, Corrosion Control and Prevention Maintenance Training, Mobile Airframe/Power Plant Maintenance Training, Mobile Electrical/Avionics Maintenance Training, Mobile General Familiarization Maintenance Training, Mobile Aircraft Rigging Maintenance Training, Mobile Corrosion Control and Prevention Maintenance Training.  This effort includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities (excluding mobile course facilities as noted below), tools, training materials, training devices, administration, supervision and other services necessary for training for maintenance personnel of the Navy's C-40A (Boeing 737-700C Increased Gross Weight (IGW) configured for the U.S. Navy).  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein. The Navy must approve all course-training syllabi (Approved Training Syllabus (ATS)). The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  
 Instructors shall have an Airframe and Power Plant (A&P) License and demonstrated, practical knowledge and experience in the Boeing 737 next generation (NG) aircraft.  The A&P may be waived in cases where demonstrated, practical experience is extensive.  The contractor shall provide for all courses a Systems Familiarization Trainer/(SFT-low cost mockup) or equivalent higher order training device depicting cockpit and/or aircraft systems for trainee's to practice systems checks, identify equipment, observe aircraft system operations and review checklists.  The contractor shall provide for courses, where identified, a Maintenance Systems Training Device (MSTD) that depicts specific applications and/or aircraft systems (e.g., avionics, electrical).  The MSTD training device shall be an interactive trainer capable of student input and trainer system indications/ responses (action-reaction capability).  Maintenance Systems Training Device(s) (not a visual or motion simulator) training periods shall minimally include applicable safety and maintenance systems checks compliant to course ATA 104 level requirements.  Use of aircraft full flight simulators (used in training pilots) is not desired if use causes added cost value to the contract. Trainees must pass a course final exam.  

Training Locations:  Courses taught at a Contractor training site must be within 30 minutes of commercial lodging and eating establishments.  Training shall take place in an environmentally conducive, contractor facility for learning.  Additionally, upon request, Navy directed maintenance training shall be conducted at a Government specified site (mobile).  The Navy will provide an environmentally conducive classroom, chalk/marker board, projector screen, VCR and overhead projector for mobile maintenance courses.  Government site (mobile) maintenance course locations will be determined at the time of the requirement.  All training sites will be within the continent of the United States (not Hawaii or Alaska) and may be for one or more maintenance courses per trip.  Training device requirements for government site (mobile) courses shall be performed in a Navy provided C-40A aircraft or waived as a requirement.


NAVAIR Orlando seeks to competitively purchase these services via full and open competition.  For purposes of reporting business size, the applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 611512 with a size standard of $21.5 million.  A commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract is anticipated with a 20 month base period, three (3) 12-month option periods and one (1) 4-month option period.  The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers without discussions.  

Businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit literature, brochures, and capability summaries identifying, at a minimum, business size, socio/economic status and past and/or current performance (within past three years) on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact).

<p>04/17/09 - SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICEHAZARD RANKING SYSTEM AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST TECHNICAL SUPPORT This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR ? 121.104) possess the capability to support EPA?s Hazardous Ranking System (HRS) and National Priorities List (NPL) requirement. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government?s evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.). DESCRIPTION The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns for EPA?s Hazard Ranking System and National Priorities List Technical Support. EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able provide the technical and analytical services to provide support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA?s) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI) in assessing and implementing National Priorities List (NPL) activities. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), enacted on December 11, 1980, as amended, established broad authority for the Government to respond to problems posed by releases or threats of release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Responsibilities under CERCLA include: Section 104, Response Authorities; and Section 105, National Contingency Plan. CERCLA required the Federal Government to establish criteria for setting priorities among releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. EPA responded by developing the Hazard Ranking System (HRS), a scoring system which serves as the primary decision tool for determining which sites are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). The HRS evaluates four pathways of exposure: groundwater, surface water, soil exposure, and air. For each pathway, the HRS evaluates: (1) the likelihood of release to the media, (2) characteristics of waste (toxicity, quantity, etc.), and (3) targets (actual or potentially exposed receptors). Sites that score 28.5 or greater are eligible for placement on the NPL. The NPL is EPA?s list of priority hazardous waste sites. Sites on the NPL are eligible for Federal funding to perform remedial actions. For the purposes of this sources sought, the site assessment process consists of the evaluation and the placement of sites on the NPL. After discovery, the site is evaluated by the regions, States, or Federal agencies by a preliminary assessment (PA). A PA is an initial screening of the site in which all available data (e.g., past industrial activity, permit history, location of drinking water intakes) are collected and reviewed. If warranted by the PA, a site inspection (SI) is conducted. A SI involves on-site work that usually includes collection and analysis of suspected contaminated soil, surface water, groundwater, and air samples. In many instances, integrated assessments, which combine activities of the PA, SI, and removal assessment, are conducted at sites. If warranted by the SI, the site is formally evaluated for placement on the NPL. To determine an HRS score, all of the data gathered during the PA and SI stages are analyzed using the HRS. The HRS packages?documentation of the Agency's rationale, data, scoring procedures, overall score, and references?are prepared by the States, EPA regions, Headquarters contractor, and other participants in the NPL process. The packages are submitted through the regional EPA offices to OSRTI. The OSRTI NPL coordinator for each EPA region reviews the initial submission of a site package to ensure basic quality control standards are met. If they are, the HRS package is forwarded to the contractor to provide support by performing a detailed quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) review and analysis. After QA/QC reviews are completed, sites with an HRS score of 28.5 or greater are eligible for proposal to the NPL. For those sites determined to be appropriate for NPL listing, the HRS packages are placed in the Superfund docket for public review when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. Placing sites on the NPL is a two-stage process. First, sites are proposed to the NPL, and a 60-day comment period follows. The public comments on proposed sites are evaluated for technical accuracy and policy issues, and detailed responses are prepared. Second, following analysis and response to the public comments, sites still meeting the scoring criteria are placed on the NPL via a final rule. After a final rule, a period of 90 days is allowed for the public to file legal challenges to the Agency?s decision to place the sites on the final NPL. The Site Assessment and Remedy Decisions Branch (SARDB) in OSRTI is responsible for discovering sites, evaluating their potential threat to human health and the environment, implementing the HRS, proposing and adding them to the NPL and maintaining public information regarding these activities via the web and other OSRTI data systems. A key component of implementing the HRS is evaluating exposure pathways, including surface and groundwater contamination. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE) The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is:? 18,000 hours per year for a five (5) year contract? 18,000 hours per year for two (2) one (1) year award terms? 10,000 hours per year optional quantities ordered in increments for each year of the contract and each award term. (Maximum potential LOE of 28,000 hours per year, with a maximum potential seven (7) year LOE of 196,000 total hours) CAPABILITY STATEMENT: To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft SOW. The Government requests demonstration of capability by interested parties through submittal of capability statements. The government will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft SOW. All capability statements must: 1. Not exceed and will be restricted up to ten (10) single-sided pages in length.2. Be electronically submitted to the email address below by the stated deadline.3. Include small business classification(s): (Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.) 4. Address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to: (a) the key task areas in the draft SOW; and (b) the overall business demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules. 5. List references as well as demonstrate experience in conducting projects of similar size, scope, and complexity in the past 5 years.6. State the (a) average number of employees of the concern; (b) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; (c) other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.); and (d) a description of the concern?s accounting system for estimating and accumulating costs under cost-reimbursement contracts?and whether or not those system(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.7. Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability to meet the needs of the anticipated level of effort and scope of this requirement. Note that any resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting. The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive capability statements when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting RFP(s). The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps and EPA's website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm., under the ?Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) and Hazards Ranking System (HRS) Technical Support? link. All interested parties should check these sites frequently for updates. All information related to this procurement will be available at this link through the date of any award.

A SI involves on-site work that usually includes collection and analysis of suspected contaminated soil, surface water, groundwater, and air samples. In many instances, integrated assessments, which combine activities of the PA, SI, and removal assessment, are conducted at sites. If warranted by the SI, the site is formally evaluated for placement on the NPL. To determine an HRS score, all of the data gathered during the PA and SI stages are analyzed using the HRS. The HRS packages?documentation of the Agency's rationale, data, scoring procedures, overall score, and references?are prepared by the States, EPA regions, Headquarters contractor, and other participants in the NPL process. The packages are submitted through the regional EPA offices to OSRTI. The OSRTI NPL coordinator for each EPA region reviews the initial submission of a site package to ensure basic quality control standards are met. If they are, the HRS package is forwarded to the contractor to provide support by performing a detailed quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) review and analysis. After QA/QC reviews are completed, sites with an HRS score of 28.5 or greater are eligible for proposal to the NPL. For those sites determined to be appropriate for NPL listing, the HRS packages are placed in the Superfund docket for public review when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. Placing sites on the NPL is a two-stage process. First, sites are proposed to the NPL, and a 60-day comment period follows. The public comments on proposed sites are evaluated for technical accuracy and policy issues, and detailed responses are prepared. Second, following analysis and response to the public comments, sites still meeting the scoring criteria are placed on the NPL via a final rule. After a final rule, a period of 90 days is allowed for the public to file legal challenges to the Agency?s decision to place the sites on the final NPL. The Site Assessment and Remedy Decisions Branch (SARDB) in OSRTI is responsible for discovering sites, evaluating their potential threat to human health and the environment, implementing the HRS, proposing and adding them to the NPL and maintaining public information regarding these activities via the web and other OSRTI data systems. A key component of implementing the HRS is evaluating exposure pathways, including surface and groundwater contamination. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE) The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is:? 18,000 hours per year for a five (5) year contract? 18,000 hours per year for two (2) one (1) year award terms? 10,000 hours per year optional quantities ordered in increments for each year of the contract and each award term. (Maximum potential LOE of 28,000 hours per year, with a maximum potential seven (7) year LOE of 196,000 total hours) CAPABILITY STATEMENT: To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft SOW.

<DESC>The Statment of Work (SOW) was inadvertently left out of 10HQ23.  Statement of Work as follows:
PERFORMANCE BASED WORK STATEMENT
I.  GENERAL INFORMATION
A.  Introduction: Information on the amount and distribution of pesticide usage in the U.S., as well as seed trait information indicating the use of genetically modified crops, is needed in order for the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program to study the effects of pesticides on water quality. Among a variety of products, USGS produces summary tables of pesticide use for NAWQA study units and for the total U.S., maps that show the distribution of the estimated agricultural use of selected pesticides, and various models that relate estimated pesticide use to water quality. These tables, maps, and related products are made available to the public once the study has been completed and products have been approved.
B.  Background: In the past, USGS had relied on pesticide usage information produced by the National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy (NCFAP). However, NCFAP no longer produces this type of information. In addition, the information was at a State level, was not developed for each year, and had now reliability analysis, which greatly limited applications to data analysis. Recently, USGS has used a new source of pesticide use data that is provided for all 432 Crop Reporting Districts and is available on an annual basis with characterized reliability. 
II.    WORK REQUIREMENTS
A.Technical Requirements.      1.  Estimates of pesticide use and related parameters (see below) for 2008 and 2009.      2.  Estimated reliability of estimates by crop and Active Ingredients (AIs) for 2008 and 2009.      3.  The following information will be provided for 2008 and 2009:               a.  Data will be provided on a state and CRD (crop reporting district) level basis.              b.  Pesticide usage data on each of the 60 most extensive crops in the U.S., A cross reference data base                    of each of the 60 crops to Census of Agriculture crops              c.  Include all major AIs used on the 60 crops (approximately 320).              d.  Crop acres planted               e.  Annual application rate by AI and crop               f.  Percentage of acreage treated for each crop              g.  Total pounds AI by crop.              h.  Total area treated by crop.              i.  Application timing (expressed as a % of total pounds AI during a particular crop production phase).              j.  A GIS coverage of CRDs as well as a list of counties in each CRD will be provided.      4.  The following information will be provided for each year from 1998 through 2009:             a.Data will be provided on a state and CRD (crop reporting district) level basis.             b.Seed trait data for cotton, corn and soybeans, indicating types of seed and genetic traits and acreages.
B.  Data Reporting      1.  Data will be reported to the USGS in a .txt format and may include multiple files depending on the size of the            output generated.      2.

<DESC>VA-251-10-RQ-0074Questions and Answers2 February 2010Q. In section 2.2 the Price/Cost Schedule of the solicitation (page 6) it lists reupholstering as one of the requirements, however there isn't a line item for this service.  Would this be based on the laborer rate or is it to be included in the chair cleaning rate?A.  Reupholstering is based on the laborer rate.Q.  What are the ultimate criteria for picking a contractor to award the project to??A.  The award is based on price.Q. Who is/was the most recent contractor for this project last year?  Are they bidding again this year?A.  The contract is currently held by Work Squared out of Novi, MI.  It is not known if they are bidding or not.Q.  Do we have access to previous year's rejected bids??A.  No.Q.  While we will have an office set up just for this contract in MI, our finance office will still be in FL. Does the VA have any issue with that? Isn't the overall purpose that the contractor be able to handle VA concerns and needs quickly?A.  It is a requirement that the contractor's personnel be based within 150 miles of Ann Arbor. The winning bidder must be able to quickly respond to the needs of the VA as they arise.  However, the contractor must also keep in mind that there will be days that they are not needed and will not be paid.  It does not matter where the finance office is located.Q. Why isn't this a SDVO set-aside like so many other VA requirements?A.  The set-aside determination was made by the Contract Officer in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations. Q. What size truck is required to complete the daily task?A.  The size of truck is determined by the Contractor (It should depend on the job). There will be days that only labor is required and no truck will be needed.Q. Can you elaborate on what furniture and equipment will be moved?  I am assuming it is specific to collapsible cubicles and chairs but are there more items to be considered?A.  The equipment to be moved includes,  but is not limited to, Office Furniture (freestanding and modular), Medical Equipment, Household items (Refrigerators, Lounge Furniture), IT items (PC's, phones, copy machines), Safe's, Building Materials, Trash, Recycled Goods, Artwork  and Signage.  Q. There is a quote area for chair and cleaning and panel cleaning; is there any truly reupholstering involved or is the work specific to cleaning?  A.  There will be reupholstry work involved not specific to cleaning.  It is in addition to cleaning that is why it is listed as a separate line item.Q.  Is the expectation that cleaning is as need or is each piece to be cleaned after disassembly?A.  All items to be cleaned will be identified by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative before each job .Q.  Is mileage reimbursable or is that to be included in the cost of the truck?A.  It is included in the cost of the truck.Q.  Will we be responsible for any wiring connections/disconnections associated with the move or is this to be handled by an electrician from the VA?A.  The contractor shall make connections/disconnections for systems furniture. Building to furniture connections will be done by the VA.Q.  What size truck is required?  If this is not known then what is the average square footage moved each day or number of cubicles?A.  Size of truck is determined by the Contractor (It should depend on the job). There will be days that only labor is required and no truck will be needed.Q.  If we are to supply the toggles for connection can you provide the name of the manufacturer for the cubicles?  A.  The primary suppliers are Steel Case, Herman Miller and Hayworth.Q.  What equipment should the contractor have to perform the installations?A.  The contractor is responsible for supplying all the equipment and tools necessary to perform any tasking set out by the VA.  This includes (but is not limited to) several kinds of saws to cut work surfaces, wall track and other wood or metal office furnishings.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Alutiiq Global Solutions LLC, Task Order # W911S2-06-D-0006-0080<br><br>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is an order under an existing contract that was awarded using non-competitive procedures.<br><br>A task order modification was issed to remove the geofabric and gravel pads below the concrete bridge footers from the scope of work. These requirements are no longer needed due to the subsurface soils being sound enough to support the concrete footers for the bridge abutments. These soil conditions were not known at the time of project scoping, but were later determined sufficient upon excavation. The modification resulted in a CREDIT to the Government in the amount of $8,045.15.

<AWARDEE>FMR Consulting Inc., 7301 Oldham Leeds Way
, Springfield, MD 22150 US
<DESC>The Department of Education (the Department) required services for a financial advisor to provide general financial management services. Three main activities the contractor shall perform include 1) the production and analysis of audited financial statements, 2) assistance in the Department's financial management capacity related to credit reform activities, and 3) the performance of crucial account reconciliations. The Department obtained these services through a time and material delivery order awarded to FMR Consulting on January 31, 2009. <br />The purpose of this modification is to use ARRA funds to incrementally fund the delivery order with FMR Consulting for the above described tasks and reporting associated with the tasks. Currently, on a weekly basis, contractor assistance is needed to prepare the Financial Activity Report, which reports cumulative obligations and outlays or each ARRA appropriation by bureau/award type/place of performance. This report is submitted and posted to Recovery.gov. Assistance is also needed to validate the Funding Notification Report that is prepared weekly and submitted to Revcovery.gov. This report provides detail information regarding ARRA funding that has been made available. ARRA funding leads to increased complexity and additional analysis for the financial statements. ARRA funding also impacts the financial statements and notes by creating a new reporting group and additional disclosure requirements for the notes to the financial statements. It is because of these complexities and the unpredictability of the volume of work as it relates to ARRA funding that these funds cannot be linked to a fixed price task.<br />The initial delivery order was awarded as a time and materials type because the variables and details needed to develop a performance based statement of work was not and still is not known. The volume of ARRA actions is also an unknown. However, to preclude the future use of time and material type delivery orders for this requirement, the contractor will be given task instructions by the COR. These task instructions will then be compiled and used to better describe the tasks under this requirement. During the life of this delivery order, the contract specialist has asked the program office to collect the required technical information to develop a performance work statement that will allow the contracts office to compete this requirement on a firm fixed price basis in the future.<br />

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing sole source firm fixed price contract with Continental Flooring Company.  The period of performance for this award will be for one (1) base year and two (2) one-year option periods.  The requirement consists of acquiring Armstrong Acoustical Wall Panels.  The acoustical fabric style and color is only available from Continental Flooring Company.  No other style of color is acceptable to DOE Headquarters.
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1],  as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  Market research has revealed no other vendor with a Federal Supply Schedule on the GSA Advantage Web Site that can provide these acoustical panels.
This is a notice of intent and no solicitation is available for this requirement.
Interested parties may submit capability statement and rationale by February 12, 2010 via e-mail to kyle.martel@hq.doe.gov.  The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.
A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<AWARDEE>Luna Innovations Inc 1 Riverside Cir Ste 400 Roanoke VA 24016-4909
<DESC>SBIR/STTR Program - NASA needs compact nuclear reactors to power future bases onthe moon and Mars. These reactors require robust automatic control systems using lowmass, rapid response, in-core reactor power monitoring sensors and radiation tolerantsensor interrogation systems that do not yet exist. Luna proposes to develop a new typeof fiber optic miniature neutron flux and gamma flux sensor, which will havesignificantly faster response than recently developed fiber optic radiation sensors. Thenew sensors will maintain the advantages of current fiber optic reactor sensortechnology, including small size for in-core sensor distributions, high temperatureperformance (above 600oC), and immunity to electrical noise in the presence of ionizingradiation. During Phase I, Luna will demonstrate the feasibility of high-speed fiber optic gammaflux sensors in a nuclear reactor. Phase II will optimize the sensor design and theinterrogation system for high temperature in-core monitoring of both gamma flux andneutron flux with internal thermal compensation and in-situ thermal calibration. At theend of Phase II, Luna will deliver a lightweight sensor interrogation system, utilizingexperimentally verified radiation hardened components wherever possible, and including ananalog output signal for interfacing with standard reactor control electronics. &lt;P&gt;

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ04UA00007.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to the Education and Training Resources (ETR) under contract number DOLJ04UA00007.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $214,888 to the Turner Job Corps Center, operated by Education and Training Resources.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for CRA, Equipment and CTST on this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:  1) CTT auto and construction curriculum; 2) address CRA HVAC and plumbing deficiencies; 3) Career Technical Skills Training pertaining to Green Initiative projects; and 4) to be directed to electric and electric hybrid vehicles for operation on Turner Job Corps center. These funds may be used for all expenses related to the acquisition of electric vehicles, including purchase of vehicles, shipping and delivery costs, training on use of vehicle, and additional equipment such as batteries and supplies. In addition, Job Corps centers with automotive career technical training (CTT) programs will use this opportunity to acquire electric hybrid vehicles as student training aids, to provide hands-on technical training in green vehicle technologies. 

This Modification has been awarded on January 29, 2010.
