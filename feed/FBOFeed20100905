<a href="mailto:ronald.heidemann@va.gov">Contracting-Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The VISN 10 Contracting Activity intends to negotiate a sole source contract with HAAS Group International Inc. to purchase one (1) web based consolidated hazardous chemical and materials program (MAXCOM). The procurement will be for the Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC and the Columbus VAACC. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541519 and the Small Business Standard is $25 MIL and the Government believes that HAAS Group International Inc. is the only manufacture that can satisfy the agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to proceed with a sole source procurement for the required supplies and or services. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 - only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. To the best of our knowledge, HAAS Group International Inc., West Chester, PA is the only source that provides the above indicated items and features. This is a notice of intent to sole source and is not a request for competitive quotes. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer by close of business 09-10-2010. Telephone and facsimile requests/inquiries will not be accepted. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at ronald.heidemann@va.gov. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Cincinnati VA Medical Center will precede with the sole source negotiation with HAAS Group International Inc. West Chester, PA.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division (NCD), New England Soldier Support and Individual Equipment (NESSIE) has a requirement for 1,657 brass Quick Disconnects (QD) and 1,657 brass Quick Disconnect Adapters (QDA). The QD is used to attach the medium pressure oxygen delivery system under spring tension to the Parachutist Oxygen Mask (POM), the Bailout Bottle system, and 6-man Oxygen console, allowing for positive connection and quick doffing capability. The QD is made of non-sparking material and is compatible with the swivel T and reducer regulator on the POM in use by the U.S. Army Airborne community. The QDA is a brass flared union which fits onto the QD, allowing it to attach to the Bailout Bottles and oxygen delivery hose for the 6-man Oxygen console. Due to the sensitive nature of oxygen operations, these items are both highly specialized and must be oxygen clean. The NAICS code for this requirement is 336413. This acquisition will be conducted using simplified acquisition processes in accordance with the procedures found at FAR 13.5. The Government is aware of a limited number of sources for these items as they are highly specialized in nature and considered life-critical items based upon their use in High Altitude, High Opening (HAHO) parachutist operations. Comments concerning this acquisition may be sent to the Contract Specialist, Mark.Marchioli@us.army.mil. This synopsis expires 10 September 2010 at 1200 EST.

It is intended that this procurement will be sole source per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (3) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3) & FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center.

A Veterans Health Administration (VHA) initiative is redesigning primary care around the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Model, a patient-driven, team-based approach that delivers efficient, comprehensive and continuous care through active communication and coordination of healthcare services.   Most VHA Primary Care practices have already adopted many features of patient centered care and the medical home, but complete achievement will involve strategic assessment and redeployment of resources, realignment of priorities, and a cultural shift.  This effort will be transformative and will align VA with national health care reform initiatives, enable us to continue to provide leadership in health care delivery, and assure that our Veterans' health continues to be managed with the highest quality, safety and effectiveness.   
This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government in the future. Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this requirement and considered for future reference. All information submitted should support the capability to provide the services needed, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation indicating a bona fide capability to provide the required service. Responses may be submitted via email to Ross.Byrne@va.gov no later than 10 September 2010.
