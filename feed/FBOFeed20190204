<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

SOLICITATION NUMBER: N4008519R9022

This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this synopsis is to make notice of a proposed contract action for P-310 Dry Dock #1 Super Flood Basin and P-1074 Extend Portal Crane at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This solicitation will result in a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract for design-bid-build (DBB) construction services. This project provides various upgrades to Dry Dock #1, and Berths 1, 2, and 11 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) as part of the shipyards effort to meet mission requirements and return vessels to the naval fleet.
The proposed upgrades are divided into two separate projects: P-310 and P-1074. 

The P310 upgrades include the construction of a super flood basin at the entrance to Dry Dock #1. This project includes: constructing a basin closure wall with entrance structure and caisson seat and repurposing the existing Dry Dock #3 caisson gate; extending the Flatiron Pier (Berths 1 and 2) to the new closure wall; increasing the height of the basin wall at Berth 1; installing steel sheeting in front of Berth 1 to prevent water exfiltration; dredging the area in front of Berth 1; and installing water-tight enclosures around each of the service galleries inside Dry Dock #1. In addition, new portal crane rail will be installed along Berths 1 and 2, which will include a portal crane maintenance and testing area.
Fender panels will be added to Berth 2.

P-1074 involves upgrades to the portal crane rail and the addition of train rail, as well as upgrades to existing utilities. Specifically, this project includes: providing new portal crane rail for heavy lift access to the Dry Dock Complex (this will require grade changes, a retaining wall, and site layout adjustments); increasing the load capacity of the existing portal crane rail foundations at Dry Dock #1 and the turnout to Berth 11; adding a new train rail spur from Berth 1 to the  Dry Dock Complex; providing a new access tunnel under the existing crane rail foundations between Dry Dock #1 and the Dry Dock Complex; providing various electrical upgrades, such as crane heater circuits, industrial power, and area lighting; adding a substation, transformer, and secondary substation in the Berth 2 shore power substation, as well as necessary electrical distribution feeds; providing a communication system between the Dry Dock Complex and Dry Dock #1; and providing pure water piping from the Dry Dock Complex to the planned pure water pad.

The completion time for this contract is 850 calendar days after award.
This solicitation is being advertised as Unrestricted for full and open competition.
This is a one phase source selection procurement requiring both non-price (technical and past performance) and price proposals, and will utilize the best value continuum process at FAR 15.101-1, tradeoff.  The basis for evaluation and evaluation factors for award will be included in the solicitation.  Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.

The appropriate Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 237990  Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, and the Small Business Size Standard is $36,500,000.  In accordance with DFARS 236.204, the magnitude of construction for this project is between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000.
This office anticipates award of a contract for these services by 19 July 2019.

A Sources Sought notice was issued on 23 October 2018 to determine the capability of small businesses to perform the requirement.  The Sources Sought notice yielded no responses.  Based upon analysis of the data considered, and in accordance with FAR 19.501(c), the Contracting Officer has determined that there is not a reasonable expectation that an adequate number of Small Business firms would respond to or be qualified to perform the requirements of this solicitation.  NAVFAC Mid-Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurred with this decision on 04 December 2018.

The drawings and specifications for this project will be posted with the solicitation and are not available at this time.
 The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 19 February 2019.  All documents will be in Adobe PDF file format and downloadable from the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website.  The official address to the solicitation is https://www.neco.navy.mil.  Contractors are encouraged to register for the solicitation when downloading from the website.  Only registered contractors will be notified by email when amendments to the solicitation are issued.  A free Acrobat Reader, required to view the PDF files, can be downloaded from the Adobe website. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All prospective offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).  You must have an active registration in SAM to do business with the federal government.
 For additional information, go to https://www.sam.gov.

Questions regarding this notice should be directed to John Bishop at john.p.bishop1@navy.mil.

<a href="mailto:erwin.c.cablay@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-19-R-0036. The Afloat Network Design and Architecture Code 55130 and Network Test and Integration Code 55190 at Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) SSC Pacific has identified a requirement for engineering, technical and programmatic services for networking, communication, and computer systems, and associated certification and information assurance for developments, current operations and planned upgrades to support Program Management Warfare (PMW) 160 Tactical Networks. The networking, communication and computer systems described and referred to in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) are specialized tactical systems fielded through various Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) Programs of Record (POR) baselines and variants, that enable Command and Control (C2) in naval, joint, coalition operations, providing the gateway to achieving Information Warfare Dominance in the cyberspace domain.
Under SSC Pacific Transport and Computing Infrastructure (TCI) Portfolio construct, SSC Pacific Codes 55130 and 55190 anticipates work that will include the Ashore, Afloat, Subsurface, Airborne, Mobile, and Joint domains with specific technologies such as network design and development, network monitoring, management and operations, common computing environment, infrastructure with associated hardware and software components, cloud computing, ashore and afloat data centers and server hosting environments, consolidated network enterprise services, wireless networking, cybersecurity engineering, software engineering and automation, and tactical and satellite communications. Transformation of capabilities-based portfolio into a networked and computer infrastructure enables Information Warfare Dominance through Navy and Joint net-centric operations.
The anticipated action will be a single award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) pricing Contract Line Items Number (CLIN) for services, cost reimbursement CLINs for materials and other direct costs (inclusive of travel). No fee will be allowed under the cost reimbursement CLINs. The period of performance will include a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The total estimated level of effort is 689,020 hours. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 Engineering Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5 million. The security requirement for this tasking will be up to and including Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information. The work performed by the Contractor will include access to unclassified and up to Top Secret/SCI data, information, meetings, and spaces.
For this requirement, a market survey to determine small business capability was posted on SPAWAR e-Commerce Central on 22 January 2018. Based on the evaluations of the responses to the market survey, SSC Pacific intends to compete the requirement as full and open competition. The requirement is described in the PWS. SSC Pacific Small Business Office (SBO) concurs with the acquisition strategy decision.
THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT (PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT) PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO THE SOLICITATION. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for items quoted.

**See attached STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)


ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as set-aside for Small Business.  The applicable NAICS code is 339112.  The solicitation will be issued on or about February 6, 2019 for approximately seven (7) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND nicholas.kyriakidis@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders certify they are not providing grey market items and must either provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment or written and signed statement that says the vendor certifies they are not providing gray market items.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND nicholas.kyriakidis@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<p>The Evolved Strategic SATCOM (ESS) program is the follow-on to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Satellite program and will be the next generation of protected communication satellites. ESS is interested in the possible development of new space-qualified communications payload End Cryptographic Units (ECUs). ECUs may require new ESS specific algorithms as will be prescribed by the National Security Agency. <br />SMC/MC is considering separating the acquisition of the ESS payload ECUs from the remainder of the ESS program. The Space Payload ESS ECU Development (SPEED) team would procure NSA certified ECUs that would be furnished as Government equipment to the Payload developers of the larger ESS space vehicle program.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>NCATS performs numerous liquid dispensing high-throughput assays annually within the various laboratories at the center. NCATS tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen that enables compound bioactivity assessment and probe production efficiency, thus allowing staff to make more informed decisions on which scaffolds to pursue for probe development. NCATS collaborates with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define new biology, reflected in reaching potential new investigators producing new scientific endeavors. NCATS is focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of probe development, typified by qHTS, informatics platforms, utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, and the development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms. Discoveries about the molecular basis of disease provide unprecedented opportunities to translate research findings into new medicines.

That solicitation number is W91QVP-19-Q-6500 and was awarded under contract number W91QVP-19-P-6500 on 02 Jan 2019. The contract was issued for $179,225.00 and was for the lease of tents on a firm fixed prices basis with the intent to modify the contract if more tent space was required. Due to a rapid influx of personnel the tent space has grown to accommodate the actual number of people. When the new requirement came in, the tents were already being built on Ft. Irwin. It's logical and more cost effective to have the current contractor perform the services. The current contract (W91QVP19P6500P00003) will expire on March 06, 2019 and a new solicitation will be issued on a competitive basis to establish new contracts when future tent space is required on Ft. Irwin. The contracts&nbsp;current total value&nbsp;is $499,530.00 and the modfication was awarded to the incumbent, EXCLUSIVE TENT RENTALS, INC. Address; 1884 LIVE OAK WAY, Upland California. This notice for a contract modification is being posted in accordance with FAR 5.201. Any inquires to this notice must be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer; Charles Cryoskie at charles.a.cryoskie.mil@mail.mil. Any responses are due by Friday, Feb 8, 2019 11:00 a.m. PST. </span>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>I. Background</strong></p>
<p>Technology transfer has been a critical focus for NASA since the agency was established sixty years ago. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 mandated that NASA disseminate information about its research activities and ensure that technologies created for space exploration be made available to benefit all mankind. NASA's Technology Transfer Program strives to achieve this objective by identifying, protecting, and transferring the Agency's intellectual property (IP).</p>
<p>NASA's Technology Transfer Program is Agency-wide and supports offices at each of NASA's ten (10) Field Centers. Each Field Center generates new technology, assesses commercial viability of the technologies and then pursues technology transfer opportunities, such as patent licensing. While this method is effective, the Agency is looking for cost effective ways to work in a more coordinated, judicious and strategic manner to protect this intellectual property for the purposes of technology transfer and maintaining a robust portfolio of licensed and licensable technologies.</p>
<p>When a New Technology Report (NTR) is submitted by a researcher at a NASA Field Center, the NTR is evaluated to determine if the new technology has any commercial value. With rising patent costs and tightening budgets, NASA only files patents on technology deemed commercially viable. After a favorable commercial assessment, NASA will file for patent protection.</p>
<p>The patents owned by NASA cover a broad spectrum of technologies relevant to NASA's mission and as such, represent the full breadth and scope of the work performed by the Agency. The Field Center's Technology Transfer office works to market and license the technologies for commercial application.</p>
<p>The Agency's patent licensing program is overseen at NASA Headquarters (HQ), but licenses are negotiated and managed by Technology Transfer offices at each of the 10 Field Centers. NASA Field Center Directors are delegated the authority to enter into patent license agreements.</p>
<p>NASA currently has multiple vendors and processes for assessing commercial potential, the result of which is inconsistency in results, difficulties in cost controls, and a lack of strategic coordination. NASA is seeking to strengthen this core technology transfer function across the Agency by centralizing the assessments of its new technologies for commercial potential and detailed market analysis for the existing portfolio.</p>
<p>Specifically, NASA is exploring the possibility of engaging one Contractor to manage the initial evaluation of New Technology Reports submitted from researchers at all NASA Field Centers and conducting market assessments for existing patents. This centralized approach may assist in facilitating better communication about the inventions being developed across the Agency and establishing a better understanding of how NASA's IP is being captured by each Field Center, enable NASA to strategically acquire and manage its IP, and increase the effectiveness of NASA's technology transfer efforts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">II. Request for Information</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.</strong> Respondents are encouraged to respond to each question and to present their answers after each question. The following questions address the primary areas about which NASA seeks comments. Respondents may organize their submissions in response to this RFI in any manner. Responses may include estimates, which should be identified as such.</p>
<p>All responses that comply with the requirements listed in the DATES and ADDRESS sections of this RFI will be considered.</p>
<p>NASA is interested in receiving responses to the following questions from the stakeholder community:</p>
<p>1.) Please provide brief background information on the nature of your organization's business and business operations. Please include your organization's capabilities and strengths, particularly regarding evaluation, management, and marketing of intellectual property.</p>
<p>2.) What are the types of services that your organization might be interested in providing to NASA including, but not limited to: performing a comprehensive evaluation for new technologies, both patented and unpatented; evaluating the commercial landscape for early-stage technologies and determining whether or not to pursue patent protection; market assessment of NASA-owned patents and other intellectual property; mining NASA's patent portfolio to identify patent bundles; valuation of NASA's patent portfolio; and any other services the Respondent deems appropriate to achieve NASA's goal of assessing its intellectual property portfolio in order to increase technology transfer to the public.</p>
<p>3.) Please provide a summary of the resources that your organization could provide to NASA as part of a potential service, including networks, the background and experience of personnel, and any facilities, equipment, or other assets that may be used to support NASA's Mission.</p>
<p>4.) Given that NASA's technology portfolio is divided across ten NASA Field Centers, how would your organization identify and evaluate technologies across multiple Field Centers and/or third-party organizations (e.g. academic affiliates)? Please characterize the amount of information and support that would be required from NASA staff in order to conduct such an evaluation.</p>
<p>5.) NASA receives approximately 300 New Technology Reports (NTRs) from all ten Field Centers annually. How would your organization evaluate the technologies disclosed in NTRs and determine whether or not to recommend pursuing patent protection? Specifically, what evaluation criteria would you review when performing comprehensive valuation of these new technologies?</p>
<p>6.) What variety of methods would your organization use to aid NASA assessing the market value of its existing IP portfolio? How would your organization help NASA identify potentially interested parties? Please provide details about your experience to date with each of the methods your organization would use, as well as some illustrative examples of each.</p>
<p>7.) How does your organization measure success? Specifically, what metrics would be used to demonstrate success? Please provide details about the success rates your organization has had with each of the methods described above.</p>
<p>8.) Has your organization ever provided similar services to any Federal Government Agencies? If so, please provide details about relevant experiences, your methods for complying with relevant Federal regulations and policies, and identify the Agencies and the points of contact.</p>
<p>9.) If you were advising the U.S. Government, what approach would you recommend using to assure that the U.S. Government's IP finds the widest dissemination possible for the benefit of the public and U.S. economy? How would you improve the transfer of technology, knowledge, and capabilities resulting from Federal R&amp;D to benefit innovation?</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.</p>
<p>In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2) Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>
<p>(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br /><br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br /><br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. (c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d) Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties. 3</p>
<p>(e) Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial<br />action;<br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or<br />6. Other appropriate action. <br />(End of contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-70 Contractor Communications</p>
<p>(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.</p>
<p>(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.</p>
<p>(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on February 15, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Diana Romero. The E-mail address is Diana.Romero@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Diana Romero, (303) 497-3761, E-email address is diana.romero@noaa.gov .</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, and Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ), and is posted as unrestricted open market. The Department of Veteran Affairs Northern California Healthcare System is intending to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract as a result of this combined notice.  

Evaluation:
Award will be based on simplified evaluation procedure using a comparative evaluation of qualified quotes received in response to this combined notice for determining which offer is of best value to the Government for meeting the requirements of the statement of work as stated herein. Qualified offers are required to be licensed in the State of California for providing armored car services.  Any anticipated fees or surcharges need to be included in the firm fixed prices quoted in the table provided.   

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101, dated 10-26-2018.

Evaluation of Options:
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation.  Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price.
Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
   (NOTE: Offeror is NOT to quote on the Option to Extend Services)

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p>Position Information: 	Two full-time, Personal Services Contractors (PSCs): Associate-Director-level and/or Director-level.<br /> One Base year (2,087 hours per year), renewable for up to 4 Option years at the sole discretion of the government (a total of 10,435 hours over five years).</p>
<p>Pay Band:	Associate-Director-level Pay Band 3B ($39.77 - $72.02 per hour) or Director-level Pay Band 3A ($55.10 - $82.46 per hour)<br /> https://www.mcc.gov/careers/pay-bands<br /> The PSCs may receive a pay supplement of up to 15% of the employee's direct labor cost in lieu of fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Closing Date for Questions:	2:00PM ET on 12 February 2019 (Tuesday)<br /> Questions must be submitted via email to leeae@mcc.gov</p>
<p>Submission Deadline:	5:00PM ET on 21 February 2019 (Thursday)<br /> Quotes must be submitted via email to leeae@mcc.gov</p>
<p>Position Security Level:	Secret Clearance (Noncritical Sensitive/Moderate Risk (T-3))</p>
<p>Who May Be Considered:	U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Duty Location:	Performance in Washington, DC USA.</p>
<p>Set Aside:	This requirement is set-aside for individuals (small business concerns) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with a size standard of $15,000,000 in revenue. The award will be considered for individuals that satisfy this set-aside, not for firms.</p>
<p>Type of Contract:	Time-and-material (T&amp;M) with 1 Base Year and 4 Option Year Periods.</p>
<p>Multiple awards may result from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Submission and Award:	The Government intends to award one Associate Director PSC and one Director PSC, two Associate Director PSCs, or two Director PSCs. The Government will evaluate the received quotes on the first week of each month (the first round of evaluation will occur the first week of January 2019). The Government intends to extend this RFQ until either or both positions are filled. MCC may close the RFQ once qualified PSCs are selected. Offerors are permitted to apply to either Associate-Director-level or Director-level position or both levels (if qualified for both positions) for MCC's consideration. An offeror cannot fill both positions however; MCC will award each award to an individual.</p>
<p>Amendment 1:	The purpose of Amendment is (1) to answer questions by interested offerors and (2) to clarify the submission deadline. Due to the US Federal Government lapse in FY2019 Appropriations, MCC will shut down starting 3 January 2018 and thus the submission deadline may be affected. MCC's intent is for the quote submissions to be due by 5:00PM ET on 24 January 2019 (Thursday); however if MCC is unable to timely address the questions (due by 2:00PM ET on 8 January 2019), then MCC may consider extending the submission deadline.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, MCC will not be allowed to work during the furlough period (or also called "shutdown"). MCC will not be able to make amendments to this RFQ until the US Federal Government reopens. Please check this RFQ on FBO.gov after the US Federal Government reopens. If MCC decides to extend the submission deadline, MCC will amend this RFQ within 5 business days from the reopening date. Unless this RFQ is amended, interested offerors shall assume that the questions and the quote submissions deadlines remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The interested offerors are responsible for staying updated on the current US Government furlough/shutdown status and submit your quotes timely. Please read the US news and https://www.opm.gov/ regarding furlough/shutdown information.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>1. Will MCC consider offerors who are not US Citizens?<br />A: No, MCC cannot consider offerors who are not US Citizens. This is a MCC Security requirement to allow MCC to conduct a complete background check on the offerors.</p>
<p>2. Will MCC permit full-time telework?<br />A: No, the duty station for this PSC will be Washington, DC. These positions require administering contracts as well as domestic and international travel, which would make the logistics difficult and expensive for MCC.</p>
<p>Amendment 2:	The purpose of Amendment is (1) to answer questions by interested offerors and (2) to establish the dates for the next cycle of questions and quotes. The next cycle of questions are now due by 2:00pm ET on 12 February 2019 (Tuesday) and quotes are now due by 5:00pm ET on 21 February 2019 (Thursday). The next round of evaluation will occur around the week of 4 March 2019.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>1. Please explain the evaluation process that takes place the first week of each month starting with January 2019; the proposal is due on January 24, 2019; how can there be an evaluation the first week in January 2019?<br />A: The intent of the Government is to receive quotes and evaluate on monthly basis. Quotes received by 31 December 2018 would have been evaluated around the first week of January; quotes received by 24 January 2019 would be evaluated around the first week of February; quotes received by the new deadline (21 February 2019) would be evaluated around the first week of March; so forth. However, we did not receive any quotes in December so no evaluation occurred in early January.</p>
<p>MCC plans to accept quotes until a qualified candidate has been identified. Once identify, MCC will issue an amendment to notify the last day of quote submission for each of two positions. There is no advantage in applying sooner. Every candidate will be evaluated and considered equally until this solicitation is closed.</p>
<p>2. If applying for both positions must you submit two separate proposals?<br />A: Preferably, yes. Or the candidate may clearly demonstrate that she/he fulfills the qualifications for both levels (Associate Director and Director) and note that she/he hopes to be considered for both positions. However, note that each award will be made to separate individuals (an individual cannot win both awards).</p>
<p>3. The RFP states no full time telework will be authorized; will telework be authorized on this contract for other than full time work performance?<br />A: Part-time telework is not guaranteed but it may be permitted on the sole discretion of MCC.</p>
<p>Amendment 3:	The purpose of Amendment is to (1) to correct/clarify the Type of Contract and (2) to clarify a few points regarding this position.</p>
<p>The contract type will be T&amp;M with 1 Base + 4 Option Years (5 years total).</p>
<p>MCC may award one Associate Director and one Director, two Associate Directors, or two Directors. MCC may also decide to award more than two Full-Time PSCs. Part-time PSCs will not be considered.</p>
<p>MCC does not pay any insurance on behalf of the PSC.</p>
<p>Any material changes from the previous RFQ Amendment are highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>Our model is defined by principles of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results. Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. MCC's values are CLEAR - Collaboration, Learning, Excellence, Accountability and Respect. We recruit staff that will embody and uphold these values.</p>
<p>This position is located on the Program Procurement Practice Group, Sector Operations Division within the Department of Compact Operations. The Program Procurement Practice Group oversees the procurement activities required to implement an MCC-funded Compact.

<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contract:<br />(1)	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />(2)	Principal tools and equipment may be furnished by the Government.<br />(3)	Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.<br />(4)	Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.<br />(5)	The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.<br />(6)	The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to-<br />(i)	Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii)	Retain control of the function involved; or<br />(iii)	Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>4.	Key Requirements</p>
<p>Awardee must satisfy the following key requirements:<br />&bull;	U.S. citizenship.<br />&bull;	Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull;	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />&bull;	Domestic and international travel will be required.<br />&bull;	Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (e.g., Office of Government Ethics "OGE Form-450" or similar statement) may be required.<br />&bull;	Active System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) registration (this is a free, Government website) and be listed as sole-proprietor.<br />&bull;	Designated and/or random drug testing required.</p>

<p>e)	Complexity</p>
<p>The work is characterized by breadth of planning, review, and coordination or depth of problem identification and analysis, stemming from the variety of the procurement functions or from unknown changes or conflicts inherent in the issues.

The majority of the contacts will be located in the MCA country outside the US.</p>

<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR.

<DESC>The combined synopsis solicitation 36C10E19Q0046 0005 is amended as follows.
The following is to answer a vendor question and to extend the closing date to 02-18-2019 at 5:00 PM Central Standard Time.
1-Question:  Regarding the environmental portion of the bid, how does government expect to achieve clearance levels of 40 for lead in the area if the concrete is not sealed? Will it need to be sealed as part of the scope of work?  Note that right now the SOW just states broom clean.
1-Answer: We are not asking the contractors to do a massive cleaning or seal the surfaces. We are requiring that the dust generated from the work activity be controlled and isolated to the work area. The highest levels of lead from previous wipe sampling were found on the top of one shelf. This was an area that was not part of routine housekeeping. We need to ensure that the project did not adversely affect the area by generatingdust. If the work activities were adequately controlled and the work area was isolated, there should not be an increase in the dust levels. 
The contractor will need to meet a criterion for re-occupancy of the space. In lieu of the normal clearance criteria, GSA will collect background samples from horizontal surfaces within the work area (interior areas only) before the work begins and then collect post-project samples in the same locations after the final cleaning. The levels will be compared and if the post-project samples are as low or lower than the background samples, then the area has been cleared and re-occupancy can occur. If this criterion is not met, additional cleaning will be necessary. 
Cleaning should not be done with a broom, but with lead-safe work practices, such with a vacuum with HEPA filtration or wipes with D-Lead or equivalent. Keep in mind that the contractor must perform their own personal sampling of their employees as per the OSHA Lead in Construction standard (29 CFR 1926.62) in order to determine the appropriate PPE for the employees. 
The new samples will be collected on Tuesday Feb 5, 2019 by GSA and will be provided to contractors via the contracting officer on Friday Feb 8, 2019 as an RFQ amendment.
Based on the above new information, the solicitation close date is extended to 02-18-2019 to allow more time for contractors to submit quotes.
There are no other changes.

<p>The purpose of this RFI is to release the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) in order to allow industry the opportunity to review and submit questions ahead of the formal Request for Proposal tentatively planned for release during the 2Q of FY2019.

The Government will not privately respond to any comments received.</p>
<p><br />7. DISCLAIMER: Request for Information: PMO SBCT <br /><br />This RFI is for informational purposes only. The information in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This is not a request for proposal, does not constitute a solicitation, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to purchase enhancements, hardware or services for the Stryker FoV. Responses in any form are not considered offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. Funds are NOT available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p>Proprietary Information. The United States Government (USG) acknowledges its obligations under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905) to protect confidential information provided to the Government. Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept any trade secrets or proprietary restrictions placed upon data presented in response to this survey and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified on what data is proprietary.</p>
<p>&bull; Mark only data that is truly confidential.</p>
<p>&bull; Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in possession of the USG or third parties on an unclassified basis. Do not submit any classified data in response to this market survey.</p>
<p>&bull; Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail as well as at the beginning of the file. Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends: "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The Government is not responsible for the public disclosure of unmarked data received in response to this market survey. Accordingly, the potential offeror shall ensure that technical data provided in response to this market survey shall be appropriately marked (i.e. proprietary) to ensure proper Government handling of the data. Should the USG need to reproduce the protected data for distribution purposes between Governments offices, all such data shall be reproduced with restrictive legends in place.</p>

Whether your atherectomy goal is to maximize luminal gain, create in-line flow, target eccentric or circumferential disease. ONE DEVICE FOR ABOVE &amp; BELOW THE KNEE  Now available in 6F, the HawkOne  device is the newest addition to Medtronic s directional atherectomy portfolio, which restores blood flow by removing plaque from blocked arteries in the lower extremities. The design enhancements of the HawkOne platform plus the new 6F size simplify device selection for physicians who treat above and below the knee. TREAT ALL MORPHOLOGIES The HawkOne  device allows physicians to treat all morphologies, including severe calcium.  The directional cutting design is consistent and predictable, with no increase in cut depth  Device pushability and torqueability offers control through challenging lesions TREAT WITH PROCEDURAL EFFICIENCY  Cleaning time is faster with preloaded distal flush tool  No capital equipment provides easy set up Turbo Hawk:  The TurboHawk  plaque excision system treats peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by removing plaque from blocked arteries. The TurboHawk device is available in a High Efficiency (HE) Cutter to tackle the toughest lesion morphologies, including calcium,* and a Smooth Cutter to treat mild to moderately calcified lesions. Now you can treat PAD with technology that maximizes lumen gain, preserves a patient s native vessels, and keeps future treatment options open. Silver Hawk: SilverHawk technology uses a tiny rotating blade that shaves and removes plaque from the vessel lumen, thereby enhancing luminal gain. By removing plaque, the SilverHawk device creates an open channel for adequate blood flow without stretching the vessel. No capital equipment is needed to operate the SilverHawk system so set-up time is minimal. The SilverHawk Plaque Excision System from Covidien treats peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by removing plaque buildup in the arteries of the leg. SilverHawk technology incorporates use of a tiny rotating blade that shaves plaque from the vessel lumen, thereby enhancing luminal gain, and removes plaque from the body. Directional atherectomy with the SilverHawk device enables physicians to maximize lumen gain and minimize barotrauma without leaving any implant behind.

<DESC><strong>Purpose of this Amendment:</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong><strong></strong>
<p><strong>Modify the planned release date for this BAA to February 7, 2019, and provide notification of an Industry Forum on February 14, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>NASA intends to release a solicitation under the second Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on <strong>February 7, 2019</strong>, to seek proposals from industry in support of design analysis, technology maturation, system development and integration, and space flight demonstrations for human lunar landers. The primary objective of this Appendix to the NextSTEP-2 BAA is to enable rapid development and flight demonstrations of human lunar landers by supporting critical studies and risk reduction activities to mature requirements, tailor applicable standards, and create technology maturation plans.</p>
<p><strong>NASA will host a Human Landing System Industry Forum on February 14, 2019, 1:30-4:30 pm EST in Washington, DC at the NASA Headquarters James E. Webb Auditorium</strong>. NASA Administrator James Bridenstine and senior NASA managers will summarize the agency's plans to partner with industry to develop a human lunar landing system. NASA will provide a status of the current lunar architecture and an overview of the NextSTEP-2 Appendix E BAA. The event will include open Question &amp; Answer sessions for industry and the media. Details and updates about the Industry Forum will be posted on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.nasa.gov/nextstep/humanlander</span></strong>.</p>
<p>An important objective of this BAA is to stimulate the commercial space Industry through public-private partnerships. NASA uses the NextSTEP BAA to establish public-private partnerships where NASA shares development cost and risk with industry, while industry builds a viable commercial capability. A key component of the NextSTEP Partnership model is to provide an opportunity for NASA and Industry to collaborate in developing capabilities that meet NASA's space exploration objectives while also supporting industry's commercialization plans. The NextSTEP-2 BAA contract vehicle requires corporate resource contributions for R&amp;D-type activities, including maturing unique technologies.</p>
<p>This BAA Appendix addresses the development of human lunar landing capabilities. NASA is planning three demonstration missions to the lunar surface, with the first crewed human lunar landing targeted for the third mission.</p>
<p>This NextSTEP-2 Appendix E will include a NASA reference human lander architecture configuration. The full architecture will include a Descent Element, Ascent Element, Transfer Vehicle, Refueling Element, and Surface Suit. <strong>This BAA Appendix will request proposals for study and risk reduction efforts focused on the Descent Element, Transfer Vehicle Element, and Refueling Element</strong>.</p>
<p>NASA plans to launch the first demonstration mission in 2024. The minimum objective of this mission is to demonstrate a lunar surface landing with one or more Descent Elements capable of supporting a future human lander that includes both Descent Element and Ascent Element. Contracts awarded under Appendix E may have multiple phases. The first will be for brief studies to mature requirements, tailor applicable standards, procure long-lead parts and implement technology maturation plans for early risk reduction. Following the study, NASA intends to execute future phases that may result in multiple awards, for the Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&amp;E) and flight demonstrations of Descent Elements. NASA is still considering acquisition options for other human lunar lander system Elements. The detailed study requirements and additional information on the overall acquisition strategy will be contained in the forthcoming Appendix E solicitation.</p>
<p>NASA will use the information gained through these initial studies to inform the performance requirements for the human lander system and will work with industry to continue to mature the approach for future missions.</p>
<p>The Point of Contact for technical and programmatic questions on this synopsis is Dr. Greg Chavers, NASA HQ Advanced Exploration Systems Division at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HQ-NextSTEP-BAA@mail.nasa.gov</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Submission information, participant eligibility, additional topic information and specific evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be identified in Appendix E when it is released.</p>

<p>Provide your responses NLT 12PM, Mountain local time, 18 January 2019 to zandra.f.hearn@usace.army.mil. Ensure your response is limited to 5 pages and the Subject Line of your response includes "PLA Survey - USAFA". Please provide your contact information in the body of the email.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement between a Prime contractor and one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S. C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 22.503) Policy provides that:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br />(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor, or certain subcontractors, engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br />(i) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters; and <br />(ii) Be consistent with law. Reference: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement; FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Request responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.<br />(2) Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the reference project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br />(3) Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would affect the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br />(4) Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br />(5) Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br />(6) Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.<br />(7) Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>The information gathered in this survey should include the following information on projects completed in the last 2 - 5 years:<br />1) Project Name and Location<br />2) Detailed Project Description<br />3) Initial Cost Estimate vs. Actual Final Cost<br />4) Was the project completed on time?<br />5) Number of craft trades present on the project<br />6) Was a PLA used?<br />7) Were there any challenges experienced during the project?</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>This is a Design/Build MILCON Project.</p>

<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The work consists of the following major elements:</p>
<p>This project involves the removal and replacement of the fishway (fish ladder), concrete bridge corbels, and pedestrian guardrails at the fish ladder and Mill Creek Division Works structure.</p>
<p>Prior to removal and replacement of the fish ladder, the contractor will be responsible for diversion and care of water in Mill Creek. Flows during the in-water work window will need to be diverted around the worksite and are expected to be around 25 to 40 cfs. The exact composition of the Mill Creek bed is unknown but it is expected to be highly porous sands and cobbles with a mixture of fine sediments. There are no known sources of groundwater inflow within the reach where dewatering is required. However, the streambed composition passes groundwater flow readily so that even with no leakage on a dewatering structure pumping will be necessary to maintain a dry work site.</p>
<p>The contractor will remove a fish ladder that is no longer compliant and replace it with a new compliant fish ladder that is longer and wider in the same location. The work requires dewatering portions of the Mill Creek channel to allow access to the foundation of the existing fish ladder, excavation of part of the levee, concrete saw cutting and demolition, steel decking removal, and minor electrical modifications. The grade of the foundation will be adjusted to match required grades for fish ladder installation. Reinforced concrete will be placed. Excavated portions of the levee will need to be rebuilt, including restoration of riprap. A bicycle path will need to be restored if it is damaged or temporarily removed. Steel decking and electrical items will be replaced but in different locations.</p>
<p>Bridge deck corbel replacement includes saw cutting for removal of the concrete corbels and preparation of a smooth surface using an epoxy. After removal, a bearing pad will be placed between the existing bridge deck and new steel corbel. The steel corbels will be secured to the pier using post installed anchors. The bridge deck must be shored during construction activities.</p>
<p>Pedestrian guardrail replacement will require the existing guardrails be removed in accordance with all appropriate federal regulations concerning lead-based paints. The new guardrails will provide access for maintenance by means of both hinged swing gates and removable sections. They will also require a galvanized protective coating.</p>
<p>On-site work will be June through October 2020 with submittal preparation and approval several months prior. The in-water work window is July 15, 2020 through September 15, 2020.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective on-site Safety and Health program in accordance with EM 385-1-1 that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific Accident Prevention Plan for Government acceptance. In addition, the Contractor will be required to develop and submit for Government acceptance Activity Hazard Analyses for each phase of work and a project specific Fall Protection Plan that comply with EM 385-1-1.</p>
<p>A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) employed by the prime contractor shall be required for each shift of the contractor's on-site operations. The SSHO shall possess a minimum of 5-years' experience in construction safety on similar projects, shall have completed the 30-Hour OSHA Construction Safety training within the last 5-years, and shall have completed at least 24-hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5-years.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective Contractor Quality Control (CQC) System that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific CQC Plan for Government acceptance. A CQC System Manager employed by the prime contractor shall be required to be on-site for each shift of the Contractor's operations. The CQC System Manager must possess a minimum of 5-years relevant experience in a supervisory or management position such as Quality Control Manager, Quality Assurance Manager, or Construction Manager directly involved in the management of construction quality at the project site. In addition, the CQC System Manager shall have completed the course entitled "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" within the last 5-years. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module (referred to as QCS) of the Resident Management System (RMS) to record, maintain, and submit various information throughout the contract period. QCS is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network. The Government will make the QCS software available to the Contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of Contractor furnished submittals for items such as pre-construction plans, product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous work within the project includes the delivery of As-Built Drawings.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNoSpacing">The United States Government represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)/Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the implementation of a five-year USAID/BiH Energy Policy Activity.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments from interested parties on a draft statement of work (attached). Please ensure comments are concise and specific and make specific reference to page and section numbers. USAID does not seek questions at this time, only comments. USAID is not obliged to provide any response to the comments submitted. Please submit your comments to sarajevooaa@usaid.gov by 03:00 p.m. local Sarajevo time, February 11, 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of USAID's Energy Policy Activity is to help BiH harmonize its energy market frameworks with that of the EU Energy Community Treaty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>USAID intends to issue an RFP around February 15, 2019. Please do not consider this announcement as an RFP and do not submit your proposal until the formal RFP is released. There is no incumbent as this is a new requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to publish an RFP, or ultimately issue a contract on the basis of this posting, or to pay for any information voluntarily submitted as a result of this request.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this USAID initiative.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION #: N0017819R4039
<p>Submitted by: Mirenda Robertson<br />NAICS Code: 611430<br />FSC Code: U099</p>
<p>Anticipated Date to be published in FEDBIZOPS: 19 October 2018</p>
<p>Anticipated Closing Date: 8 November 2018</p>
<p>Contracts POC Name: Mirenda Robertson<br />Telephone#: 540-653-9864<br />Email Address: mirenda.robertson@navy.mil</p>
<p>Code and Description: U - Training Services<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Solicitation N0017819R4039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements. The resultant BPA award will be a total of five (5) years to include a base year plus four (4) option years. The Government is obligated only to the extent of the authorized orders made under the BPA.</p>
<p>Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal because this notice will result in a BPA. In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.</p>
<p>This Synopsis/Solicitation is open to all business concerns; however, in accordance with FAR 19.501, the Governments' intent is to establish BPAs with small businesses. In the event there aren't enough responses from responsible, capable small businesses, then large business responses will be considered. Individual call numbers shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $250,000. Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 will be utilized. The Government reserves the right to add/delete vendors at any time throughout the life of the BPA. There is no minimum or maximum Government obligation.</p>
<p>Please include the total price for the base year and all option years. In addition, include the individual cost for each of the classes at each specific location. See Statement of Objectives for estimated number of courses and locations. Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) will be utilized for award in accordance with FAR Part 12. The order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Responsibility determination will also precede issuance of a BPA and will be conducted in accordance with FAR 9.104. Interested parties are encouraged to address the seven elements of responsibility contained in FAR 9.104 and to complete FAR Clause 52.219-1.</p>
<p>The BPA will be issued based on the criteria outlined in Attachment B. FAILURE TO SUPPLY THE REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BE AWARDED A BPA.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on registration in SAM by calling 866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Quote is due 08 November 2018, no later than 10:00 a.m. EST with an anticipated award date by 30 November 2018. Questions and responses regarding this synopsis/solicitation may be submitted by e-mail to mirenda.robertson@navy.mil prior to the RFQ closing. Email should reference Synopsis/Solicitation Number <br />N0017819R4039 in the subject line.</p>

<AWDNBR>TBD
<AWDDATE>020819
<DESC>The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) or Voice of America (VOA), Office of Contracts (CON) located at 330 Independence Ave, SW., Washington, D.C. 20237, intends to negotiate and award one (1) sole source contracts to the following Contractor:
<p>Evertz Microsystems, LTD. - 5292 John Lucas Drive Burlington, Ont Canada L7L 5Z9</p>
<p>USAGM awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (BBG50-D-16-0004) and supporting task order (BBG50-J-17-0132) to Communication Engineering Inc. (CEI) on September 29, 2017.  The contract and subsequent task order was terminated for default effective November 20, 2018.  The aforementioned subcontractor of the terminated contract is the only contractor that can finalize the work needed by the USAGM.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall continue providing operations and engineering maintenance training on EMR/Magnum from the pre-existing contract; as they possess the capability and historical knowledge of the requirement deemed necessary to complete the USAGM's mission.</p>
<p>This award will be for the period of performance of one (1) year. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3304(a)(1) which is implemented at FAR 6.302-1 as follows: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." <br />The proposed sole source award requires that this unique training be provided from the aforementioned Contractor.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the Contractor began establishing training dates and times with the USAGM.   A minimum of 4 weeks notice for international and 2 weeks notice for US bookings were required.  USAGM receives no credit for any unused training, therefore any attempt to obtain the training from another Contractor would result in an interruption of services and there would be an additional cost to the Government, in addition to further delay of the project completion. USAGM did not identify any additional potential sources beyond the aforementioned Contractor who can meet its requirement.</p>
<p>It has been determined that Evertz is the only Contractor capable and authorized to continue providing the required training. See attached agency justification. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive price proposals. Interested firms must submit a written response that demonstrates their ability to provide the training as referenced in the attached Statement of Work. Also, interested firms must state how they would fulfill the requirement and include appropriate documentation describing the number of years they have been providing such training.</p>
<p>The written response received from interested firms shall provide sufficient detail to allow for an evaluation by the Government without the need for the submission of additional information. The written response must be submitted to Amber Gray, Contract Specialist/Contractor Support, by Friday, February 8, 2019, 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time via email at agray@usagm.gov and jacosta@usagm.gov. ALL ATTACHMENTS MUST BE SENT IN "PDF FORMAT" AND INCLUDE THE FBO NOTICE NUMBER IN THE SUBJECT LINE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TOTAL SIZE OF ALL ATTACHMENTS MUST NOT EXCEED 23MB. Telephone or faxed responses are NOT acceptable and will NOT be considered. Any questions regarding this Notice of Intent shall be in writing and submitted to Ms. Amber Gray, Contract Specialist/Contractor Support via e-mail to agray@usagm.gov and Mr. Jacob Acosta, Contracting Officer via e-mail to jacosta@usagm.gov, and must include the FBO Notice Number in the subject line. Any determination to compete or not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. This Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.</p>

<p>As this procurement will be for evaluation purposes only, the Government will assess a competitive acquisition strategy if the limited batch is favorably evaluated and future quantities are needed.Since this purchase is to procure commercial items only, there are no subcontract opportunities available for small businesses.</p>

FAR 6.302-1 -  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
Agency Requirements
Contract Award Date: 
January 21, 2019 
Contract Award Number: 
LEASE NO. 36C10F19L0004
Synopsis: 
 
The VA currently occupies 124,146 square feet of property which yields 2.85 acres of land in St. Augustine, Florida, under Revocable License 640-14-001 which is due to expire on 12/31/2018. VA intends to negotiate a replacement land lease with the current Licensor without full and open competition based on Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. VA is taking such action to ensure continued occupancy and prevent disruption of critical patient care services as it completes the construction of a new clinic. 
 
The requirement includes 124,146 square feet (2.85 acres) of land currently being utilized to host temporary modular trailers and a surface parking area that accommodates approximately one hundred twenty (120) parking spaces for the St. Augustine Community Based Outpatient Clinic. 

There is a continuing need for operations on the property while a long-term lease facility is constructed and activated which will replace the current clinic. 

The anticipated term of the land lease is an initial term of twenty-four months, commencing on January 1, 2019, with three (3) consecutive four (4) month renewal options which may be exercised only by the VA. 

A land lease will be utilized instead of a Revocable License. 
The estimated total cost for the initial term and all options is $ 548,540 based on existing license fees and standard industry escalation. 

The delineated area is unchanged as the intent is to remain in place.

Contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 866-606-8220 or via the internet at https://sam.gov.
