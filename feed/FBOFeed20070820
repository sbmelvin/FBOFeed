<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region and National Park Service, Lake Mead National Recreation Area (LMNRA) have a requirement for a planning study to determine whether a Lake Mead - Hoover Dam Welcome Center is feasible, and if so what size it should be, where it should be located, and how it should be organized and operated.  The facility would be a multi-use "gateway" to the Lake Mead LMNRA and to Hoover Dam that would enhance tourism by orienting visitors to recreational, educational, and sightseeing opportunities in the LMNRA and at Hoover Dam.  The facility would likely serve as a hub for various modes of transportation providing access to points in the LMNRA and to Hoover Dam, and would provide parking for visitors and tour buses.  The welcome center would be designed to achieve LEED (Silver or greater) certification and to fit harmoniously with the natural landscape and existing facilities in the area.  Site selection is an important element in achieving LEED certification. The study will include determining problems and needs; formulating alternatives; developing operational plans, estimating construction and operation costs; assessing non-federal funding sources; preparing business plans to show self-sustaining operation; evaluating alternative energy sources; and conducting evaluations such as a fatal flaw analysis, a multi-attribute matrix analysis, and a value analysis.  Interim reports and presentations, as well as a final report will be required to document the study results.   The place of contract performance is at the successful contractor's location and Boulder City, NV.  Boulder City is 26 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada.

That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-tdetermined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requiremnts for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design.  Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability fo the compatiiblity of the components within existing systems and overall performance.  The estitmated DoS cost for this purchase of these bran name hardware and associated support products is approximately $__. As this is a brand name only justifications, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for thsi justifiaiton. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.  The products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS (diplomatic Security) and USAID security requiremtns as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Biotechnology Core Facility (CCID/NCPDCID/DSR) needs to obtain from dnaLIMS, Inc., the following items: oligoLIMS and peptideLIMS modules with custom modifications, a custom unified LIMS interface and a customized mysql database interface to be installed in the currently running dnaLIMS software suite.  This software upgrade will enhance the functionality of the currently installed system.  The additional modules to be added to the system will provide electronic job tracking/process flow management, reagent lot tracking, more accurate project pricing and better quality control data collection/storage.  These systems will operate as a single interface with extension for report generation into the existing database system. 
Thus, to the best of our knowledge, dnaLIM, Inc is the only  responsible source that can provide the above mentioned equipment and service needed to satisfy the program requirement. Therefore, dnaLIMS, Inc. is considered to be sole source IAW/FAR 6.302-1 and award of a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13 is contemplated to it.  However, CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to the RFQ. All questions/concerns about the RFQ shall be submitted via e-mail to Bbiltz@cdc.gov ONLY.

<DESC>Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. AG-518P-S-07-AA02 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 333111.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  The equipment must meet or exceed the following statement of work and salient characteristics:  USDA/ARS, Invasive Weed Management Unit (IWMU), Urbana, IL Location is in need of a Linear Irrigation System which will be used to irrigate their research fields Statement of Work:   Prolonged dry spells during natural rainfall patterns in East-Central Illinois create enormous methodological challenges to field research programs in vegetable crops and organic cropping systems.  Many vegetable crops are moderately to highly susceptible to drought, and absence of precipitation at key physiological development stages can compromise or ruin experiments.  Moreover, studies on weed ecology and management in these systems often require growing multiple species concurrently under specific experimental criteria.  The IWMU conducts most of their field research at the University of Illinois South Farms, in both the Departments of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES) and the Department of Crop Sciences.  The Vegetable Crop Farm of NRES is the only research ground that has an irrigation system, which is composed of two reel lines which apply water through two high-pressure nozzles spaced 120 feet apart.  The irrigation pattern is highly variable, depending in large part on wind speed and direction.  Because reels and supply lines have to be moved manually, the system of applied water increases experimental variation and is particularly problematic for season-long experiments.  A new irrigation system must be compatible with the water delivery system and plot layout of NRES Vegetable Crop Farm, Champaign, IL.  The proposed linear irrigation system will be used to supplement natural rainfall at key methodological time points, such as following planting, prior to experimental treatment, or at important physiological development stages.  The linear irrigation system would automate much of the irrigation process, enabling for more timely irrigation.  Moreover, power of statistical analyses, thereby improving statistical inference and interpretation of test results.  The improvements will be most notable for season-long experiments conducted by IWMU.  The salient characteristics are as follows:  1)  Compatible with water delivery system of NRES Vegetable Crop Farm, 2921 S. First St., Champaign, IL  61821 2) One-tower linear irrigation system 207 feet in length and 85 feet extension assembly with 9 feet clearance  3)  End-feed drive  4)  Diesel engine pumping unit  5)  Programmable control panel with password protection  6)  90-degree wheel rotation for system towing  7)  continuous hydraulic drive  8)  Galvanized spans and corrosion resistant parts  9)  Low pressure sprinklers on 10 feet spacing  10)  Furrow guidance system  11)  4 inch soft drag hose 660 feet in length  12) warranty and installation and/or operation training information are requested  DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE:  Offerors shall submit 2 copies of the descriptive Literature describing their proposed equipment in enough detail to ascertain whether the equipment meets the criteria listed above.

PARKER, CONTRACTING OFFICER, 407-380-4054, lisa.c.parker@us.army.mil ******** The Government is in need of supplies and services to upgrade the existing U.S. Army National Guard (ARNG) Combat Arms Training Systems (CATS) FATS IV training systems.  The contractor shall design, fabricate, test, and install the Combined Arms Training S ystems (CATS) FATS IV upgrade for the four (4) lane CATS training system with standardized weapons mix in support of the Army National Guard (ARNG).  This will be a contract to upgrade the 265 currently fielded systems up to the U.S. Engagement Skills Trai ner Training Systems Requirements Document. The ARNG CATS FATS IV is used primarily as a unit and institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multilane, small arms and crew served training simulator.  It provides audio and visual presentations and feedback during  training scenario exercises simulating the operation of a variety of small arms weapons.  The simulator utilizes visual display system(s), audio system(s), aiming detection system(s), pseudo or modified real weapons with weapon power source interfaced by computer to provide Marksmanship, Shoot/Dont Shoot decision training, and Unit Collective Squad Level training scenarios.  The CATS FATS IV safely replicates weapon training events which lead to live fire individual and crew weapon qualification and that contribute to increased weapon, crew, fire team, and squad combat effectiveness training in Army defined scenarios.  The requirement to be contracted under this action is  to upgrade the fielded CATS FATS IV systems to provide enhanced marksmanship, shoot/ dont shoot and collective training that is compliant with the U.S. Army Training Systems Requirement Document (TSRD) standards.  This effort will include the production and fielding of upgrade kits that will implement the required changes to the fielded u nits.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Policy and International Affairs, intends to award a purchase order to The Institute of the Americas (IOA) of La Jolla, CA for a one-day policy workshop.  The IOA is a 501 (c) non-profit organization located in La Jolla, California on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. The purpose of the Andean Energy Workshop, having a tentative date of December 4, 2007, is to focus primarily on the role of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Peru/Colombia.  In addition, the workshop will discuss how increased attention on policies relating to these topics could enhance the relevant national economies and thus improve competitiveness of these South American countries. Previously The IOA has worked closely with DOE on a Cross Border Natural Gas Workshop, which included a Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) Stakeholders Meeting. For over 20 years, The IOA has worked to promote economic development and integration throughout the Western Hemisphere by emphasizing the importance of frank dialogue between government, civil society and the private sector. The Contractor will be responsible for all logistical details to include hotel meeting space, audio visual, interpretation, and room set up. The proposed award will be for a period of approximately 5 months. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<RESPDATE>070607
<CONTACT>Dwight  Taeza, Contracting Officer, Phone 310.416-1510, Email dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is requesting Industry Day participation relating to the Space Control Depot Support (SCDS) Sustainment Contract.  This event is scheduled for 24 July 2007 from 0800 - 1200 PST at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  Following the presentation and general Q&A session, the Space Superiority Operations Support and Sustainment Division (SYSW/OS) will conduct one-on-one discussions with all interested Industry Day attendees.  Each Prime contractor will be authorized 6-8 personnel at the forth coming Industry Day.  One of the attendees must be a security person. One-on-one sessions will take place on the 24th immediately after the Industry Day presentation and if needed the 25th & 26th.   Each one-on-one session will be 45 minutes unless there is a need to shorten the sessions to 30 min due to the number of interested contractors.

On 26 January, 2007, the initial Industry Day for SYSW Sustainment Support was conducted.  Since then the government has revised its strategy and acquisition approach. The original approach was to award multiple contracts through an IDIQ contract and is now revised to award a single contract. This industry day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the updated goals, requirements and strategy for acquiring sustainment support services for the various SMC/SYSW ground-based deployable systems.  The programs supported by this contract include: the Counter Communication System (CCS) Family of Systems, the Space Test and Training Range (STTR) Family of Systems, the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Family of Systems and Rapid Reaction Capabilities (RRCs), along with any future deployable SYSW system whose sustainment requirements are in-line with the scope of the SCDS contract.  The SCDS contract will be managed by SYSW/OS. Detailed system descriptions for SCDS programs will be presented at the Industry Day.

The sustainment requirements of the SCDS contract are broken into five functional areas: 1) Depot Support, 2) Studies & Analysis, 3) System Upgrades and Modifications, 4) Rapid Reaction Capability Transition to Operational Systems, and 5) Organizational Level Maintenance.  Depot support consists of the following: depot and sustainment engineering (D&SE), repairable and disposable item management, stock, storage and issuance of spares, hardware and software maintenance and repairs, sparing level analysis, etc.  Studies and analysis projects in support of the basic program mission includes, but is not limited to: analyses to reduce life cycle costs, improving availability and maintainability, the replacement of obsolete or /unsupportable equipment, the evaluation of future capability enhancements, preplanned product improvement (P3I), etc.  System upgrades and modifications may include the development, test, production and installation of system upgrades.  The transition of RRCs to operational systems includes activities such as developing technical orders (TOs), drawing packages, performing provisioning analysis and procuring spares and support equipment, and configuration management and standardization of hardware and software. Organization Level Maintenance is defined as on-site maintenance support at operational units.  

All attending contractors shall submit a Statement of Capabilities describing their qualifications to be the Prime contractor for the SCDS effort which includes information regarding experience with establishing public/private partnerships for depot support, contractor experience with transportable/deployable ground systems and information demonstrating compliance with the aforementioned security requirements. Each potential Prime must submit a Statement of Capability to Mr. Dwight Taeza at Dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil no later than the close of business on 6 July 2007.  

Responses from small and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.

To attend the Industry Day each potential Prime shall submit a SF86 for each attendee. All attendees must have a current TS/SSBI and be briefed SI/TK. In addition all attendees must meet Tier 1 Special Access Programs adjudication standards. In those instances where an attendee is currently accessed to Air Force Special Access Programs sponsored by SAF/AAZ or SMC/SY, contractors shall submit only a Personnel Access Request (PAR) provided the individual has a current TS/SSBI. The justification will state "Access is requested to attend Sustainment Industry Day on 24 July." Block 1 of the PAR will be left blank. SF86's and PARs must be received NLT 11 July 2007. Any submissions which do not meet Tier 1 adjudication standards will be processed last and probably will not be completed in time to facilitate attendance. If there are any questions contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 or gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil. 

All approved attendees will be indoctrinated at the Industry Day and details of the RFP and acquisition strategy will be disclosed at that time. Those potential Primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the RFP. Contractors may submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) at the same time the personnel security paperwork is submitted. Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort. A full fledge DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS is required. If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and it is currently accredited by another agency, that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort. Contact Mr. Crafton regarding information/paperwork that will be required. SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While possessing an accredited SCIF is not a requirement to participate in the 24 July 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified SCDS RFP without having a secure SCIF to store the information in. 

Each potential Prime team will be authorized a total of 40 quotas for the RFP effort.  SYSW Security will not process any more than 6-8 access requests until an approved facility is established and the 24 July 07 Industry Day has been completed. If you submit more than 8 access packages prior to industry day, identify the eight that will be attending the industry day as they will be processed first.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James H. Gill SMC/PK.  You can reach him at James.Gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

DECLARATION:  This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) invites interested participants to participate in an Industry Day for the Spiral Development and Sustainment Engineering contract of the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS).  The Industry Day will be held at the Secret/NF level on 12 Sep 07, 10:00 ? 11:00 A.M., at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A8 auditorium, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA.  Each contractor company division will be authorized no more than 3 attendees.  

The contract is expected to have a period of performance of 6 years and begin with a contract transition and spiral development efforts beginning on 1 Sep 08.  It is expected that system sustainment will begin on 1 Dec 08.  System improvements will be accomplished as 18-24 month spiral developments throughout the life of the system.  It is expected that spiral development efforts and sustaining engineering efforts will be approximately equal.

JETSS is in use at JFCC-Space?s Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) as a mission planning and execution monitoring tool of space control assets.  JETSS consists of previously developed software (JAVA software language with WebLogic basis), relational database (Oracle), server (Sun Solaris operating system)-client (Windows) architecture, and commercial-off-the-shelf software applications integrated into a seamless program.  

In order to perform this effort, prime contractors should have extensive knowledge of service oriented architecture/net-centric enterprise services, federated query systems, relational databases, and Information Assurance requirements.  Firms must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret ? SCI/SAP/SAR accredited SCIF(s).  Additionally, firms must have SAP/SAR approved facilities to perform system depot maintenance.  

     If you have interest in being a prime contractor you must submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) not longer than 10 pages describing their qualifications to be the prime contractor as well as explaining their capability to meet the above mentioned knowledge and security clearance requirements.  In addition, the SOC should contain the following information:  technical description of the offeror?s experience and knowledge of Department of Defense military system development and maintenance, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Space Control systems and operations (specifically JSpOC operations), AFSPC Command and Control (C2) operations/architectures, and JSpOC C2 tool development; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; and proof of security clearances for government evaluation.  Additionally, include customers and POCs who can be contacted to validate previous work/qualifications identified in the SOC.  The SOC should be submitted to SYAG/CJD, Attn:  Maj Diane Brashear, and SYSW/PK, Attn:  Mr. Jack May, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA  90245-2808, or e-mail to diane.brashear@losangeles.af.mil and jack.may@losangeles.af.mil, and received by 9:00 A.M. on 4 Sep 07.  It is the Government?s intent that due to the classified nature of this acquisition that no contractor will be given access to any Request for Proposal (RFP) documents if they cannot demonstrate in their SOC submission that the are capable of performing this effort as a prime contractor.

Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  Appropriate small business standards are North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services, with a size of $25 million and 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a size of 1000 employees.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  

To attend Industry Day, please send your RSVP (company name, attendee name and contact number) via email to Maj Brashear, 310-416-1630/diane.brashear@losangeles.af.mil, no later than 12:00 P.M., 6 Sep 07.  In addition, your visit requests should be submitted via JPAS no later than 12:00 P.M., 7 Sep 07.  Send the certification to JPAS SMO Code ?SYS Wing?.  If attendees are unable to send visit requests via JPAS fax them to 310-416-1725, Subj: JETSS Industry Day, Attn: Steve Taylor.

Validated potential primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractors will be expected to submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) prior to receiving the RFP.  Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort.  A full fledged DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS will be required.  If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and is currently accredited by another agency, then that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort upon coordination with SYSW Security.  Contact Mr. Crafton (310) 416-1591, gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil, regarding information/paperwork that will be required.  SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While an accredited SCIF and TS/SCI SSBI cleared personnel are not requirements to participate in the 12 Sep 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified JETSS RFP without having approved personnel and a secure SCIF in which to store information.  

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. John Wagner.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Commercial item/services: NASA/DFRC has a requirement for the renovation of the Building Automation System of Building 703, Los Angeles World Airports Site 9 in Palmdale, CA 93550.	The order of magnitude for the procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000 and the effort shall be completed within 80 calendar days after notice to proceed.  The renovation consists of the following: 	A stand-alone building utility infrastructure, to deliver Chilled Water (CHW) and Hot Water (HW) to the building HVAC equipment. 	Motor replacements and new Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) for the existing Air Handling Units (AHUs). 	New digital controls for 2nd and 3rd floor office spaces, along with duct cleaning. 	New HVAC units to provide conditioned air to the mezzanine areas. 	HVAC controls for all new and existing HVAC equipment, utilizing the Siemens Apogee Building Automation System (BAS). 	Metering equipment for Electricity, Water and Natural Gas usage. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Siemens Building Technologies, Inc of Cypress, CA 90630.  Siemens Building Technologies systems are single source products made up of software, firmware, and hardware that are licensed proprietary products.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Research (CCR) intends to procure Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Services (constructions of bait, constructs, prey libraries, and delivery of resulting binding interaction data) on a sole source basis with Myriad Genetics; 320 Wakara Way; Salt Lake City, Utah 84108.  

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items/services as authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

The purpose of this requirement is for the NCI to acquire access to an efficient and reliable yeast two-hybrid assay technology that maximizes the chances of detecting physiologically relevant binding interactions while minimizing false-positive data.  

Myriad Genetics researchers developed a highly automated and robust high-throughput yeast two-hybrid platform called ProNet.  Using ProNet, each protein of interest is analyzed as a series of several overlapping fragments or baits.   ProNet uses a highly efficient mating strategy whereby a single bait fragment is tested against several million unique prey fragments.  The capacity and throughput of the ProNet process enables Myriad Genetics to do simultaneous analysis of hundreds of proteins.   

Myriad has minimized false positive results that typical plague yeast two-hybrid experiments. The use of multiple reporter genes, specially constructed activation domain libraries, and a panel of proprietary specificity tests substantially reduce the level of false positive results. Furthermore, our analysis of over 56,000 yeast two-hybrid screens has identified those proteins that tend to behave as false positives and permits the elimination of many remaining false positive results. Thus, Myriad estimates that its false positive rate is as low as 1 to 3%, affording a significantly greater fidelity than other yeast two-hybrid platforms.

Myriad Genetics is the only source known to the NCI that offers a unique combination of experience, technology, bio-informatics, activation domain libraries and industrial scale throughput to enable and complete a custom yeast two-hybrid program.  Myriad Genetics resources and experimental approaches ensure the highest quality of results in the shortest time frame. No other technology is capable of completing so many high quality, exhaustive, yeast two-hybrid searches for a single protein in 4 to 6 months.  

Myriad?s strategy dictates that an average of 30 searches are performed on any one given protein. Other laboratories are not able to complete such an exhaustive search program on any one protein, and therefore are unable to ensure delivery of such comprehensive results. The capacity and throughput of the ProNet process enables Myriad to pursue this unique screening strategy.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition regulations the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Princeton University, Department of Molecular Biology, 229 Lewis Thomas Laboratory, Washington Rd., Princeton, NJ  08544 for the integration of the Colon Cancer kNowledge Utility Toolbox (CoCaNUT) into caBIG.  The CDP supported the building of data models for a large data set of molecular alterations in colon cancer generated in a program project, P01 CA065930-08. One goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive molecular data characterizing 600 colon cancers.  The data includes microarray analysis of gene expression, mutation analysis, array CGH analysis of genomic alterations, microarray-based SNP analysis, DNA methylation analysis and analysis of micro-satellite instability.  The investigators have completed analysis of ~500 colon tumors and are analyzing the additional tumors.  The investigators are making all of the data available to the research community through the caBIG infrastructure established by NCICB.  They collaborated with NCICB staff to build the data models needed to integrate the different types of molecular data and to make it available through an application called CoCaNUT.  They have also built analytical tools including viewers for RNA and SNP data and novel tools to analyze LOH and copy number alterations.  These tools will be fully integrated into the caBIG framework.  This procurement will support three specific development goals to ensure the full integration of the CoCaNUT application into caBIG.  They are:  1)  Build an interface between caBIG tools and the colon cancer data in CoCaNUT;  2)  Adapt and link the analytical tools developed by the PI to the colon cancer data via caBIG; and 3)  Build a platform which will allow the integration of data in CoCaNUT with colon cancer data generated by other investigators.  The investigators at Princeton University are the only known source to the NCI Researcher that has both the software development capability, the intimate familiarity with the colon cancer data and the expertise required to develop the data modules required for the CoCaNUT database.  More critically, they have the large data sets of molecular alterations in colon cancer and are highly motivated to make it available to the research community.  No other investigators have comparable data sets.  The tasks remaining to make this data openly available to the community are to build the interfaces that will allow the easy linking of the data and the tools for data analysis and to facilitate the integration of their data with other existing colon cancer data.  These investigators have the software development capability and knowledge of the colon cancer data models which will allow them to rapidly build interfaces required to complete the project.  The investigators have been working closely with NCICB staff to facilitate the integration of the CoCaNUT application into caBIG. They are uniquely positioned to complete this project.

<DESC>NOTICE:  All RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED BY EMAIL TO MR. GIL MORALES, SANDIA CONTRACTING REPRESENTATIVE; gemoral@sandia.gov.
DO NOT SEND ANY RESPONSES TO POSTING AGENT DONALD ROSEBOROUGH.

SOW for 6 LTD Cavities and One Voltage Adder
Under its Contract with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Sandia National Laboratories intends to purchase 6 LTD (Linear Transformer Driver) cavities in a voltage adder configuration.  The LTD technology is a new method for constructing high-current, high-voltage pulsers.  The salient feature of the approach is switching and inductively adding the pulses at low voltage straight out of the capacitors through low inductance transfer and soft iron core isolation.  High currents can be achieved by feeding each soft iron core with many low inductance and capacitance capacitors and switches connected in parallel in a circular array.  High voltage is obtained by inductively adding many LTD cavities in series in an inductive voltage adder configuration.  An inductive voltage adder is a structure that inductively adds the voltage pulses of many LTD cavities stacked together in a linear array
Each LTD cavity should have as output an electrical pulse of 100-kV peak voltage and 1-MA peak current when applied to 0.1-Ohm resistive load.  The full width at half maximum of the pulse (FWHM) must be 100ns.
The LTD cavities must be cylindrical doughnut shaped with approximate dimension as follows: 3-m diameter, 20 cm height with an inner coaxial cylindrical opening of ~1.8 ?m in diameter.  The cavities should look like a giant pill-box with a cylindrical aperture in the middle.  They should be vacuum tight and have a plastic insulator in the middle plane capable of holding the 100-kV without arcing.  Each LTD cavity will be inductively isolated, and at all times the outside cavity surfaces should be at ground potential. The cavity walls must be made out of steel and be strong enough to withstand the weight of each entire cavity positioned either horizontally or vertically.  They should have on the outside cylindrical surface fixtures for lifting them and also small whiles to install them in a rail system half way above the axis of the cavities.  
The 6 cavities shall be stackable with ?o? rings so the center cylindrical openings (holes)  form a vacuum tight inner cylinder which will serve as the anode electrode of a 600-kV inductive voltage adder.  The common bore of the 6 cavities will form the anode electrode of the voltage adder.  Nothing should be added onto the two parallel outside flat surfaces of the cavities, so that when the six of them are stacked together in series, the total voltage adder length must not be longer than 1.25m.
A cylinder of diameter approx 1.6m and length of 1.5 m should be built to serve as the cathode electrode of the voltage adder.  An electron vacuum diode must be designed, built, and installed at the output end of the voltage adder with an impedance of 0.6 Ohms.
The voltage adder assembly must be tested in operation before delivery.
The operating output voltage of the voltage adder, between the cathode and anode electrode, should be 600-kV on a 0.6-Ohm diode and resistive loads.
Each LTD cavity shall have an efficiency ,wall power to output power, better than 70%. 
A trigger pulse generator of 100-kV peak pulse voltage should also be built capable to trigger simultaneously the switches of all the 6 cavities.
Because of critical mission needs the LTD cavities, the cathode electrode, the electron vacuum diode and resistive loads, and the trigger generator of the voltage adder shall be delivered no later than 10 months following the award of a contract.

Mandatory Requirements for this Request for Interest

1.	Firms shall provide verifiable evidence of their demonstrated past experience and ability to build five 1-MA, 100-kV LTD cavities. 
2.	Firms shall provide evidence of their demonstrated past experience and ability to test each one of the 1-MA, 100-kV LTD cavities to a 100kV charging and produce an output pulse of 1-MA, 100-kV on a matched load of 0.1 Ohm.
3.	Firms shall provide evidence of their past experience and ability to configure at least five LTD cavities in a voltage adder configuration.
4.	Firms shall provide evidence of their past experience and ability to test at least a 5-LTD cavity voltage adder with a diode load for at least 50 shots at capacitor charge voltage of 90kV.
5.	Firms shall provide evidence of their past experience and ability to design and test a vacuum electron diode as a load for a five LTD cavity voltage adder.

Respondents to this Request that do not provide verifiable and acceptable documentation thoroughly addressing each of the five (5) above mandatory requirements will not be given any further consideration by Sandia.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Request for  Information is intended to provide the Air Force with an understanding of  the interest within industry, the technology, and resources available to  support competitive acquisition of a contract to cover sustaining  engineering and contractor logistics support (CLS)  of the avionics system  for 450 AETC (Air Education and Training Command), 3 AFMC (Air Force  Materiel Command) and 10 Navy T-38C aircraft and related ground support  equipment.  Sustaining engineering, but not CLS parts support, also  extends to T-38C Aircrew Training Devices (ATD), including Operational  Flight Trainer (OFT), the Unit Training Device (UTD) and the Weapon System  Trainer (WST).  The T-38C avionics system consists of approximately 60  non-developmental items (NDI) and commercial Line Replaceable Units  (LRUs).  The contract will be a firm-fixed price, performance based  contract consisting of a base year (FY09) with four additional years of  FFP (Firm Fixed Price) options.  The contract will provide for: a)	A block upgrade process that keeps the T-38C aircraft airworthy and  current by providing up-to-date capabilities (e.g. GPS approach). b)	Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations at  each of AETCs T-38 main operating bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus  AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB with the ability to support  operations at Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS); c)	Contractor supplied spare parts and equipment; Contractor repair of  removed components at the contractors (or Original Equipment Manufacturers)  facilities and return to COMBS, based upon a fixed price for each of the  annual number of hours flown by AETC, AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School  (approximately 110,000 hours total annually); d)	Technical order recommendations to responsible engineering  organization; e)	Contractor repair of damaged AUP equipment and maintain an effective  damaged equipment program; f)	Field Service Representatives at each of the AETC MOBs, Edwards AFB and  Patuxent River NAS; g)	Systems engineering processes to resolve any issues involving software  support and material deficiency reporting; h)	A system that collects, manages, analyzes and archives Maintenance  Fault Lists (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL), engine, flight loads and ACMI  (Air Combat Maneuvering Information) data for each flight, including  mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis and could lead to  product improvement; i)	An effective means to manage obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing  Sources; j)	Systems engineering and program management services to keep the T-38  training system up to date, current, and airworthy. k)	Maintenance of Technical Data Package l)	Periodic technical review of in-service system performance, to include  monthly performance factor reports for the USG m)	Over and Above (O & A) activities necessary for correction of problems  found during maintenance; n)	Materials for the O & A corrections; o)	In coordination with government organizations having systems  engineering responsibility, resolve any issues involving software support,  engineering services and material deficiency reporting 2.  Sustaining Engineering process provides sustaining program and  business management, sustaining engineering capability and the block  upgrade process including requirements definition/generation, ECP  (Engineering Change Proposal) and proposal preparation, and, test and  implementation of the change.  Sustaining Engineering includes systems  engineering and program management services to keep the avionics system  for the T-38C training system up to date, current, and airworthy.  The  contractor will provide configuration management and control for the AUP  components to include requirements and certification traceability,  specification trees, supplier management, and diminishing resources  management.  The contractor will record, monitor, and analyze equipment  failures and provide recommendations to maintain or improve aircraft  readiness levels.  The contractor will provide both technical and  programmatic risk management.  The technical services provided also  include on-demand accident investigation analysis and support.  The  engineering and programmatic expertise includes planning for major and  minor modifications to the avionics system for product improvements or as  a result of discontinued commercial items (e.g. memory cards).  The T-38  community must be able to react quickly and positively to real world  changes and have sufficient depth to bring in specific expertise from  outside the program as required.  A block upgrade process is included that  keeps the aircraft airworthy and current by providing up-to-date  capabilities (e.g. GPS approach).  The changing world of Air Traffic  Control (ATC) and Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) has required  changes in radio performance (frequency narrowing), additional equipment  (i.e., Traffic Collision and Avoidance System), and has significantly  increased the pilot workload in heavily used airspace.  The USAF is  mandating software interface requirements for all software running on  networks which mandates major changes in all T-38 software.  The block  upgrade process enables a systems engineering approach to systematically  upgrade the aircraft and training system to keep it viable in a changing  world.  See Attachment 3 for additional details. 3.  Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed AUP components,  providing spares during repair process, performing Field Service  Representative tasks, and operation of a Contractor Operated Maintenance  Base Supply (COMBS) at each AETC MOB.  The period of performance for this  contract is planned FY09 through FY13. The T-38C Sustainment approach will  include performance based logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure  (MTBF) at the avionics system level, and at the LRU (Line Replaceable  Unit) level (system level avionics MTBF of 55 hours).  Guaranteed part  turn-around times and issue rates at the COMBS are planned.  In order to  comply with the COMBS turn around times, the contractor must assure that  sufficient spares are available or other arrangements are in place to  assure that these times are met. Other metrics and your suggestions for  metrics will be considered.    A technical data package (most current  configuration) will most likely be available Sep 2007.  The contractor  must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as  required to support repairs if by foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers  (OEMs) or authorized repair facilities.   See Attachment 2 for more COMBS  details. 4. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an  offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8617-08-R-6170 RESPONSE DATE: 7 Sep 07 NAIC CODE: 336413 DOLLAR AMOUNT: N/A CONTACT INFORMATION: ADDRESS: 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Rm. 201-I Wright Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7211   45433 Primary POC: 1Lt Josh Trantham PHONE NUMBER: 937-904-4306 Alternate POC:  Rick Detamore PHONE NUMBER: 937-904-4160 Contracts POC:  Marisa Osborne PHONE NUMBER: 937-904-4174 Attachment 2 - Additional COMBS Description Stand-up of the COMBS functions is required immediately after the  beginning of FY09.  In order to prevent misconceptions regarding the scope  of this effort, weve attached a more comprehensive description of the  COMBS requirement. As indicated by its name, the T-38C COMBS is the issue point for  replacement of failed AUP parts and equipment at each AETC base.  When a  component discrepancy is found by the flight line maintenance  organization, AUP parts and equipment are returned to the COMBS for a  serviceable replacement.  The T-38C COMBS contractor ships the failed unit  to the qualified repair source, who in turn repairs and returns the unit.  The contractor is responsible for establishing a contract with the repair  source for equipment maintenance and repair.  The T-38C AUP COMBS concept  requires the contractor to establish and maintain an inventory of spare  parts and equipment for replacement of faulty equipment.  Upon receipt by  the COMBS, repaired equipment is stocked as a spare. The Government will provide, as a minimum, access to facilitate vendor  deliveries to the COMBS facilities, (i.e. flight line access  areas/permission when required), loading dock, air conditioning, heat,  water, and 110AC, 60hz power to the COMBS administrative areas and 110AC,  60hz power to the warehouse space. The Government will provide building  repair, parking space for Contractor employees, custodial services, and  outside landscaping.  Using these resources the contractor will provide  sufficient qualified personnel to operate the COMBS during normal  opera

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is requesting Industry Day participation relating to the Space Control Depot Support (SCDS) Sustainment Contract.  This event is scheduled for 24 July 2007 from 0800 - 1200 PST at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  Following the presentation and general Q&A session, the Space Superiority Operations Support and Sustainment Division (SYSW/OS) will conduct one-on-one discussions with all interested Industry Day attendees.  Each Prime contractor will be authorized 6-8 personnel at the forth coming Industry Day.  One of the attendees must be a security person. One-on-one sessions will take place on the 24th immediately after the Industry Day presentation and if needed the 25th & 26th.   Each one-on-one session will be 45 minutes unless there is a need to shorten the sessions to 30 min due to the number of interested contractors.

On 26 January, 2007, the initial Industry Day for SYSW Sustainment Support was conducted.  Since then the government has revised its strategy and acquisition approach. The original approach was to award multiple contracts through an IDIQ contract and is now revised to award a single contract. This industry day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the updated goals, requirements and strategy for acquiring sustainment support services for the various SMC/SYSW ground-based deployable systems.  The programs supported by this contract include: the Counter Communication System (CCS) Family of Systems, the Space Test and Training Range (STTR) Family of Systems, the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Family of Systems and Rapid Reaction Capabilities (RRCs), along with any future deployable SYSW system whose sustainment requirements are in-line with the scope of the SCDS contract.  The SCDS contract will be managed by SYSW/OS. Detailed system descriptions for SCDS programs will be presented at the Industry Day.

The sustainment requirements of the SCDS contract are broken into five functional areas: 1) Depot Support, 2) Studies & Analysis, 3) System Upgrades and Modifications, 4) Rapid Reaction Capability Transition to Operational Systems, and 5) Organizational Level Maintenance.  Depot support consists of the following: depot and sustainment engineering (D&SE), repairable and disposable item management, stock, storage and issuance of spares, hardware and software maintenance and repairs, sparing level analysis, etc.  Studies and analysis projects in support of the basic program mission includes, but is not limited to: analyses to reduce life cycle costs, improving availability and maintainability, the replacement of obsolete or /unsupportable equipment, the evaluation of future capability enhancements, preplanned product improvement (P3I), etc.  System upgrades and modifications may include the development, test, production and installation of system upgrades.  The transition of RRCs to operational systems includes activities such as developing technical orders (TOs), drawing packages, performing provisioning analysis and procuring spares and support equipment, and configuration management and standardization of hardware and software. Organization Level Maintenance is defined as on-site maintenance support at operational units.  

All attending contractors shall submit a Statement of Capabilities describing their qualifications to be the Prime contractor for the SCDS effort which includes information regarding experience with establishing public/private partnerships for depot support, contractor experience with transportable/deployable ground systems and information demonstrating compliance with the aforementioned security requirements. Each potential Prime must submit a Statement of Capability to Mr. Dwight Taeza at Dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil no later than the close of business on 6 July 2007.  

Responses from small and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.

To attend the Industry Day each potential Prime shall submit a SF86 for each attendee. All attendees must have a current TS/SSBI and be briefed SI/TK. In addition all attendees must meet Tier 1 Special Access Programs adjudication standards. In those instances where an attendee is currently accessed to Air Force Special Access Programs sponsored by SAF/AAZ or SMC/SY, contractors shall submit only a Personnel Access Request (PAR) provided the individual has a current TS/SSBI. The justification will state "Access is requested to attend Sustainment Industry Day on 24 July." Block 1 of the PAR will be left blank. SF86's and PARs must be received NLT 11 July 2007. Any submissions which do not meet Tier 1 adjudication standards will be processed last and probably will not be completed in time to facilitate attendance. If there are any questions contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 or gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil. 

All approved attendees will be indoctrinated at the Industry Day and details of the RFP and acquisition strategy will be disclosed at that time. Those potential Primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the RFP. Contractors may submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) at the same time the personnel security paperwork is submitted. Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort. A full fledge DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS is required. If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and it is currently accredited by another agency, that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort. Contact Mr. Crafton regarding information/paperwork that will be required. SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While possessing an accredited SCIF is not a requirement to participate in the 24 July 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified SCDS RFP without having a secure SCIF to store the information in. 

Each potential Prime team will be authorized a total of 40 quotas for the RFP effort.  SYSW Security will not process any more than 6-8 access requests until an approved facility is established and the 24 July 07 Industry Day has been completed. If you submit more than 8 access packages prior to industry day, identify the eight that will be attending the industry day as they will be processed first.

All attendees must send a Visit Notification to SYSW. All attendees must have a current SSBI/SBPR and be briefed SI/TK.

Attendees who are currently accessed to AF SAPS may send there Visit Notifications to us through Special Access Channels.

Attendees who are briefed SI/TK but are not currently accessed to AF SAPS must send there Visit via JPAS. Send the Certification to JPAS SMO Code "SYS Wing". The Technical POC is Maj Russ Swart. Phone # 310-416-1590.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James H. Gill SMC/PK.  You can reach him at James.Gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

DECLARATION:  This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

<SOLNBR>N00189-07-R-0032
<CONTACT>Aninze Awanna, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-443-1328, Fax 757-443-1337, Email aninze.awanna@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN: Offerors are invited to examine the Navy Source Selection Plan (SSP) which will be available for review and posted as a separate document with the release of the solicitation on or before 14  September 2007. The SSP will be located at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 and the SSP will be posted on or before 14 September 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women's Health Initiative II
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NHLBI-WHI-SS-09-01
<RESPDATE>090107
<ARCHDATE>09012007
<CONTACT>Paul McFarlane, Chief, ECA/WHI Branch, Phone 301-435-0345, Fax 301-480-3430, Email pmcfarlane@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND

The NIH has supported collection of blood samples and clinical data from participants in the three clinical trials and the observational study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) since 1993.  This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NHLBI and the WHI centers.  Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a large and concerted effort which may exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of WHI as a whole.  The NHLBI and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources.  In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important that samples and data collected with public funds be made available, with the least amount of restrictions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.

NHLBI and NIH programs were reviewed to determine whether existing projects will satisfy the requirement, and the proposed activity was discussed with key staff in NHLBI and other NIH Institutes to determine that this BAA does not replicate other efforts.  The WHI resource is unique in its scope, focus on diseases of older women, ethic and racial diversity, and in particular in that it includes several large randomized controlled clinical trials which are capable of yielding information that cannot be obtained from observational studies.  Care will be taken to ensure that the investigations under this BAA will not duplicate those already performed by the WHI investigators and their colleagues.

The original WHI study population included 161,808 postmenopausal women in the United States, 68,132 (42%) of whom were randomized to one or more components of the clinical trial (CT), and 93,676 (58%) of whom were enrolled in the observational study (OS) between 1993 and 1998.  Recruitment criteria included being 50-79 years of age, being post-menopausal, and planning to live in the area of a given Clinical Center (CC) for three years, with specific exclusionary criteria for the Dietary Modification (DM) and Hormone Therapy (HT) Trial components. Specific study goals were set for ethnic distribution (20% minority women in the CT) and age distribution (30% for 50-59 years of age; 45% for 60-69; 25% for 70-79).  The original cohort was followed until March 31, 2005, after which subjects were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study from 2005 to 2010. As of August 2006 there were 115,273 women (77% of eligibles) enrolled in the Extension Study, during which ascertainment of outcomes (including activities of daily life) has continued together with limited exposure data on use of hormone therapy, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and 24-hour recall of food intake (in a subset). 

ACQUISITION PLAN

This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals that will maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data in the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI), by soliciting the best ideas for laboratory-based research studies to apply to the WHI biologic resource.  This second solicitation follows on a first solicitation issued in January, 2006. That BAA solicitation resulted in the award of 12 contracts, each of a 2-year duration, awarded in January 2007. WHI collected extensive information on multiple outcomes, including any disease leading to overnight hospitalization, cancers, self-report of a number of additional conditions, measures of cognition/dementia, sleep, and functional status, amongst others. For this second BAA solicitation, proposals utilizing the data on any of the phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will be considered.  It is anticipated that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine.  The BAA will not fund new data collection and will make use of existing biologic specimens.

In general, the BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive, yet efficient, investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease. For example, genomic studies might include whole-genome and haplotype approaches and studies of sets of functional genes with related effects on an outcome.  Studies that combine information from genes and gene products in the form of blood proteins could help to elucidate pathways.  Studies on serum or plasma might include multiplex assays of a panel of markers, for example adipokines or cytokines, which allow a large number of markers to be tested using a modest amount of sample.  On the other hand, focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications. 

Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) are used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state-of-the art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific solution.  Proposals received under this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria as specified in the solicitation, through a peer review process.  Proposals will not be evaluated against a specific Government need, as in the case of a conventional request for proposals (RFP), as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.

In addition to the mechanism envisaged by this BAA, investigators may also gain access to the WHI data (including study data not related to the biologic resource) through an established ancillary study mechanism by collaborating with one or more WHI investigators.  A portion of the biologic resource not reserved for the BAA is otherwise reserved, and therefore studies that are not suitable for funding through the BAA may be proposed for funding through a variety of other mechanisms.  Such ancillary studies are reviewed by the relevant WHI committees and by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and if approved can be eligible for funding from NIH and non-NIH sources outside of the BAA.  Procedures for establishing collaboration can be found on www.whiscience.org. 

NHLBI anticipates awarding between 14 and 16 2-year contracts in mid January 2009. Awards will be made based on the weighted evaluation factors of technical merit, programmatic balance, and funds availability. It is anticipated that the individual award amounts will vary depending on the scope and capacity of the technical objectives for the award. For example, lower award costs may be made for more focused or limited investigations, and higher award costs may be for consortia proposing more comprehensive investigations. At the sole discretion of the NHLBI, meritorious proposal that cannot be funded within the amount currently available under this BAA may be forwarded to other National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutes for their consideration.

Cost reimbursement type contracts are planned for this acquisition because the programs being solicited will be basic research into highly technical areas of medical/scientific interest where there has been little work performed in the past.  It is expected that only minimal information concerning the specific requirements of the work will be provided by the government in the BAA.  It will be necessary for the contractors to develop their own research programs including research hypotheses and methods based on highly specialized knowledge and expertise.  The contractors will need to have considerable medical/scientific expertise in order to carry out the work to achieve the highly sophisticated research and technical objectives of the programs. 

EVALUATION PLAN

The primary basis for selecting proposals submitted in response to this BAA shall be technical excellence, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  The technical evaluation of proposals will be conducted through a peer review process in accordance with established criteria. The evaluation criteria shall evaluate the Offeror?s scientific and technical approach, adequacy of the technical approach, the Offerors? capabilities, and the qualifications, capabilities experience, and availability of proposed key personnel. NHLBI program and administrative staff will determine importance to agency programs and availability of funds.  In addition, past performance of the Offeror and the extent of small disadvantaged business concerns in performance of the program will also be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.304.

This sources sought announcement is published to notify the contracting community of this upcoming project and is meant to inform of its breadth and scope. This is NOT a request for proposals. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541710 e.g. Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. If your institution is a small business and would like to submit a capabilities statement to inform this office of how your business may fulfill some portion of this requirement, you are welcome to send two (2) copies thereof to this Office. Do not include budget information.

The contractor must have education, training, and experience relative to regulatory affairs for pharmaceuticals, biologics, and devices as they apply to the full range of biomedical research protocols conducted or managed by USAMRMC.  Specifical ly, the contractor must possess an in-depth knowledge of USAMRMC Special Projects and research protections implications thereof.  The base period of performance is 23 September 2007 to 22 September 2008, with four, one-year options.  USAMRAA intends to neg otiate a sole source contract for the continuation of services with AMDEX Corporation, 8403 Colesville Road, Suite 850, Silver Spring, MD  20910.  The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  This is a follow-on contract f or the provision of highly specialized services, and it is likely that award to any other source will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling  the agencys requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notific ation to the Contracting Officer within ten calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated capability within the established tim eframe.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at: USAMRAA, ATTN: MCMR-AAA-G (Brian Miller), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determinatio n by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, and the Milwaukee U.S. Export Assistance Center (USEAC) intend to issue a fixed price purchase order to the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), to supply all labor, material, and equipment for the construction of one (1) reception area, six (6) offices, one (1) conference room, and one (1) storage area within approximately 1,600 square feet within their building.  

The proposed acquisition is for services the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.   The DOC International Trade Administration (ITA)has entered into a Joint Project Agreement (JPA), with the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) to educate students and Wisconsin business owners on the benefits of international trade and to promote exposure to and experience in the world marketplace.  To facilitate this long-term agreement and working relationship, the Milwaukee U.S. Export Assistance Center is required to co-locate within the MSOE facility.  The MSOE has provided 1,601 square feet of space on the first floor of its five-floor structure for this purpose.   The facilities that MSOE is providing USEAC consist of unfinished open space with no existing walls or furniture.  To meet the needs of the USEAC, the space must be renovated.  Accomplishing these renovations will directly impact the mechanical, electrical, and heating, ventilating, and cooling (HVAC) systems, and potentially affect communications, security, and structural systems.   Because this is a secured facility, such activity will require identification and monitoring of all non-MSOE persons the entire time that they are present at the site.  The USEAC is not readily able to support such increased levels of technical intervention.  Keeping the renovation activity fully within MSOE control will eliminate all potential risks to DOC/NOAA of harm to MSOE personnel, students, structures, and systems throughout the duration of the project, and the potential long-term consequences of a construction error or omission on MSOE systems, programs, and property.

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) is planning to award a contract, on a sole source basis, to Ovid Technology, for a subscription to Ovid online databases including: Medline, CINAHL, the Annals of Internal Medicine, the Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins (LWW) Total Access Collection, the Ovid Premier Collection (which contains online, full text medical journals), the Clinical Choice Collection (which includes 42, online, full text books), the Slack Journal Collection and Janetti Publications (which includes online, full text medical journals) and Books@Ovid (which includes 20, online, full text medical books). This subscription is for the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago IL and is for the period Sept 1, 2007 through August 31, 2007, with two, one-year options to renew. This is considered to be a sole source because Ovid has the only database that provides access to all these resources through a single interface and that allows cross-database searching. Other companies who believe that they can provide these items and capabilities and meet the needs of the VA must provide information, to this office, about their products and capabilities by no later than 3:00 PM on Friday, August 24, 2007. This should also include at least three references to which the company has provided these same items. Please include customer name; name and phone number of contact person; identification of items sold; and inclusive dates when the items were sold to the customer. This is not a Request for Quotations and no solicitation documents are available at this time. The VA is first trying to determine if there are any sources, in addition to Ovid, for these items.

In an effort to improve safety and mission capability, the Apache Attack Helicopte r Project Office is seeking seat cushions from companies that have experience in manufacturing seat cushions for the Apache Attack Helicopter. REQUIREMENTS:  The candidate seat cushions must fit within the dimensions of the  existing Apache Helicopter seats, and must be able to function with the existing restraint system. Previously designed/proven packages are preferred.  The seat cushion must not interfere with the aircraft safety or adversely affect aircraft weight and bala nce limitations.  The U.S. Army seeks vendors to provide conceptual papers, design information, technology availability, design maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions, support requirements, prototypes, crashworthiness and environmental tes t data, and/or reliability data as related to their respective products.  Provide previous/current Government contract numbers as applicable, and a synopsis of previous/current work involving the AH-64A/D aircraft. Innovative ideas and solutions are strong ly encouraged. All interested sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest and qualifications involving the production of Apache seat by email to steven-cosgray@us.army.mil or to USAAMCOM, PEO Aviation, Apache Project Office, and  ATTN:  SFAE-AV-AAH-BP, Bldg 5681, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. Your responses are required by 10 September 2007. Submitted documentation upon delivery becomes the property of the U.S. Government. Submissions will not be returned. The submission of this inf ormation is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent - Sole Source - Software Engineering Support Services
<DESC>1.     The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a single source firm fixed price purchase order to procure professional technical services from CH2M. CH2M Hill has supported this project full time for over one year.  Personnel are developing a non-proprietary installation protection/command and control capability using unique programming skills which result in fusing disparate data (using the net-centric data strategy) from other proprietary and open source formats.  Personnel are experts with Air Force GeoBase program which provides underlying capability of the project. Without continuity by way of the contractor we will not be at a point of development in order to participate in the capabilities demonstration.  Without full capability for the demonstration, our pilot project may not get the necessary support to pursue becoming an AF program of record.  If a different contractor is selected, the full amount of this request would be spent before the new contractor could learn the requirements, data structures, or provide any value to the pilot project.    

2.     The duplication of effort and cost that would be incurred by switching to new contractor is not considered of benefit to the government.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 541690 and the size standard is $6.5M. All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.      

3.        Any company that feels they can meet the requirements as stated above without impact to the current operation of the Geospatial Technology Center must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 27 August 2007.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

4.     This procurement is for the acquisition of a sole source commercial item using simplified procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This office intends to award a contract by other than full and open competition in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.     5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,

PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for modified-commercial items prepared under FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information in this request.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and this announcement constitutes the solicitation request.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior on behalf of the U.S. Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM), Technical Division  THIS IS A SET-ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES.  NAICS CODE:  541512  / Size Standard:  $23 mil The U.S. Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM), Technical Division has a requirement for technical support in the successful development of the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) research and analysis to complete a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) that will culminate in a Squad Immersive Training Environment (SITE) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  The goal of SITE is fuse current, emerging, and future live and virtual technologies to create a fully immersive live/virtual training environment that:  1. Replicates as closely as possible the effects and conditions of the battlefield; and 2. Allows a dismounted infantry squad to effectively train in the wide spectrum of tasks necessary to execute the full ROMO.  This capability will build on the training value found in current simulations such as ISMT-E and laptop-based procedural trainers, serving as a supplement to live-fire exercises and also filling gaps that neither live nor virtual training can sufficiently address.  It will add realism through the replication of conditions and effects on the battlefield to create intense, stressful, challenging training scenarios that accelerate the decision-making cycle and provide instant, tangible feedback.  Combining live and virtual systems, it should be scalable and reconfigurable and with variable scenarios.  This analysis effort will review other programs such as the Deployable Virtual Training Environment (DVTE) which was designed to sustain the individual and unit critical war-fighting cognitive skills associated with the application of combined arms by the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) during "en-route" and deployed periods.  Another program, the USMC Live, Virtual, Constructive - Training Environment (LVC-TE) will provide expanded training and mission rehearsal capabilities that are a closer approximation of the true operational environment.  The LVC-TE will provide distributed training and facilitate joint war-fighting conditions through a networked system of interoperable training sites and deployable capabilities that thoroughly integrate personnel, doctrine, training and technology.   This analysis effort will leverage existing and emerging training technologies such as, but not limited to, weapons and marksmanship trainers such as the Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainer (ISMT), vehicle and crew-served gunnery training systems (PGTS, AAV-TT), tactical convoy simulation systems (VCCT, RVS, MPRI), indirect fire and forward air control simulation systems (CAN, I/FACT, MSAT, JTC-TRS), and command and control training simulations (CACCTUS, MTWS). ***The competitive Request for Quote (RFQ), specifications, RFQ amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement can be accessed via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/Solic/openmarket.asp under RFQ number 1406-04-07-RQ-68613.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Title: RESPONDENT DRIVEN SAMPLING ANALYSIS

C. 1 Background and Need

 The National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system was initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help state health departments establish and maintain a surveillance system to monitor selected behaviors and access to prevention services among groups at highest risk for HIV infection. Findings from NHBS will be used to enhance understanding of risk and testing behaviors, and to develop and evaluate HIV prevention programs.

NHBS activities are implemented in rotating cycles.  During the first cycle of data collection (December 2003 - December 2004), surveillance activities focused on men who have sex with men (MSM).  The focus of the second cycle (January 2005 - February 2006) was on injecting drug users (IDUs). The third cycle (March 2006 - October 2007) focuses on surveillance activities on heterosexuals at high risk of HIV infection (HET). These cycles will be repeated over time such that data are collected from any given risk group every three years.  Each cycle is referred to by the group of interest: NHBS-MSM; NHBS-IDU; NHBS-HET. 

For NHBS-IDU and NHBS-HET cycles, Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) was used to recruit injecting drug users and heterosexuals at high risk of HIV infection for surveillance data collection.  RDS starts with a limited number of peers, known as seeds, who usually are chosen by referral from key informants or through outreach.  These seeds then recruit their peers into the study, who in turn, recruit their peers. For analysis of data collected using RDS, the recruiters must be linked to their recruits. These data must then be weighted to adjust for network size of the respondents and to control for bias associated with the RDS peer-driven recruitment process. In addition, because NHBS-IDU data were collected in 23 cities in the United States, these weighted estimates must be aggregated to produce a single estimate for the overall NHBS data.  

C.2 Project Objective

The RDS Analysis Tool (RDSAT) is an analysis software program designed specifically to analyze data collected via RDS. Although RDS is being used more widely for public health research and surveillance, there is limited expertise in the scientific community in analyzing and interpreting data in RDSAT. To meet the goals of NHBS, surveillance reports and scientific papers must be developed and disseminated in a timely manner to provide needed information for HIV prevention and policy planning.  Due to the lack of capacity in RDSAT analysis at CDC, these services must be purchased.  

C.3 Scope of Work

The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain services for conducting analysis of NHBS-IDU data in RDSAT.

NHBS-IDU data were collected under the CDC HIV/AIDS surveillance programs security and confidentiality guidelines.  Due to these data security requirements for HIV/AIDS surveillance data, the work described in this task shall be performed during normal business hours at the CDC/National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention/Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention/Behavioral and Clinical Surveillance Branch located in Atlanta, Georgia. The contractor must be willing to reside in the metropolitan Atlanta area during the period of performance at their own expense.  The CDC will not reimburse the contractor for moving expenses. The period of performance will be six months from the date of award.


C.4 Technical Requirements

The Contractor shall as an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, furnish all the necessary services and qualified personnel, to perform the following contract requirements.

The vendor shall provide a project plan that encompasses the RDSAT analysis of NHBS-IDU data.  During the initial project meeting, the vendor and CDC BST will review the proposed plan and make modifications as necessary.  This plan will be put into practice for the remainder of the task.  As part of the proposed plan, the vendor shall be trained in and abide by all data security and confidentiality requirements.  

The tasks specified will require demonstrated knowledge and experience in:
1) RDS theory and methods; 
2) Conducting analysis using RDSAT, including interpretation and reporting of RDS findings.
3) The most recent RDSAT version, features and technology.

Task 1   Develop a plan for analyzing the NHBS-IDU data using RDSAT, including quality assurance checks and documentation of analysis procedures.

The contractor shall:

A.  Identify a means for documenting analysis procedures in RDSAT, which is point-and-click software.
B.  Develop a written analysis plan that describes methods for achieving the objectives of each report or manuscript.
C.  Assess sources of bias in the NHBS-IDU data related to the key outcomes of the analysis. Provide a written summary of significant problems with bias.
D.  Develop a detailed, written quality assurance plan for the data analysis. This plan should include, but is not limited to, a description of checks for each sample (there will be a minimum of 23 samples and possibly more than 1 sample per city) and each outcome variable (both population proportions and prevalence estimates) per sample. 

Task 2  Analyze NHBS-IDU data using RDSAT and calculate aggregate estimates.

The contractor shall:
A. Conduct analyses to populate table shells and run other analyses as needed.
B. Produce written documentation of analysis procedures that were used.
C. Produce written documentation quality assurance checks that were done and how problems were resolved.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service  		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor) (a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.  	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm . 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.  	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.  	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings. Quotes are due August 31, 2007; quotes may be faxed to 801-524-3857. For information contact Denise Westenskow at 801-524-3876.

Brand Name Justification:

FINDINGS

1.  The canopies were included in the original order for the trucks they are going on.  Warner Robins ALC made a mistake and the canopies did not come with the service bodies. Warner Robins ALC gave the customer the funds to correct the mistake and get the needed canopies.

2.  In accordance with (IAW) 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.  To ensure proper form, fit, and function it would be best to match the current Knapheide truck bodies with the corresponding Knapheide canopy roof. If a different vendor is used the new canopies may not fit or perform as required. Using any other canopy than Knapheide on a Knapheide service body will void the warranty.

3.  IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for "brand name" only. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the above findings it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of Knapheide Truck Service Body Canopies is in the best interest of the Government.

c. Three desk stations will be installed, two at the reception desk and one in the director?s office.
d. The stations located at the front desk and in the director?s office should have handset options to allow for privacy of conversations.
e. The classroom units should have volume control capability as well as handset options that allow for privacy of conversations.
f. The master station (central controller) should be mounted at or near the current intercom as this is where the existing intercom cabling is terminated.
g. Where possible, and if in good condition, the contractor will reuse the existing cable for all new intercom stations.  New cable will be used in situations where the existing cable is damaged or otherwise not usable.
h. The contractor will be responsible for removing the old system for the purpose of installing the replacement system.

    (a) Prohibitions.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-07-R-010057 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only. This is a request for proposal (RFP).  NAICS code: 332999 Size standard: 500.  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17. This requirement is restricted to SMALL BUSINESSES.  
This synopsis/solicitation is issued for the acquisition of products variously called work stands, inspection stands, and work platforms which will be used on the United States Coast Guard's HC-144 aircraft.  The commercial version of this aircraft is the CASA CN235-300M aircraft.  The USCG can not provide blueprints, drawings, dimensions, or specification of the aircraft or any components.  Interested offerors will be given a chance to view the aircraft and take measurements and photos on 11 July 2007 at 10:00am.  This will be the only date and time offered.  Interested offerors will need to contact CWO Dorsey Johr by e-mail at Dorsey.H.Johr@USCG.mil. Please provide name, nationality, place of birth, and point of contact details to CWO Johr no less then 1 day prior to arriving at the base.
The Governments objective is to obtain products, variously called work/check stands, inspection stands, and work platforms.  The stands must be easy to move and transportable from the hanger to the flight-line.  The stands will be used for CASA CN235-300M aircraft in performing inspections and operator level maintenance in both a hanger environment and outside on the flight line.  Stands must be durable, stable, and weather resistant because they may be used inside a hanger environment or outside on the flight line.  The majority of use of the stands is anticipated to be for operator inspection and maintenance purposes within a hanger; however, the stands may be routinely stored outside. Stands should require a maximum of 3 personnel to move using wheels to ease the effort.  Stands must be specifically built to the airframe dimensions of the CN235-300M aircraft, i.e.: wing height, engine/prop height/width, and horizontal/vertical stabilizer height/width, and fuselage to landing gear sponson interface. The USCG is not looking for universal or multiple use check stands, i.e. B1, B4A, and etc. however the USCG anticipates the stands will be similar.  Stands should be free from sharp edges, burrs and other hazards that could harm or damage aircraft or personnel.  Stands must have protective padding to protect aircraft where contact between the stand and the aircraft are likely to occur.  Stands should have platforms which allow a minimum of 2 average sized people (180 pounds) to stand on the platform at one time.  Stands need not provide for utility connections such as electric or air.  Stands should have locking wheels and potentially could be offered with mechanism for adjustments to account for uneven surfaces.  Coverage of the various stands should include, and allow work to be performed in/on, props, engine, nose and cockpit window area, flap area top/bottom, horizontal stabilizer top/bottom, wing area top/bottom, and the top of the fuselage.  Access to the full height of the vertical stabilizer will not be required.  It is envisioned that offerors will propose a system of various individual stands covering one or more areas of the aircraft aimed primarily at operator-type maintenance, as opposed to one single stand used more traditionally for depot level work.  After the USCG gains additional operational and maintenance experience will be to buy an unknown number of the various individual stands for specific areas of the plane.  Additionally, if the contractor offers a propeller stand for use with the Hamilton Sundstrand 14 RF-37, the Government will consider purchasing that stand as a separate option.  All stands must meet applicable OSHA standards and (American welding Society) AWS standards for soundness and safety.  The desired delivery date from time of award is 50 days after placement of each order including the initial order; however, the Government will consider other delivery times.  The Government can not provide specifications, plans, drawings, or other technical data.  Limited data can be found at: http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nifc/aviation/smokejumper.Par.31323.File.dat/CN235Report.pdf   Note that the Government does not warrant the accuracy of any data contained in these internet links.
--Contract period: This contract will have a base period with 5 option periods.  The BASE PERIOD will be date of contract award through the following SIX-MONTH period; OPTION PERIOD ONE will be the one-year period following the base period; OPTION PERIOD TWO will be the one-year period following the first option; OPTION PERIOD THREE will be the one-year period following the second option; OPTION PERIOD FOUR will be the one-year period following the third option; OPTION PERIOD FIVE will be the six-month period following the fourth option.
--CLIN Structure for proposals:   Offeror's proposal should list each separate section of the maintenance stands as a separate CLIN. Additionally, if the Offeror produces a propeller stand for use with the Hamilton Sundstrand 14 RF-37, this CLIN should be listed as optional and not part of the complete system.  The base should have CLINS starting in 01, option year one should start with 02, option year two should start with 03, option year three should start with 04, option year four should start with 05, and the last option should start with 06.  Each portion of the stand and any optional stand offered should then be sequentially numbered within the appropriate period.  The following CLIN structure is for example purposes only:  Base year: 01002 Wheel Stand, 01002 Nose Stand, 01003 Optional Propeller stand.  For the first option year: 02001 Wheel Stand, 02002 Nose Stand, 02003 Optional propeller stand.  All quantities listed should be for the quantity of 1 each.  If more then one stand of a particular type is needed for the complete set due to design or interconnection, this should be clearly identified in the proposal.  An example of this might be an engine platform stand where a specific maintenance stand is needed for the port engine and a different maintenance stand is needed for the starboard engine of the aircraft.  Prices offered should be FOB origin, freight prepaid to the addresses shown below.  All prices will be firm-fixed prices for the base and all option periods.
--Purchase quantities are as follows:  The USCG estimates buying a total of 6 complete sets and estimates no more then 35 of any one separate sections over the life of this contract and any exercised options.  The USCG will buy two complete sets, defined as one of each section, during the base period at time of award.  Orders for additional sets or individual sections will be placed by delivery order during the base period or any exercised options as needs develop.  Additional quantities are estimates only; failure of the government to order any of the items described as estimated shall not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment.  It is anticipated that the USCG will eventually acquire a total of 35+ of the CASA aircraft.
--Inspection and acceptance shall be performed in accordance with FAR 52.212-4 by DCMC.  Purchased stands will be shipped to the addresses specified in each delivery order.  The first of the two sets purchased during the base period will be sent to USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Attn: Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001.  POC Dorsey Johr at 252-334-5115.  The second set will be shipped to CASA HC-144A Maintenance Officer, USCG Aviation Training Center, 8501 Tanner Williams Rd., Mobile, AL  36608.  POC for mobile is CWO3 Ken Hardenbrook 251-441-5070.  Delivery is desired within 50 days after receipt of contract and any additional delivery orders. Actual required date will be stated in the final contact based on the proposal selected.  FOB point shall be origin, freight prepaid.  Reimbursable Transportation: Material shall be delivered FOB suppliers plant with shipment to be made to destination(s) subject to reimbursement.  The transportation cost is to be shown on the invoice as a separate item.  If shipping charges exceed $100.00, the charge must be supported by a freight bill.  All shipments will be freight prepaid.  Packaging of the items for shipment shall be in accordance with the Contractor's best commercial practices IAW MIL-STD 20731D(1) with the following exceptions:  Each item shall be labeled on the outside with , Part Number, Nomenclature, Delivery Order Number, and Line Item.  Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material:  popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging.
--Contractor's standard commercial warranty shall apply.  IAW FAR 46.706(b)(5), any offered warranty must be disclosed; as a minimum disclosure must include a brief statement that a warranty exists, the substance of the warranty, the warranty?s duration, and whom to notify if the items are found to be defective.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(End of provision)
--NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593 Telephone:(202)372-3692 Fax:(202)475-3904

<DESC>Amendment 03 for Media Blaster GPC071TWCF319MXG

This Amendment is provided for information only.

Question: In the Original Solicitation it states a requirement for a two gallon tumble basket that mounts to the door.  After contacting Clemco, I found that the tumble basket cannot be mounted to the door with the vertical lifting doors.  What should I do? 

Answer: An alternate option is available.  Having the tumble basket not connected but still an accessory would be acceptable for the Pulsar V1- P # 21639.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged, to include the date of reciept of quotes.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health Department of Network Applications intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Soft Computer Consultants, 5400 Tech Data Drive, Clearwater, FL. 33760. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ93622-1 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519. The purpose of this Contract is to purchase replacement servers and software for the Soft System which is the Laboratory Information System. The mission of the Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is to guide the appropriate use of information technology to enhance clinical research, patient care, and hospital management.  DCRI is responsible for the infrastructure that supports the technology for all mainframe, client-server, desktop computers and its accompanying application management/development, database information.   DCRI provides technical advice and supports the NIH/CC and the new Clinical Research Center (CRC) through the operations, development and management of administrative and business software applications while supporting as many as 4,500 users. DCRI supports the Laboratory Information System (LIS) which is made up of several modules from Soft Computer some of the modules include SoftLab, SoftBank, SoftMic, and SoftPath. The LIS system supports the functions of the CC Laboratory, Blood Bank, and Pathology departments. Clinical Orders are entered in Eclipsys Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM) and are HL7 interfaced to LIS and results from LIS are interfaced back into SCM. This system must be operational 24x7x365 as its providing a fundamental process for clinical care. 
 
The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain hardware, software, an implementation services to upgrade the existing Soft Computer modules from DB Vista to the Oracle based database version. In addition, the current hardware supporting LIS has reached end of life (EOL) and requires replacement.

SPECIFIC TASKS
Task Area 1 ? Hardware

Please provide a quotation for the hardware and licenses listed in Attachment 1. Please submit quote using the provided spreadsheet format. Email amcgee@cc.nih.gov for Attachment 1.

Task Area 2 ? Hardware Integration

Please provide a quotation for the hardware prep work, installation, system configuration. Please include estimated travel expenses.  

Task Area 3 ? Oracle Database Conversion 

Please provide a quotation for the tasks listed below: 

Initial database installation and setup
Engineers will install and configure DBMS software and database to provide for both uninterrupted 24x7 database service and top database performance. Particular database deployment depends on the client's hardware configuration, business needs and installed applications. Engineers will also create and configure standby or replicated databases for dual systems configurations, setup database backup, configure automatic database maintenance and performance gathering scripts and perform initial database performance tuning.

Database upgrades
From time to time, database management software and underlying database needs to be upgraded to resolve critical bugs or because previous DBMS version becomes de-supported (Expected lifetime of database software is currently 2 to 3 years). Database upgrade is often required as well when application code is upgraded to support new functionality. 
Engineers must have all the necessary knowledge to perform database upgrades for db_VISTA (RDM), ORACLE database engines and they will make sure that the database version transition goes fast and smooth.

Ongoing database maintenance
Create and prepare the database(s) for test or upgrade system, load or unload data to/from the database, initialize database in full or only certain areas (i.e. patient data only).

Database monitoring
Database monitoring can detect problems before they become critical, identify performance bottlenecks and warn about possible inconsistencies in the database, system or software. 

Problem determination and resolution
Databases may fail or experience errors due to a number of reasons, including power fluctuations, system crash, hardware failures, bug in a software or a user error. Problem determination and resolution, thus, requires the person to be the expert in a number of fields, including system administration and engineering, database administration and LIS software. 
Critical performance problems ("deadlocks", "lock ups", or "very slow system" events) can often be resolved "on the fly" to minimize client's downtime and adverse effects of slowdown.

Database backup, recovery and failover.
It is essential that patient data is protected and recoverable should the disaster strike. Engineers will create and set up backup configuration, adjusted to our hardware architecture and requirements. 
Database backups monitoring and verification is a cooperative effort between engineers and the client, DCRI will check their database backup daily and report any failures to engineers  to make sure database is continuously recoverable.
Although backups are normally performed as automatic or semi-automatic jobs, recovery is a complex process, which requires significant knowledge of database engine and is usually a manual process, performed by domain expert.
For dual systems configurations, database operations can be fail overed to the auxiliary system, if the primary system fails.
Database administrators are trained and certified in database backup and recovery and database failover.
Database performance tuning

Performance of applications depends to a large degree on a performance of the database. Properly configured and tuned database can increase database through output and reduce average wait times several times, compared to an untuned one on the same hardware. Engineers will collect and analyze database performance statistics over representative time period and perform necessary adjustments to database(s), based on the current workload, underlying system configuration and business needs. 
Conduct periodic workload analysis and adjustments are necessary to make sure database is running on peak efficiency.


Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Government Furnished Information:

The government will provide the contractor with the necessary facilities to support task completion, including desktop computers, software and network services.

<CONTACT>Linda Baier, Contracting Officer, Phone 202 551 7315, Fax 703 914 9226, Email baierl@sec.gov
<DESC>Q&A:
The following questions have been received; the answers follow each question.  The questions are divided into two groups:  technical and administrative.  Technical questions refer to requirements of Section C and administrative questions refer to preparation of the proposals.

TECHNICAL: 

1. Attachment 4, Item 1: would all filers have the same initial configuration and/or permissions when we create the account?  
Answer:   YES [not sure of your meaning of ?initial configuration?; everyone will have same approval process to obtain password to file and once permission is granted, every ?Filer? will have same access].
2.  Attachment 4, Item 3: what is meant by "prepare document for submission"?  What is the requirement of the ASP in this step?  Are there some unique requirements?
Answer: The Filer must ensure that the document meets the specifications in the Commission?s Rules of Practice, such as word count limits, formatting requirements, and signature requirements (which are currently applicable to these paper filings).  There is not an ASP requirement in this step.   
3.  Attachment 4, Item 5: what is meant by "submit the document to the docket" if the documents are forwarded to an administrator for further review/posting?  Is there just one docket to which documents are submitted to?
Answer:   A document will be entered into the Docket after review by the SEC Administrators.  Thus, the Filer submits the document to the SEC Administrators; then the SEC Administrators submit the document to the Docket.  There is a docket for each administrative action; for example, in 2006, the Commission had approximately 271 administrative proceedings; therefore, there would be a docket of pleadings filed in each administrative proceeding (e.g., 271 dockets).  
4. Attachment 4, Item 6: should all users be able to see docs successfully posted to the docket?
Answer:   YES, all users AND all members of the public should be able to see all documents posted to each Docket, which can be maintained by the vendor, but available on the SEC?s website, via a SEC website link to the Docket, EXCEPT those documents filed under seal would not be visible to all users and the public (see Question #9).  
5.  Attachment 4, Item 6: will Administrators simultaneously post to sec.gov site, or is that a requirement of the system?
Answer:   See answer above in Question No. 4.
6.  Attachment 4, Item 6: what happens to a document if it is not approved for the docket?  Who are making those decisions, or is it expected that the ASP will be able to qualify by rules?
Answer:   If the SEC Administrator does not approve the document to be submitted to the docket, then the system should return the document to the Filer with a personalized message from the SEC Administrator that the documents did not satisfy the requirements for filing.  The system should retain a record of the returned documents. 
7.  Attachment 4, Items 7, 10, 12, and 13: how are parties to the pleading (litigant, filer, administrators, etc) identified when the document is uploaded/submitted?
Answer: The ?Filer? is the person or party submitting (or uploading) the document, so that person is self-identified.  ?Litigants? and ?SEC Administrators? are identified to the system when they are registered.  ?Litigants? are all the parties in the administrative proceeding.  ?SEC Administrators? are the SEC Office of Secretary staff who review the filing upon receipt from the Litigant before it is submitted to the Docket.  
8.  Attachment 4, Item 8: can the administrator manually identify the parties to be served?
Answer:   If a person has not registered as a ?Litigant? in the proceeding via the system, the SEC Administrator would like the capability to manually add a person or party to be served, when the SEC Administrator determines that a person or party should receive copies of the filings.
9.  Attachment 4, Item 14:  please confirm that documents under seal should not be accessible by anyone except internal SEC users and the filer.
Answer:   When a document is filed under seal by the Filer, the SEC Administrator will not release the document to the Docket until an Order from the Administrative Law Judge (?ALJ?) or Commission is received either permitting the Filer to file the document under seal or not permitting such filing under seal.  As an added precaution, any actions performed under seal should require confirmation in the system and flagged as being filed under seal.  Once the ALJ or Commission Order specifies who should be given access to the document filed under seal (and all appeals of this Order are exhausted), the SEC Administrator should be able to manually add the parties who should be given access to the document.
10. Attachment 4, Item 14: will more than one user ever need access to the same sealed doc set (ie party and counsel)?    
Answer:   On a sealed document, more than one party can have access to the sealed document, depending on the ALJ (or Commission?s) Order.  (However, for any access to the system, if a party is represented by counsel, only counsel should have access to the system).
11.  Would any counsel need access to documents submitted on behalf of more than 1 party?
Answer:   YES.
12.  Is there a requirement to provide electronic notary services or other types of certificates, etc.?
Answer:   It is not a requirement for the system to provide electronic notary services (or other types of certificates), but this feature would be considered an added benefit. (Filers should be able to submit pdf exhibits to filings that contain notary signatures).
13.  Can the SEC clarify what is meant by ?ad hoc? reports, as discussed in section C.3.8.3 in the Solicitation? 
Answer:   Ad hoc reporting is the ability to generate reports outside of the specified reports that the system can run.  We currently use Crystal Reports and Business Objects to run such ad hoc reports. 
14.  Please explain the requirement in section C.3.8.3 that states: ?Contractor will partition server so SEC ad hoc reporting function only queries SEC data.? 
Answer:  The system should not query the Contractor?s entire database, which includes non-SEC data.   
15.  Can the SEC specify what type of statistics the Contractor is expected to collect regarding users? (see Solicitation C.3.1.6) 
Answer:   We would want certain critical information about the filings submitted; for example, their dates of submission, the number of submissions, the types of submissions, the disposition of submissions, hearings, pending motions and initial decisions, guideline dates in 17 CFR ?201.900(a) for timely completion of proceedings, time frames specified in 17 CFR ? 201.360(a)(2), pending motions, and statistics regarding a Judges? workload.
16.  Can the SEC describe the amount of detail required for audit trails? (see Solicitation C.3.6.1.11). 
Answer:   We want a record of submission , such as who submitted the document, date of submission, file name and number, whether the submission was sealed or not, whether the submission was returned by the SEC Administrator, the number of attachments or exhibits to the submission, etc. 
17.  Please describe the types of ?parties? who file into SEC administrative proceedings? (i.e.: Are the majority of filers attorneys or pro-se litigants?) 
Answer:  The majority of the Filers will be attorneys. 
18.  Please clarify the following requirement: ?The system shall generate an electronically available docket on the SEC public website making documents in administrative proceedings available to the public over the internet.? (see Solicitation C.1.0). Does the SEC require that Contractor generate the docket directly on the SEC public website, or that the docket be available to be placed onto the SEC public website? 
Answer:   See Answer to Question No. 4.
19.  At which stage in the e-filing process does the SEC require word count capabilities? 
Answer:   The SEC requires a word count capability when the Filer files the document (but this capability is only for the filing, attached exhibits).
20.  Would the SEC be opposed to different methods of storing data outside of storing the data on a compact disk (CD)? (see Solicitation 3.7.2) 
Answer:   Perhaps ? we would have to know what the method is.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

1.  Will the SEC accept, review, and answer additional vendor questions regarding the Solicitation after August 17, 2007? 
Answer:   No.
2.  Would the SEC be willing to extend the current August 29, 2007 Solicitation response deadline? 
Answer:   No.
