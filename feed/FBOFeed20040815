<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) in Marathon FL, requires services for the development of an Early Warning System (EWS) reference Coral Bleaching in the FKNMS. Coral bleaching is a stress condition in reef corals that involves a breakdown of the symbiotic relationship between corals and unicellular algae.  These microscopic plants live within the coral tissue and provide the coral with food for growth and their normal healthy color.  Affecting corals during the warm summer months, the symptoms of bleaching include a gradual loss of color as their algae are expelled from the coral tissue, sometimes leaving corals bones white.  The intention of this requirement is to develop and implement an EWS to predict the onset of mass coral bleaching.  The information will allow managers to better assess, communicate , and respond to mass bleaching events.  The EWS will consist of three elements designed to detect each of these states:  climate monitoring, sea temperature monitoring and volunteer observations.  The contractor will work with the FKNMS Superintendent, the Science Coordinator , and the NMS Coral Reef Policy Specialist.  Task I Monitoring Environmental Conditions includes identifying sources; coordination with data providers; identifying coral bleaching threshold sea surface temperatures for representative reef regions.  The deliverables are sea surface temperature graphs and current condition reports.  Task II Using volunteers to provide early warning of coral bleaching by promoting volunteer reports, developing and implementing a dedicated volunteer monitoring network.  Deliverables include providing volunteer monitoring data, developing training materials, disseminating program information, providing volunteer training.  Task III develop the Early Warning Chapter of the FKNMS Bleaching Response Plan.  Task IV Coordinate the participate of relevant technical experts involved in the development and implementation of the FKNMS Bleaching Response Plan.
The period of performance is 12-months from the date of award with an option for one and possibly two additional 12-month periods.  Quotes will be evaluated using the following criteria:  demonstrated experience managing volunteer monitoring programs in collecting observations on extreme events in the FKNMS; Knowledge of the Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem; Knowledge of the existing relevant research in the Florida Keys; Demonstrated scientific expertise for data syntheses and interpretation relevant to coral bleaching or other episodic events; Familiarity with appropriate environmental data sets and the individuals and organizations that collect these data sets; Accredited scientific institution; Resides locally during the entire contract period.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) , Habitat Conservation Division, Caribbean Field Office in Boqueron Puerto Rico, has a requirement for identifying coral reef areas in Puerto Rico.  The purpose of this project is to strengthen existing marine protected areas and enhance the marine protected area in Puerto Rico in support of local efforts to protect and conserve coral reefs.  The work will support Puerto Rico’s Chamber Resolution 207, which mandates the protection of 3 percent of the insular platform of Puerto Rico in response to the National Action Plan. This project builds on ongoing efforts of NOAA Fisheries in Puerto Rico to strengthen existing marine protected areas and create new ones and addresses management needs identified by the Department and Environmental Resources (DNER).  The project is initiated as a component of the NMFS efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998. In order to meet the objective of the work under any resultant contract, the contractor shall complete three tasks.  Task I:  The contractor shall perform a thorough review of scientific publications, university publications and surveys and gray literature related to studies and observations of the condition of coral reefs and coralline communities and changes in these characteristics over time.  The contractor shall examine information that shall include but not be limited to surveys by university professors and investigators, DNER and Puerto Rico Sea Grant College Programs.  Task II:  Field Surveys shall be conducted at selected sites to be determined by the contractor in coordination with NOAA Fisheries, DNER, the Caribbean Fishery Management Council and other interested parities.  The sites will be decided upon during two stakeholder meetings to be conducted upon completion of Task I, Literature Review.  In Task III, the contractor shall prepare a final report for the project that contains a summary of the results of the first two tasks as well as recommendations regarding coral areas in need of protection either due to their relatively pristine condition or do to stresses they are experiencing, such as sedimentation or overuse. It will be the contractors responsibility to acquire permission for use of copyrighted material as necessary for the compilation information regarding the status of the Puerto Rico corals.  The project is scheduled to be complete within 12-months from the official start date.
