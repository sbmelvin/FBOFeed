<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the National Rural Health Association (NRHA), Kansas City, Missouri.  This contract will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  The anticipated contract life is for a twelve (12) month base period with two (2) twelve (12) month option years.  The NRHA is a national membership organization, whose mission is to improve the health and health care of rural Americans and to provide leadership on rural issues through 1) advocacy, 2) communications, 3) education and 4) research.  The NRHA is uniquely capable of providing these four necessary skill areas along with the pre-existing organizational relationships with State Rural Health Associations (SRHA) and State Offices of Rural Health (SORH).  This combination makes the NHRA the only organization that can immediately provide meaningful technical assistance to a wide range of rural stakeholders and fulfill the requirements of this contract. Award of a contract to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government since that organization would need to attain the necessary skills, capabilities, and organization relationships needed for this requirement.  This is not a solicitation but an announcement of the Government’s intent to contract.  The purpose of this contract is to provide technical assistance to the SRHAs and the SORHs as these organizations continue their efforts to provide and improve health care services for rural Americans.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

Mr. Ward has developed and is sole owner of proprietary groundwater models which were used in a Reclamation sponsored study entitled the Hopi Western Navajo Water Supply Study (HWNWSS).  The results and data developed under the HWNWSS have been sealed by the Bureau of Reclamation since the study and results could have direct impact on the ongoing Little Colorado Water Rights Adjudication.  The C-Aquifer study is directly related to the HWNWSS because there currently exists the potential for closure of both the Black Mesa Peabody Coal Mine and the Mohave Generation Station because groundwater sources currently supplying water to these entities will no longer be available after December 2005.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides air traffic control services over large parts of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. In 1995, the FAA developed and deployed an Oceanic Data Link (ODL) system that provides among other functions, direct communications between Controllers and Pilots using communication protocols collectively known as Future Air Navigation System Controller/Pilot Datalink Communication (FANS-1/A CPDLC).  The ODL system also provides digital communications with the Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC) High Frequency (HF) Radio Operator (RO).  The ODL system is currently installed at the FAA Oakland and New York Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). A similar system is deployed at the FAA Anchorage ARTCC.  The FAA is in the process of replacing the ODL system with the Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) system. The FAA will be transitioning from ODL to ATOP over the next 18 months, which is an extremely complicated undertaking.  The ODL and ATOP FANS-1/A communication services are currently provided by SITA under a five-year contract that was awarded in 1999. The following bullets provide the FAA requirements for the Oceanic Data link service: 1. Potential vendors must be currently interfaced to the FAA's National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet Switched Network (PSN), including the NADIN PSN test facility located at the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC); 2. Potential vendors must currently be providing FANS-1/A telecommunication services in FAA controlled airspace over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; 3. Potential vendors must be able to provide FANS-1/A telecommunication services to FANS-1/A avionics testbeds (e.g. the Boeing 747 or 777 test bench); 4. Potential vendors must have a demonstrated technical expertise in the provision and maintenance of telecommunications networks used in the provision of air traffic services. Interested companies that believe they have the technical and administrative capability to fulfill the requirements herein shall respond with their capability statement not later than June 09, 2004. Respondents must include their proven capability of working with a technically equivalent system in a similar environment and a proven record of providing timely and efficient technically equivalent system support.  It is requested that written responses include telephone number for point of contact, show that the firm has the necessary technical skills, qualified personnel, experience and past performance in similar work; and state the purpose of interest, i.e, prime contractor, subcontractor or information only. This public announcement is not a request for proposal.

The approved equipment already purchased to display the video is manufactured by SMART technologies, which is compatible with SMART’s prototype software.  This supporting video equipment will allow synchronization of multiple video streams to be displayed in thumbnail or enlarged format on SMART display boards.  The required items will be delivered to and installed in flight briefing rooms at Luke AFB, Arizona.   Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  Audio Video Resources is the only factory authorized installer in Arizona.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.

If no response is received by Noon, MDT, June 1, 2004 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with AVAZ Inc a sole source award will be made.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Government to award a sole source contract to EG&G Technical Services, Inc., Albuquerque, NM. This is a development effort to continue design of the Personal Identification Credential System
(PICS) handheld unit in order to reduce the ultimate production cost. The existing PICS engineering prototype units, approximately credit card size with a .66-inch thickness, provide a biometric fingerprint sensor allowing the authentication of personal identification. This personal identification is sent via an encrypted RF signal, over a distance up to 60 ft, to an access control system. Each encased PICS unit is composed of a biometric fingerprint sensor, a processor, a battery and a RF transceiver. All components used are COTS. The PICS handheld unit interfaces with the existing PICS Enrollment Station (allows individual
fingerprint(s) registration and data updating) and the PICS Reader (accepts and interfaces the PICS RF signal at the access control location). This development will redesign the PICS handheld units size at 3.5”L x 2.25”W x 0.66”H threshold (with a goal to reduce thickness to 0.5” or less.  EG&G has gone through two generations of prototype development of the handheld PICS unit. This development phase will deliver a minimum of 200 handheld PICS units.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for com petitive proposals. Information received within 15 days of publication will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note 26.  Points of contact are: Roy Higgins, POC, 781-377-5657, roy.higgins@hanscom.af.mil and Capt Aaron Boyd, Contracting Officer, 781-377-2267.

Analysis of this data is crucial, as the size and diversity of the racial/ethnic groups in the CHIS-CAM sample will help NCI to ascertain use of CAM among racial/ethnic minority populations that are insufficiently represented in current national surveys.  Analyses will be conducted to examine the main questions of interest.   These include: 1) Overall CAM usage; 2) CAM usage among those with cancer; and 3) Predictors of CAM usage related to demographics, socioeconomic status, health care access and use, and cultural characteristics.   Regents of the University of Los Angeles, is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the unique personnel required in order to continue this service.  
UCLA Dr. Michael S. Goldstein and his collaborators whom have access to the analyses of the data require and have specific knowledge of the CHIS-CAM data.  The UCLA team designed the CHIS-CAM study and collected the data.  In addition, the UCLA group of investigators has in-depth understanding of the CHIS 2001 survey, which was used as the basis for the sample for the CHIS-CAM study.  Therefore, this group has unique understanding and access to the CHIS-CAM data and is uniquely qualified to perform these analyses.  UCLA has a copyright on the CHIS-CAM data. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, June 8, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40066-NG.

The data will help clarify the understanding of transport through waste and if landfill gas is a potential pathway for these contaminants to be released to the environment.  These data will be used to help those making decisions on how to best manage BDR to ensure protection of landfill workers and the surrounding community and ecosystems. Existing laboratory-scale reactors, which were designed and utilized to evaluate the anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable components in a simulated landfill,  will be used to simulate anaerobic conditions within a landfill and to evaluate/validate equilibrium models for chemical contaminants and the mechanisms controlling transport and fate of biological contaminants using surrogates.  Use of  the existing equipment will allow the study to be completed more expeditiously and at a lower cost to the Government.  There will NOT be an RFP issued as a result of this synopsis.  Organizations that feel they can meet EPA's requirements must submit supporting documentation no later than ten days after posting of this synopsis.  Documentation shall be sent to U.S. EPA, Cincinnati, OH 45268 or can be submitted electronically to hennessey.mike@epa.gov

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism of Azerbaijan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism- Azerbaijan  :  The Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism (Ministry) of Azerbaijan invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on developing a tourism strategy.  The technical assistance will include assistance with policy, regulatory, and budgetary planning, revising the current tourism master plan, institutional capacity building, development of research and data collection capabilities, developing a marketing plan, and an economic impact analysis.

The Government of Azerbaijan has identified tourism as a priority sector as it attempts to diversify its economy and address the challenges of poverty reduction. Azerbaijan is attracting many foreign oil and gas companies and seeing revenues from that aspect of the economy, and would like to develop its potential to become a regional tourist hub to attract oil and gas workers, and Western Europeans on extended weekends.  Azerbaijan has an enviable seaside location, as well as mountains and lakes, and possesses numerous cultural attractions, including medieval architecture, castles, and caravanserais.

Despite its recent economic growth, Azerbaijan’s infrastructure remains underdeveloped.  Beyond Baku, tourism infrastructure has yet to be properly capitalized.  The Government of Azerbaijan has begun to address the many challenges of tourism development, for example, by joining the World Tourism Organization (a United Nations agency dedicated to assisting countries with maximizing the economic benefits of tourism) and gave the tourism sector ministry-level attention by creating the Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism in 2002.  The World Tourism Organization visited Azerbaijan in 2002 to conduct a detailed technical assistance mission that focused on tourism marketing, and a broad master plan was proposed.   However, before any marketing or other plans can be implemented, it is necessary for Azerbaijan to create a detailed tourism strategy.  

In 2003, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funded a Definitional Mission to identify projects in the tourism sector.  The aim of this technical assistance project is to allow the Government of Azerbaijan to prioritize its tourism infrastructure development projects, study the market to match existing and prospective tourism destination products with existing and potential demand, analyze the economic impact of market targets, and determine if a plan for establishing a tourism development fund or other revenue base is necessary.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $308,050 grant to the Ministry from USTDA.  



 




A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or Azerbaijan.   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to the Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism of Azerbaijan c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. June 25, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Ministry reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Ministry also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Ministry is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Program Support Center on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Office of the Director, Consumer Affairs intends to award a simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition, 2904 Kirby  Lane, Austin, TX 78703.  The basis for this requirement is to provide support for an education campaign to alert the public to the danger of inhalants. To create a comprehensive and coordinated approach to effectively coalesce and focus a public-private effort to prevent and treat inhalant abuse, is intended to create a national model to deal with this significant health issue.  The problem of inhalant abuse is pervasive throughout the country.  Abuse affects all classes and cultures in our society.  Experimenters include our youngest children.  Consequences of use can be fatal, even at first use.  There is only a couple of treatment facilities equipped to deal with chronic abusers.  To effectively respond to inhalant abuse a thoughtful and coordinated approach must be developed and implemented.  The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC) is the only organization of its type with the requirement, know-how and dedication to combating inhalant abuse necessary to bring this project to fruition.  NIPC is an inhalant and information clearinghouse concerning inhalant related issues.  The Coalition generates media coverage, develops education and information materials, produces a quarterly newsletter, and provides training and technical assistance.  NIPC works with Federal, state and local government agencies, schools, businesses, trade associations, media, civic organizations, law enforcement, poison control centers, the medical community and interfaith groups throughout the country to develop awareness and prevention campaigns designed to educate youth and adults about the dangers of inhalants.  NIPC also provides in-service training for educators and maintains a web site on inhalants.  The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition created and continues National Inhalants & Poisons Awareness Week. The partnership with NIPC is a direct link to various SAMHSA/CSAT projects such as the Recovery Communities Support Program, the National Treatment Plan, the annual National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month (September), and SAMHSA/CSAT youth initiative grants.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention & Control (NCIPS), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) seeks to utilize a vendor,  working in collaboration with CDC and ACE Center staff that will design, develop, review, edit, publish, and launch a written and web-based journal to highlight the work of youth and the ACE Centers.   Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the vendor shall provide all labor, materials, and supplies necessary, except those specified to be provided by the Government, in the review and preparation of this published journal and website.  
Youth violence is a public health issue affecting the physical and emotional health of young people. Homicide remains the second leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year olds. Within this age group, homicide is the leading cause of death for African Americans, the second leading cause of death for Hispanic Americans, and the third leading cause of death for Native Americans. In 1998, 5,431 youths ages 15-24 were murdered on an average of 15 every day. Young people represented approximately one-third of all homicide victims in that year. Given the role of violence and homicide as a public health issue for American youth, it is important that effective strategies be identified and implemented to reduce the number of young people losing their lives due to violence.  
Recent attention has been drawn to youth violence due to widely publicized incidents of school shootings. Although nonfatal acts of violence are relatively common on school property, most acts of serious and fatal violent crime occur outside of school. Despite the recent shootings on school campuses, less than 1 percent of all violent deaths among school-aged children occur in schools (CDC MMWR, 2001). These data highlight the need for comprehensive prevention programs - in schools, families, and communities - that address risk for violent behaviors both on and off school property.

The Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention (ACE) were funded to serve as national models for the prevention of youth violence. The Centers have six core objectives: 
1)  providing the infrastructure to conduct interdisciplinary research relevant to youth violence;   
2)  supporting the surveillance of youth violence in their specific communities;  
3)  conducting innovative and relevant etiological work on risk and protective factors in youth violence;   
4)  developing, testing, and more broadly implementing effective violence prevention strategies;   
5)  offering mentoring and training initiatives to prepare professionals from diverse backgrounds to address the issue of  youth violence; and   
6)  creating partnerships with communities to develop plans to address youth violence.  

The purpose of this project is to fund the production and promotion of both a print and web version of a special issue of CYD Journal: Community Youth Development . This edition will be dedicated to highlighting the work of the National Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention (ACE). The ACE Centers represent a newly-funded approach that links universities and communities, enabling them to translate and apply scientific knowledge on youth violence into community-based action. Using community empowerment as a vehicle to address youth violence is critical to the success of any youth violence prevention program. The CYD Journal and website will provide a mechanism for the ACE Centers to share critical information and lessons learned regarding their experiences working at multiple levels with governmental and educational organizations, local community organizations, and youth, to effectively address youth violence.  
This special issue of CYD (Community Youth Development)Journal (www.cydjournal.org) will describe the strategies and conceptual models employed by the ACE Centers and other youth violence prevention organizations for involving young people in community violence prevention research, evaluation, training, community mobilization, policy development and dissemination efforts.  Although youth are increasingly becoming involved with (and sometimes driving) efforts to reduce youth violence and to reduce the impact of violence on youth, the rationale for these activities and the techniques for successfully involving youth are known to too few organizations and agencies.  This issue will address this gap by reviewing recent efforts to involve youth in youth development programs, a need identified in the IOM report (Community Programs That Promote Youth Development).
TASKS TO BE PERFORMED
The vendor shall perform the following tasks in consultation with CDC and ACE staff:   1)  Meet with CDC staff to review, revise, and submit a proposed statement of work which will include a work plan and budget for the production, publication and launch of the proposed journal;   2)  In collaboration with CDC and ACE Center staff conceptualize and develop a plan for the journal;   4)    Development of editorial guidelines and a peer review process for submissions;   5)  Gather information and provide written feedback from peer-review process to authors of submissions;   6)  Edit and revise submissions as needed for publication.  This process shall include incorporation of comments from various CDC reviewers;   7)  Develop design and layout of journal.  This task shall include but not be limited to:  identification of graphics for journal including cover; and final quality control on content, grammar, punctuation, format and layout of journal;   8)  Production and publication of 5000 print copies of the journal;   9)  Development of a dissemination and launch plan to publicize the journal.  This task shall include but not be limited to the following:  distribution of journal to subscribers and key ACE stakeholders; press releases; and development of a launch activity (such as a symposium) to highlight the journal;   10)  Design and development of journal website.  This task will also include the development of a resource section with web-links to appropriate resources, the CDC website, and ACE Center websites;  and   11)   Participate in conference calls with CDC and ACE staff to monitor and facilitate the development of the journal.  The period of performance for this procurement shall be 1 year from the Notice of the Award.

<DESC>The Department of Housing and Urban Development intends to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract No.GNMA-99-PA-01 to provide necessary services associated with the Mortgage Backed Security Administration with Lockheed Martin Information Services Division.  The modification will include initial Business Process Improvement  (BPI) tasks, data collection, analysis and risk management, continuation of operations support, systems upgrades and enhancement and related services necessary to continue and improve the current Risk Analysis processes.  The modification will include a base period of one year, with two 6-month options.  A Request for Information (RFI) released in December 2003 requested feedback on the ability to competitively solicit offers for this work.  The results of the RFI indicated that the services are not adequately stable at this time to describe effectively or to immediately implement the results of the BPI.  At the conclusion of the modification, the work and associated processes will have a stable baseline that can be competed on a full and open competitive basis.  No other firm has the current knowledge, skills, information, facilities and data rights to provide the services to the Government without interruption while the BPI is initiated. This modification is necessary to ensure that the processes are not interrupted or negatively affected by the current changes ongoing due to the BPI.

<DESC>Negotiations are being conducted on a sole source basis with MedRespond for Interactive Health and Safety Information for Workers – Automated Internet Synthetic Interview for NIOSH approved Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) for protection against Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) agents.

SCOPE OF WORK

	The contractor will develop and produce a web based process to automate the current information delivery and response procedures for queries related to required self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) equipment and components for protection against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents that are regularly received by NIOSH staff.  The system will provide a powerful tool that delivers an immediate video response to a text query to enhance worker understanding of SCBA equipment and components and further safeguard personal safety.  The system will be capable of selecting various SCBA components and identifying NIOSH approved configurations and informing the inquirer of the validity of a request.  In addition, the system will provide NIOSH with a sophisticated tracking / monitoring measure of which questions are asked and at what frequency, revealing user concerns, possible misunderstandings, and potential misuse of equipment.  Moreover, as the system is on the Internet, it will be available 24/7 supporting workers and first responders at all times.

	The technology should provide a tool to provide an immediate response to a text query as well as a data capture feature that would track all questions asked on the site.  This powerful technology would enhance worker understanding of certified self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and personal safety and would further provide the CDC/NIOSH with a precise measure of which questions are asked and at what frequency.   The process should be capable of operating in any spoken language, making the content universally available.


CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENTS

	The contractor shall be capable of developing a user friendly web based application equivalent to the patented technology from Carnegie Mellon University, known as a Synthetic Interview.  The technology provides a fully interactive experience, allowing an internet site visitor to enter a text query and receive a pre-recorded video response that is the answer to the specific question.  The technology is powered by an 'intelligent switch' that recognizes language and accommodates mistakes in spelling and grammar.  The Synthetic Interview technology should provide the site visitor the impression of an actual conversation with the video personality.  The technology should be available whenever and wherever there is an internet connection any time of the day or night.  The technology should be extremely robust allowing users with even the slowest internet connections to access the Interviews.   


SUBMIT RFQ TO:

Qualified organizations may submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit written information to:  Viola Barbour, CDC/PGO/AAFB, Building 140, P.O. Box 18070, Pittsburgh, PA  15236.    Reference:  VAB-HCCC-2004-09816

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California intends to extend the Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC) #F04684-98-C-0014 with MCA Engineers Inc, for a period of two months, commencing 1 Apr 04.  The actual length of extension will be determined by the projected award date of follow-on Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) solicitation #F04684-02-R-0024.  By extending the LO&SC, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new 6 year LOSC is being competed.  The current LO&SC provides management, maintenance, repair, upgrade, demolition, engineering and on-site support for the Western Range launch, operation, and test facilities, infrastructure and equipment.  Interested firms must have the ability to provide required expertise for launch critical services and the workforce to provide required services and on-site support upon award.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of the Western Range and launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of cost. Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Vincent W. Sanford within 5 days of this publication.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support and operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (ii) commercial practices.  Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

-8 Sep 03 DRAFT EAS Performance Base PWS 01
-DRAFTs of  PWS 01 through 06

Base Operations and Maintenance for EAS, ALASKA under the cognizance of Elmendorf AFB AK and AFPEO. 1.1 "3CONS" is issuing this request for information announcement F65501-03-R-0002 for Industry Comments.  The Air Force strategy for O&M of EAS is to issue the RFP as a Competitive 8(a) Set-aside.  The strategy is for Cost Plus Award Term/Award Fee contract type.   The award term would result in a contract with a performance period of Basic year, plus 4 one-year options and 3 one-year award terms.   1.2   THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This acquisition strategy may change prior to final RFP release.  This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals or cost and pricing data. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party’s expense.  If a solicitation is released, it will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  2.1 Background: "3CONS" is seeking Industry comments on the proposed type contract and incentives, as indicated in above verses; present is Firm Fixed Price/Award Fee type of contract for base year and four one year options.  The proposed strategy is a substantial change to the current contract.  The objective is to establish an incentive for outstanding performance and mutually benefit the Air Force and the contracting partner.  The current EAS Performance Work Statement (PWS) is posted so you can get an idea of the requirement.  Industry is invited to propose other incentive strategies for government‘s consideration.  Request comments be submitted no later than 2 weeks from date of posting.  POC is Charlotte Halstead/907-552-5699 or Mary Howell/907-552-5153.  Requested Information: 3.1 White paper 3.1.1. The white paper is limited to a maximum of 10 pages in length. White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2000 compatible format are requested via e-mail no later than 14 calendar days after the date of this announcement to Charlotte Halstead/3CONS/LGCZ at charlotte.halstead@elmendorf.af.mil.  North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code 561210, Facilities Support Services. The corresponding size standard is $30M. ?Small business concern? means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $30 million dollars in annual receipts. Annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern takes for the last 3 fiscal years. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52. Responders are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(C) (1), Justification:  Supplies (or Services) are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification.

The Government  team will then notify each interested party with further instructions including  website and login instructions.  During Industry Day each participant will  login during their alloted 30 minute segment of time to ask questions or  provide comments.   PRE-SOLICITATION  NOTICE 1.  The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date. Contact Information:  Ms. Nancy Williamson, Contracting Officer, ASC/RAKPM,  321.757.1795,  e-mail: nancy.williamson@ patrick.af.mil.

WIRING OF 10Mbp INTERNET CONNECTION AND SERVICES


Statement of Work

Phase I

The contractor shall provide and install 2 pair of single mode fiber (“the spare dark fiber”) from the telecommunications room, 3rd floor, South Building, 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, to the computer room in the East Building Basement, 4th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.   

The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary Right-of-Ways and for the success of the overall installation of the spare dark fiber.  

NOTE TO OFFERORS:
Currently, all existing communications facilities use Verizon conduit through manhole number 3374.  The National Gallery of Art (NGA) desires to establish a diverse, redundant network path between the South Building at 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW and the East and West NGA Buildings.  However, the NGA will consider proposals using the Verizon manhole system.  The PEPCO manhole system and the Verizon manhole system are the entry points for communications services of which the Gallery is aware.  Other options may be proposed if they are available.

The following applies for vendors entering the Gallery using the Pepco manhole system.  Vendors choosing to propose an alternate path must submit a schematic detailing the path through the gallery as well as a written narrative describing the proposed installation.  Gallery staff will be available for a walk-though at 10:30 am on May 26th and May 27th.  

The contractor shall furnish and install all fiber in 3” EMT conduit with two inner ducts from the East Building entrance to the Telecommunications pull box 1 as shown on the two-sheet illustration provided upon request to b-manley@nga.gov.  The Contractor must use steel compression coupling.  The contractor shall support all conduits in accordance with BICSI installation standards. 
 
The Contractor shall enter the side of the pull box 1 and continue to pull fiber through entire conduit to room SC-8.  The Contractor shall install the fiber optic cable from pull box 1 to SC8.   The contractor will remove an abandoned cable from the 4” conduit between pull box 1 and SC-8 and install (2) two new inner ducts in its place.  The Contractor shall then cut the removed cables to the extent necessary to dispose of them in a Gallery-furnished dumpster outside the East Building.

The Contractor shall terminate all fiber in an LIU provided by the contractor on the back board in room SC-11.  Fiber shall be patched through to existing single mode fiber.  Contractor shall label, tag, and install fiber in a professional manner as per BICSI cabling installation standards for fiber.  


The Contractor’s completed installation must be approved by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), Katherine Green.

Phase II

The Contractor shall provide monthly 10Mbps connection internet access services in room CLA 6A in the connecting link between the NGA East and West Buildings with the use of installed fiber optics only.  No substitution is allowed.  The contractor shall provide primary DNS services for the NGA.  NOTE:  The offeror must specify the 10Mbps transmission protocol (i.e. Ethernet, ATM, or other) in their response to this solicitation. The implementation of these services must be approved by the COTR, Katherine Green.

The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary Right-of-Ways and for the success of the overall installation and the 10Mbp INTERNET CONNECTION.


WORK HOURS AND PARKING

The Contractor shall perform all Phase I work on-site at the National Gallery of Art on Monday through Friday, excluding Holidays, from 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM, unless otherwise agreed to with the Contracting Officer. The National Gallery of Art  does not provide parking for contractor vehicles.  If the Contractor requires short-term parking for delivery of materials, the Contractor must request approval at least two work days in advance of the date(s) that parking is needed.  Approval is not guaranteed. 


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The Contractor shall complete all work described above for Phase I within eight (10) weeks following contract award.  The National Gallery of Art will order monthly 10Mbp connection internet access service from the date beginning with completion of Phase I and ending on September 30, 2004.

CONTRACT AWARD

The National Galley of Art will make a contractor selection based on the response(s) to this solicitation determined to be the most advantageous in terms of the three evaluation criteria stated above.	The NGA may select one contractor for Phase I , a separate contractor for Phase II, or one contractor for Phases I and II,  subject to offers received and determination of those that are most advantageous.  The NGA may decide to award a contract for Phase II only.

SECURITY

1.  Security Clearances

Security clearances are required for all contractor personnel working in the Gallery.   Immediately upon contract award, the contractor is to submit to the COTR the documentation for requests for security clearances for contractor personnel proposed to work on the contract.  The Gallery’s security office will perform a background security check on each proposed worker.  Because of the mission of the Gallery, and the potential for risk in permitting access to secured areas, there is no guarantee that a security clearance will be issued to any proposed employee.  The Gallery reserves the right to deny access to the Gallery areas during times when the Gallery is closed, and to deny access to non-public areas.   

1.1.  Documentation for Requests for Security Clearances

1.1.1  The request package must include the following completed documents, for each proposed employee.

The National Gallery of Art Authorization for Release of Information

The National Gallery of Art Contractor ID Request Form

(Copies of the blank documents follow this section.)

A clear photocopy of proposed employee’s driver’s license must be included in the package.  

1.1.2  The request package for permanent badges must include the following.

Optional Form 306-0182 Declaration for Federal Employment

The contractor shall submit request packages for all employees expected to work on site at the Gallery.  Obtaining security clearances is costly.  Therefore, the Gallery will not accept packages of requests that appear to be the contractor’s company roster.  Every effort will be made to complete security clearance checks quickly, however, the contractor shall plan for a seven work day processing period, for both initial requests and subsequent requests.  

The security staff will notify the COTR of the results of the security clearance check.  The COTR will immediately notify the contractor of the results.   In the event a proposed employee in not cleared for work at the Gallery, the contractor shall immediately – and within three work days, submit a request package for a substitute employee.  



1.2.  Badges

The Gallery issues two types of badges to contractor employees:  Permanent (“hard”) badges and temporary (paper) badges.  Each type has certain responsibilities and privileges.  It is completely at the Gallery’s discretion as to which type of badge is issued to contractors’ employees.   Each employee must wear the badge is a visible manner at all times when on Gallery property.  

Security Clauses (Continued)

All contractor employees who are issued temporary must sign-in and sign-out with the Gallery’s security staff, each time they enter/exit the Gallery.   Employees who have been issued permanent badges must scan the badge at each entry and exit.  
 
The permanent badge permits unaccompanied access to most Gallery areas.   The permanent badge is issued for a stated period of time, and is held by the employee until the expiration date or the time when the Gallery requests return.   

The temporary badge is issued on a daily basis and must be returned the security staff when exiting the Gallery.  Employees with temporary badges must be escorted when in the Gallery while the Gallery is closed to the public and when in non-public areas.  

The COTR will provide precise direction about Gallery access, at time of contract award. 

The contractor is responsible for immediately report any lost or misplaced badges to the COTR and the security staff.   The contractor is responsible for immediately returning any badges that where issued to employees who are no longer working on the contract.    

1.3  Access Hours

Generally, contractors will be permitted entry to the Gallery during the hours of 6:00AM and 6:00PM, Monday through Friday.  However, if a contract or task order requires different hours, those hours will be stated in the contract or task order.  

Work outside the normal contractor work hours or the hours required in a particular contract require prior COTR approval.  The contractor shall submit requests for different work hours to the COTR at least three business days before proposed change.  

Providing escorts for contractor employees is costly.  In order to contain costs, the contractor is responsible to notify the COTR if any employees will be arriving later than scheduled.  If the COTR is not available at the time of notification, the contractor shall notify the security staff of the proposed late arrival.  
   
1.4.   The designated point of entry to, and exit from, the Gallery, for contractor staff, is the West Building Service Entrance.   The Service Entrance is on Constitution Avenue, south of the Mellon Fountain and east of the Gallery’s 6th Street entrance.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM HEALTH ACTUARIAL FIRMS

The Defense Human Resource Activity, Office of the Actuary, Arlington, VA is considering commissioning a study by a health actuarial firm to analyze and provide cost projections related to TRICARE, the Department of Defense health program for military beneficiaries.  We are seeking information regarding the type of analysis and approach health actuarial firms could provide, and the feasibility of being able to deliver results within a 2-3 month timeframe.  If it is infeasible to complete a comprehensive study and provide a final report within a 2-3 month timeframe, we would like to know what type of interim or draft results could be provided.  We would also like to know the requirements in terms of the type of Military Health System (MHS) data that would need to be provided to the firm.

TRICARE benefits are provided at military hospitals, clinics and pharmacies (the direct-care system), and purchased from the private-sector care through the Department’s insurance component (purchased care).  The ultimate desired output is a 5 to 10 year projection of Defense Health Program (DHP) costs to care for over 8 million eligible DoD beneficiaries to reflect the firm’s best projection of expected utilization and cost increases for current users of the system, utilization and cost increases related to the increase in the number of users, advances in medical practice and medical inflation.  

Of particular interest is the recent phenomenon referred to as the “return of previously non-reliant” (or “ghost”) beneficiaries to the DoD Military Health-Care System.   The growth in ghost beneficiaries are expected to lead to significant cost increases.  The ghost effect largely relates to the growing relative attractiveness of the TRICARE benefit compared to alternative plans.

The types of useful analysis and results that are desired include: 

Analysis of the TRICARE benefit as compared to private sector plans.  This could be done both qualitatively and quantitatively, e.g., assigning a relative value measure to the TRICARE benefit compared to a typical private sector plan.  Assess the actuarial value of the TRICARE benefit compared to civilian plans.

Analysis of historical cost trends, reasons for the cost increase, and projected cost of the DHP due to the value of the TRICARE benefit analysis from above.  For example, TRICARE offers a comprehensive benefit with low beneficiary cost-sharing amounts that have not been indexed over time.  Analysis potentially would include assessing all MHS beneficiaries’ propensity and need for enrollment in and use of other (non-DoD) private insurance and expected ultimate percentage of eligible beneficiaries who would use TRICARE and to what extent.

Analysis of the effect of the recently-enacted TRICARE for Life (TFL) benefit for Medicare-eligible DoD beneficiaries on costs for non-Medicare-eligible beneficiaries.  For example, the existence of the TFL benefit eliminates the requirement certain under-65 retirees may previously have had to maintain other coverage in order to have continuing insurance coverage upon attaining Medicare eligibility.  The potential effect is to increase TRICARE costs for the non-Medicare-eligible population.

Analysis of the worst-case scenario, i.e., costs if all eligible MHS beneficiaries dropped all other coverages and relied exclusively on TRICARE.

Analysis of other factors leading to cost increases, such as would be seen in other market plans.

We are not committing to conducting this study; we are only seeking information and interest at this time.  For further information please contact Mr. Joel Sitrin, Joel Sitrin, Chief Actuary, DoD Office of the Actuary, 4040 N. Fairfax Dr. Suite 308

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support and operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (ii) commercial practices.  Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications 8(a) and HUBZONE relative to this 541720 - Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities, North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS).  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The period of performance for the intended contract shall be eighteen months.  Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code and must respond to the following questions: 1) Are you considered to be a certified HUBZone firm? 2) Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? 3) If disadvantaged, specify is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 4) Are you considered to be woman-owned or operated business? (5) Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned?  In addition, please provide a capability statement addressing your organization’s ability to perform as a prime contractor for the following:

Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Officers have been providing health care services for the American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) since the early 1900's. Until 1955 this was accomplished by assignment of officers to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1955, the Federal responsibility for providing healthcare services to AI/AN was transferred to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now known as the Department of Health and Human Services.  

The accomplishments of the PHS Commissioned Corps Officers have been unprecedented in the history of service for indigenous peoples. While this accomplishment may be well recorded in general terms, the role of the PHS Commissioned Corps Officers has not been compiled or documented into a single document. Because of this lack of documentation, there is often a lack of knowledge and awareness, on the part of the general public and American Indian and Alaska Native communities, of the role the Corps has played in AI/AN healthcare in the past and, thus, the future positive potential for the service of these officers who clearly serve with distinction.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) is seeking a fuller documentation of the activities and accomplishments of the PHS Commissioned Corps relative to improving the health of AI/AN.  This documentation would include a pamphlet for public consumption and a full report of Commissioned Corps activities within AI/AN communities.

A significant portion of the personnel working on this project should have had experience as Commissioned Corps Officers in the IHS; however, the Contractor may hire graduate students in public health as associate researchers.  Face to face interviews are required so there will some travel involved.

It is expected that research and preparation of the report will take approximately 18 months. 

This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Responses to this notice shall sent to Michele Namoski, Contracting Officer,  Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisitions Service, Division of Acquisition Management, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 5-101, Rockville, MD 20857.  Responses must be received in writing no later than 4:00pm, local prevailing time, June 8, 2004.  Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.  No solicitation is currently available.

Description:

The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving market information supporting the design and production of a Lighter than Air stratospheric vehicle.  The objective of this vehicle will be to demonstrate the engineering feasibility and potential military utility of an unmanned, un-tethered, gas filled, solar powered airship that can fly at 63,000 ft in the summer of 2006.  The prototype airship developed under this effort will be capable of continuous and controlled flight for a minimum of seven days on station while carrying 500 pounds of payloads with 3kW of power to the payload.  This vehicle is intended as a developmental step toward an objective vehicle that can self deploy from the continental United States to worldwide locations.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain industry concepts and market information for the aforementioned vehicle.  This RFI is not a commitment by the Government or a solicitation (Request for Proposal).  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this RFI.  A follow-on RFP/solicitation does not exist at this time.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
ON SCREENING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.


Pursuant to Section 44920 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), Public Law 107-71 (November 19, 2001), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will establish a Screening Partnership Program in which an airport may apply to have the screening of passengers and baggage at the airport carried out by screening personnel of a qualified private company (also referred to as the Opt-Out program) under a contract entered into with TSA.  

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking industry participation in the development of the acquisition strategy for the procurement of these services inclusive of the application process.  This requirement may also include Human Resources functions, such as the recruitment, assessment, and the training of screeners.  TSA seeks to implement a procurement process that (a) follows ATSA; (b) encourages innovation and cost savings while ensuring security; (c) provides flexibility to meet changing security needs; (d) streamlines the issuance of contracts; and (e) encourages competition.  The estimated period of performance will be a one-year base plus four one-year options.  This RFI serves as a means of gaining ideas relevant to the following: (1) Acquisition Strategy, Contract Structure, Contract Type, and Performance Standards/Metrics (to be used as cost and performance incentives); (2) Proposal Evaluation Criteria to include the establishment of a Qualified Vendors List (QVL); (3) Information contractors feel they would need in the Request for Proposal (RFP) to make an informed proposal; (4) Ideas on how to best achieve the objectives listed above; (5) The Airport Application Process; and (6) Identification of possible opportunities for small business participation.

Industry input shall not include proprietary information, nor shall the comments deviate from any of the requirements for the program, Section 44920 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) (P.L. 107-71).

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to conduct a demonstration of innovative commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) energy storage devices and AC/DC converters that are capable of working with commercially available sources/devices of/for solar power generation.  The energy storage devices must be capable of connecting with flexible solar panels such as those embedded in tent fabrics as well as other solar gain devices and must be capable of at least 100 kW of energy storage.  The required stored-energy power output is 120/208 VAC.  The stored energy devices should also be lightweight and any “system” should also be lightweight (less than 4,740Lb shipping weight), no larger than 87"L X 36"W X 59"H and shall not present any environmental issues.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 18 June 2004.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Robert Gates of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at gatesr@ctcnsc.org or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.

<DESC>The US Air Force (USAF) is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to using a tactical remote controlled air vehicle to assist in security and counterterrorism/antiterrorism responsibilities.  The technology must be electro-optical/ infrared-optical (EO/ IR) capable with the ability to change back and forth between the two if necessary.  The technology should be transportable by one person with a weight of no more than 40 lbs.  The tactical remote controlled vehicle should have a loiter speed in excess of 40 knots and a sprint speed in excess of 80 knots, with a loiter time of 8 hours  The vehicle should have the ability to port multiple sensors in a single gimballed payload, as well as the ability to add a transponder.  The technology should have an endurance of at least 3 hours and a range at a tactically significant distance.  The goal of the technology is to have a vehicle that is transportable and operable by a two person team.  Training for the technology should take no longer than 8 hours.

<RESPDATE>062104
<ARCHDATE>08202004
<CONTACT>Kathy Wallace, 256-895-1145
<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, is seeking a commercial solution to meet our customerÃ¢Â€Â™s needs for Debris Processing Services at various Army Installations. The ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Installation Management Agency (IMA) is respons ible for providing equitable, effective and efficient management of Army installations worldwide.  IMA is divided into seven geographic regions encompassing the continental United States as well as the Pacific, Europe and Korea. Among the many Army-wide pr ograms assigned to IMA, the Facility Reduction Program (FRP) eliminates excess facilities and infrastructure which reduces fixed installation costs.  The disposal of construction and demolition debris imposes a disproportionate burden on the landfills of m any Army installations. This burden could be lessened if the debris were to be processed through a grinder to reduce volume and to render certain debris reusable. The primary material to be processed is concrete, followed by bituminous material, and masonr y. Depending on the quality of the material and mixture of debris, all of these materials can be immediately re-used or stored on-site for later use as aggregate, paving base, shoulder spoil, or fill. In some situations wood debris can be processed for use  as mulch or ground cover. A certain minimum quantity of debris with reuse potential must exist before it is economical to use the expensive grinding equipment.  Absent the grinding process, which permits either reuse of the material or reduction in its vo lume, debris must be taken directly to the landfill.  However, with the knowledge that the debris will be processed in the near future, the Base Commander can order the debris to be stockpiled until a large enough quantity has been accumulated to make the grinding process economically viable. To insure that this acquisition takes maximum advantage of economies of scale the DPS will operate on each base or location for a period of not less than one day.  Average time at a site is expected to be no more than five days. If a base or location needs less than one dayÃ¢Â€Â™s worth of service it is deemed impracticable for the DPS. The DPS will schedule operations that will make best use of the climate and weather of the IMA regions.  Demolition of buildings and st ructures inherently effects the local environment. Local regulations will be identified. The Government shall provide information that relates to hazardous material and environmental protection regulations at each base.    Businesses that have the ability to meet this specific requirement are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to include the following information:  detailed information on how the work will be accomplished; equipment availability, equipment description and rough order of ma gnitude.  Responses or questions are to be sent by email to kathy.r.wallace@hnd01.usace.army.mil.  Written responses are due by 21 Jun 2004.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intention to Award Sole Source Contract for Collection of HEDIS Data
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to award a service contract for the collection of Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) data and for providing Federal Employees and retirees' access to accreditation information.
 
HEDIS is a tool used to measure and assess health plans' performances by looking at their structures and processes.  HEDIS is also part of an integrated system to establish accountability in managed care.
 
OPM intends to award a service contract to the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) 2000 L Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036, for the collection of HEDIS data.  HEDIS was developed and maintained by NCQA, an organization committed to assessing, reporting on and improving the quality of care provided by organized delivery systems.  NCQA has developed the measures OPM wished to collect and is already receiving the data in an established database from many of the health plans OPM wants to participate.  OPM wants this project to be integrative, as much as possible, with NCQA's current data collection activities and information products.  This approach would take maximum advantage of NCQA's existing systems and processes, resulting in substantial savings to the Government, since NCQA will not charge the Government for work they are already performing.  Any other contractor would have to duplicate the effort and charge accordingly.
 
Any company which believes they can provide an equivalent service should provide complete information regarding their service and representative pricing to OPM within 15 days of the publication of this notice.  This is not a solicitation for offers but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate a sole source award to NCQA.  If OPM determines that competition is possible, a pre-solicitation notice will be issued.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Synopsis for Fiscal Year 2005 Per Diem Lodging Review
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP), Office of Transportation and Personal Property (OTPP) is required by law to establish maximum per diem allowances up to which federal travelers are reimbursed for travel expenses incurred while on official business travel within the Continental United States (CONUS).  With respect to lodging, the standard CONUS lodging per diem rate, which is reviewed every three years, covers most of the country.  In addition, OTPP annually reviews and establishes the lodging per diem rates for approximately 450 highly travelled, “designated” destinations within the CONUS.  We conduct this annual review of “designated” lodging rates to ensure that federal travelers receive fair and equitable reimbursement for their travel expenses while performing official travel to these locations where local market conditions create the need for rates higher than the standard CONUS per diem rate.

To accomplish the review of the standard CONUS and designated-location per diem rates, OTPP contracts with a travel industry data research firm to collect and provide an average daily lodging rate based on a set period of time.  OTPP then sets the appropriate per diem for each location after an extensive analysis and review of this contractor-provided data.   

OTPP seeks to contract with a travel industry data research firm with extensive experience within the lodging industry to provide (a) expert consultation and (b) historical and current lodging industry supply, demand, and revenue data for lodging properties within CONUS.  Under this contract, OTPP will acquire lodging industry average daily rate data and expert assistance needed in the review and establishment of the Federal Government’s standard CONUS and additional “designated” lodging per diem rates for Fiscal Year (FY) 2005.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to award a sole source contract to Smith Travel Research (STR).  Through its experience and market research, GSA believes that only STR possesses the required capability and technical expertise to perform this requirement.  Any other firm desiring consideration must fully identify its capability to perform this requirement within the required timeframe and allotted budget.  GSA plans to make a sole source award to STR after fifteen (15) days of the publication of this notice.  Please note that this announcement is not a Request for Proposal and no solicitation will be issued as a result of this notice.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Mr. Erik Gorman to perform glass and biochemical work.  Work requires skills normally possessed by a glass worker, but these skills must be applied to the fabrication of micron and nanometer size glass fibers that normally carry visible and infrared (into the mid infrared and terahertz wavelength) optical signals.  Fabrication of nanobioprobes is required as well as production of new photonic crystal fibers and three-dimensional photonic crystal devices.  Skills equivalent to a college degree in biochemistry are needed in order to participate in experiments involving cell cultures and cell counting.  An award will be made ten (10) days from the date of this notice. Sources which believe thay have the capability to perform these services must submit a capability statement and a proposed hourly rate that will be charged.  The FDA will review and consider these submissions in making its award decision.  The award will be made as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR 13.5.

The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights.  Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 entitled, “Evaluation - Commercial Items.”  A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number for the announcement is NICHD 2004-06 and this announcement is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This announcement and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23.
 
This requirement is a total small business set-aside and the associated NAICS code is 541690 and small business size standard is $6.0 million. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for Systematic Literature Summaries, Assessments, Syntheses and Meta-Analyses. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of drugs for which pediatric clinical studies are needed.  

The BPCA requires the NIH to develop, prioritize and publish in the Federal Register an annual list of approved drugs for which:

1.	There is an approved Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). 
2.	There is a submitted ANDA that could receive FDA approval. 
3.	There is no patent protection or market exclusivity for an existing New Drug Application (NDA.) 
4.	There is referral for inclusion on the list regardless of market protection.

The BPCA legislation states:

CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION- In developing and prioritizing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider, for each drug on the list--
(A) 	the availability of information concerning the safe and effective use of the drug in the pediatric population;
(B) 	whether additional information is needed;
(C) 	whether new pediatric studies concerning the drug may produce health benefits in the pediatric population; and
(D) 	whether reformulation of the drug is necessary.

 In addition, the BPCA legislative language identifies the group of drugs eligible for consideration, essentially off-patent medications, for which “additional studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the use of the drug in the pediatric population”.  

Annual lists were published in the Federal Register in January 2003 and February 2004, with a mid-cycle list published in August 2003.

The Government has a requirement for the expertise and resources necessary to conduct assessments of the available literature, and systematic reviews of the literature on scientific questions related to implementation of BPCA.  The reviews shall center primarily on prescription medications used by the pediatric populations, but may also include topics related to the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric populations, (e.g., a systematic review of the literature regarding consent processes in pediatric clinical trials.)  

The ontractor shall be required to analyze questions, as specified by the Government, which can be addressed by meta-analysis, and address areas where meta-analysis can be used to inform the labeling process.  This task shall be followed by further meta-analyses conducted to answer specific questions regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), efficacy and safety of prescription drugs in pediatric populations.  

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable database, updated on an annual basis, comprising the literature of case reports, case series, observational studies and clinical trials for off-patent drugs used by the pediatric population. 

BPCA requires NICHD to participate in FDA’s preparation of Written Requests by providing scientific input.  These Written Requests may potentially become future requirements for pediatric clinical studies.  An end result of this process may be to prepare INDs (FDA regulatory documents) leading to drug labeling changes.  

Each of these activities requires literature synthesis, and many shall require meta-analyses.  In infrequent situations, where outside experts state that sufficient data are available to lead directly to comments on labeling changes (without further study), NICHD shall require a complete meta-analysis of efficacy and/or safety data to produce quantitative estimates of efficacy and/or safety.  The Contractor shall maintain a central data base of documents pertaining to the literature, and simultaneously adapt the literature syntheses to the needs at each step of the BPCA process.  This shall require a high level scientific input in design, conduct, and interpretation of each literature search and its products: systematic literature reviews and/or meta-analyses.

There may be instances when systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses are needed to address methodological questions regarding the conduct of pediatric clinical trials, for instance, to summarize approaches to randomization, the consent process, or other questions of study design.

In order to assess the availability of information about individual off-patent drugs, the Government has a requirement for state-of-the art systematic reviews of the literature.  In order to develop and prioritize the annual list, the Government will specify to the Contractor the drugs under consideration. The reviews shall be systematic, follow a validated methodology for search and synthesis, provide documentation, and produce literature syntheses that address the needs for further study.  
From an annual list of approximately 200 off-patent drugs as published in the Federal Register, the Government will identify a group (estimated not-to exceed 35) of drugs requiring initial assessments of the literature. The Government anticipates selecting 12 each year as prioritized for further study.  .  

The Government requires continual expansion and updating of literature reviews throughout the process of developing Written Requests, preparing solicitations, developing clinical trials and submitting data for regulatory labeling.  Smaller groups of drugs will require more extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses, as described below.  

The Contractor shall perform the following services from the annual list: 

1)	Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year. 
The Contractor shall perform a comprehensive assessment of the literature using a standardized search methodology, and documenting the search methodology.  The work shall include all information about the drug in neonates and children under the age of 18.  The assessment of the literature shall include a quantitative enumeration of the total number of references regarding the drug, as well as sub-totals for the following categories:  case-reports and case series, observational studies, and clinical trials.  A separate enumeration will be made by content of the references for the following sub-categories:  PK/PD data, pharmacoepidemiology (patterns of use), efficacy, and safety.  Pharmacoepidemiology shall include:  indications for using the drug in pediatric populations, inpatient and outpatient frequency of use, age, sex and race/ethnicity patterns of use.  The contractor shall develop a summary format to assess the quality and availability of data regarding PK/PD, efficacy and safety for each drug, and to identify research questions requiring further study for scientific of regulatory (labeling) purposes.
2)	Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall conduct a systematic review of the literature, involving abstraction/extraction of data in the articles identified in item 1, and summarizing findings in tables and text.  These syntheses shall be used to inform detailed discussion of drugs under consideration to be included in the priority list published each January.  The syntheses shall be circulated to expert consultants (Government and non-Government) to assist them in formulating recommendations for prioritization.
3)	Expanded literature review as background for Written Request process - 12 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall expand the systematic reviews prepared under item 2 and provide a literature synthesis to be used as background for NICHD scientists working with FDA to prepare the Written Request for a specified drug.   The emphasis of the literature synthesis shall be to provide information regarding research needs, and information needed in designing a study such as estimates of effect, estimates of adverse events, and measurement of outcomes.
4)	Expanded literature review as background for Project Officer - 12 drugs as specified by the Government
The Contractor shall expand on the systematic reviews prepared under item 3 and prepare a literature synthesis to be used as background for NICHD Project Officers preparing future requirements which may become pediatric clinical studies.
5)	Literature synthesis for regulatory requirements (IND process) - 6 drugs/indication combinations as specified by the Government 
The Contractor  shall expand on the systematic reviews prepared under item 4 to provide a finished document that may be submitted by NICHD to FDA as part of the IND process.
6)	Meta-analyses - 3 drug/indication combinations as specified by the Government 
The Contractor shall conduct meta-analyses of specific questions regarding PK/PD, efficacy and/or safety.  These meta-analyses shall be provided to scientific experts to determine the feasibility and best course of action for initiating a label change based on the published data and the meta-analysis.  The meta-analyses need to be comparable in quality to those published in the best peer reviewed journals. The Government anticipates the publication of the meta-analysis in peer-reviewed journals.
7)	Meta-analysis – 1 methodologic issue in pediatric clinical trials as specified by the Government.
The Contractor shall conduct a meta-analysis of methodologic issues in pediatric clinical trials.
8)	The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable data base that accumulates information abstracted/extracted during the period of performance of the contract, 
9)	The Contractor  shall document all methodologies and provide documentation to NICHD in electronic form. 

It is anticipated that this requirement shall be for a base year and up to an additional four one-year option period(s.)  Offerors are instructed to include in their proposal, their prices for the base year and up to an additional four one-year option period(s.) 

The NICHD has an annual requirement for: Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year; Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government; Expanded literature review as background for Written Request process - 12 drugs as specified by the Government; Expanded literature review as background for Project Officer - 12 drugs as specified by the Government; Literature synthesis for regulatory requirements (IND process) - 6 drugs/indication combinations as specified by the Government; and Meta-analysis – 1 methodologic issue in pediatric clinical trials as specified by the Government.

TELEPHONE QUESTION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Evaluation-Commercial Items (FAR 52.212-2)(Jan 1999). (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (See FAR 2.101, Best Value). The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, with consideration given to the factors of past performance, proposed technical merit, and price. This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the government. BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of simplified acquisition procurements and predefines the value characteristics, which will serve as the discriminators among offers. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose proposal has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other proposals warrant doing so. The performance specification included serves as the Government's baseline requirements. Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements, will be judged against these value characteristics listed below which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer beyond the baseline requirements.  The following characteristics that are applicable to this procurement: 1. The vendors' ability to exceed the technical criteria established for the hardware and software in the performance specification. 2. The abtributes of the warranty associated with the automated battery test stand. 3. The vendors' past performance in the field of producing battery test equipment and producing satisfied customers. The attached Statement of Work (SOW) and Specification is applicable to this procurement. Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with consideration given to the factors of proposed technical merit, price, and past performance. It is critical that offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer. (SEE FAR 52.212-1 (b)). Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with their offer. These may be obtained via the Internet at URL:		 http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/eps/templates/Commercial_Greather_Than_25K.doc      . These representations and certifications will be incorporated by reference in any resultant contract. An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B". Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the following Internet site for the release of solicitation amendments (if any):    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	 . Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this combination synopsis/solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemental and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be used.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation number is RFQ-R8-04-13.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  The applicable Standard Industrial Classification 2879 and size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Forest Services is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item no. (1a) – Glyphosate 4#/gallon (no surfactant) 1125 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box) OR Item no. (1b) Glyphosate 5.4#/gallon (no surfactant) 840 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box) OR Item no. (1c) a mix of the 2 formulations yielding the equivalent poundage of a.e. (4500 lbs).  Item no. (2) – Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 750 gallons (2.5 gallon container, 2 per per box).  Item no. (3) – Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (4 lb a.e./gal; product specific; no substitutions) 275 gallons (1 quart container, 4 per box).  Item no. (4) – Arsenal (2 lb a.e./gal; product specific; no substitutions) 550 gallons (1 quart container, 4 per box).  Item no. (5) Triclopyr amine (3# a.e./gal in water solution) 1650 gallons or equivalent amount of a.e. (4900 lbs ai) in alternative formulations (2.5 gal containers - 2 per box).  Item no. (6) Triclopyr ester (4# a.e./gal) 1775 gallons or equivalent amount of a.e. (7100# a.e.) in alternative formulation (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box).   Products 2-4 are product specific (to meet Environment Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements), and package sizes are specific to meet desired storage and safety standards during use. While other products or packaging is available they are unacceptable due to either to regulatory or safety constraints.  
Products 1a and lb are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Proposed working for the quote would be "Glyphosate as a solution in water without surfactant – 4500 lbs a.i. as either 1125 gallons of a 4# a.i./gal formulation, 840 gallons of a 5.4 lb a.i./gal formulation, or a combination of the two formulation weights resulting in a total weight of a.i. of 4500 lbs (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box). Must be labeled for forestry use."  Quoters may submit a quote on Items 1a, lb or lc.   (Separate listings are given to allow purchase of existing 4#a.i../gal stock or to procure appropriate 5.4# a.i./gal products).  
Product 5 is triclopyr amine formulated in water solution.  A total of 1650 galls of the 3# a.e./gallon formulations (traditional formulation = 4900 lbs a.e.) is estimated for need.  This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in any product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
Product 6 is triclopyr ester formulated in appropriate solution (and potentially including surfactant).  A total of 1775 gallons of the 4# a.e./gal formulation (traditional formulation = 7100 lbs a.e.) is estimated as needed.  This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
EPA requires that products be labeled for "site" of application.  Any product purchased from proposed contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.  Quoters must provide products meeting this label constraints or product will be returned at contractor's expense.
All quantities are estimated.  No obligation will exist until the Government places an order.  Orders will be made by credit card only.  Quoters must be set-up to receive payments by credit card.  Orders placed against the proposed contract must be delivered to one or a combination of the following states:  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.  A receipt of all orders placed under the proposed contract must be mailed to the Purchaser and Contracting Officer.  The proposed contract starting time will be on or around August 1, 2004.  Period of performance is one (1) year from date of contract award.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial applies without addenda.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML # 40015.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23 dated 5/5/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The LHBP has a need to purchase three(3)  Lots of the RML custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors  Commercial; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders  Commercial Items. FAR52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price.    Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.    Award will be based on the capability of the item offered to meet the above stated salient characteristics, delivery, price and past performance.  Offers may be mailed or faxed to the POC indicated above (Fax - 406-363-9376).  Offers must be submitted not later than 4:30 PM (MDST), 6/8/04.

General Information:  The U.S. Army Research Laboratory Weapons and Materials Research Directorate (WMRD) is a national scientific and engineering resource in weapons and materials technologies. The Directorate pursues research and technology development for enhancing the leth ality and survivability of US ground forces.  Research efforts span the gap between basic research that improves the understanding of scientific phenomena and technology generation that supports weapons system developments. Two autoclaves were purchased in  1988 for use by WMRD from Thermal Equipment Corporation and have had minor updates to computer system and software during this time.  The autoclaves are used for routine cure cycles of composite panels and adhesive bonding/joining.  Average use of the aut oclaves are between two and four times per week, anywhere from 5 to 12 hour runs.  The autoclaves are mostly used for simple ramps and soak times, but some applications need the capability to be cooled down to a certain temperature at very low cool rates d ue to thermal mismatch of materials.  The last step currently takes many hours to get to the final 5 to 10 degrees needed. Both systems are located at the Rodman Materials Building (Building 4600) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in Lab 1006.  The smal l clave and some of its works are completely located inside, whereas the large clave has two-thirds of the shell outside.  Also, other hardware, cooling tower, water storage tank, vaporizer, compressors, etc., are outside facing such elements as high humid ity, rain, snow, wind, etc.  A roof and wall were erected to help protect the equipment against rain and snow.

RESEARCH INTEREST SPECIFICS

A.  INTRODUCTION

This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Concept and Technology Development Division, Enterprise Management Program Office, of the Air Armament Center (AAC/YEC), Eglin AFB FL, under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.

AAC/YEC contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology.  This BAA is intended to cover the research area of interest only to this Division as an unrestricted solicitation.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AAC/YEC should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate the AAC/YEC Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AAC/YEC may have in a specific research project.  The aggregate value of all procurement actions as a result of this BAA will not exceed $800K.  AAC/YEC plans to award two firm fixed-price contracts of not more than $400K each, but reserves the right to award more or less than two, or none.  Proposals may be submitted at any time before 15 Aug 2004.  However, prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are required to submit a two to three page white paper on their proposed research topic no later than 15 Jul 2004.  The white paper should also address data rights associated with the research, current security clearances of key personnel and facilities, and the proposed total contract price with a summary by major cost element, i.e., labor, materials, travel, overhead, G&A and profit.  A detailed breakdown is not needed nor requested.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Armament Center, Concept and Technology Development Division, AAC/YEC, Attn: Mr. Ron Rapp, 207 West D Ave, Suite 301, Bldg 349, Eglin AFB FL 32542, or email to aacyec@eglin.af.mil .   The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a formal proposal.  The formal proposal shall be IAW Part II.  Such invitation, however, does not assure that a contract will be awarded.  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received for immediate negotiation or held for consolidated evaluation. 

Note there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA. 

This BAA will remain open until 15 Aug 2004.  It may be superceded prior to that date and may be amended at any time. 

B. MISSION

The Concept and Technology Development Division, Enterprise Management Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC/YEC) is the primary Air Force organization concerned with future air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions technology development.  AAC/YEC works hand-in-hand with the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Weapons to formulate the Air Armament Roadmap.  AAC/YEC conducts Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations, plans for and executes research, development, and test of future munitions, conducts pre-Milestone B risk reduction activities, and facilitates transition of munitions technology to System Program Offices.  

C. PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREA 

The following narrative provides an abbreviated description of the prospective research area mentioned briefly in the ABSTRACT.  The description is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit innovative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered penetrating munition paradigms.  The description furnishes specific examples of areas of interest.  However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.  

HEAVY PENETRATOR NAVIGATION, GUIDANCE, & CONTROL TECHNOLOGY RISK REDUCTION 

The Department of Defense (DoD) is conducting research in the area of air delivered heavy penetrator weapons in an effort to address shortfalls in capabilities to reach very hard and deeply buried targets, including navigation, guidance and control (NG&C) in GPS disrupted or denied environments, and weapon system integration.  In order to address the DoD requirement for high reliability, tightly controlled impact, heavy penetrator precision NG&C, AAC/YEC is taking steps to initiate risk reduction study contracts.  Research proposals aimed at investigating weapon development or modification of existing weapons in the 5000-7000 pound weight class for hard target penetration and precision guidance are of particular interest as a means of reducing overall program risk.  Study contract program objectives are as follows: 

1.	Define heavy penetrator NG&C conceptual system architecture to include potential guidance scheme, hardware components, surety, packaging and configuration, weight, size, expected performance and operating characteristics. 

2.	Define the trade space associated with designing, producing, and fielding a highly reliable, precision guided heavy penetrator weapon system.

3.	Identify and define the critical risk areas associated with system development and aircraft integration.

4.	Develop a schedule and a rough estimate of cost for system development and integration and average unit procurement price.

(Small business offerors do not have to submit the plan.)  Offerors are cautioned that the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, and WOSB concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Subcontracting plans which provide for less than the aforementioned goal must be accompanied by sufficient evidence that all reasonable attempts to meet the 5% goal have been made.  Acceptable plans will be included in resultant contracts.

(3)  If information contained in the proposal is in the public domain or cannot be protected under law as a trade secret (e.g., a patent application), the Air Force will not accept liability for failure to safeguard against open disclosure.  If a responder wishes to restrict the proposal, the responder should mark the title page with the following legend:

“This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, provided that if a contract is awarded to this BAA responder as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  

The pages to which the above restriction applies shall be marked with the following legend:

	“Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title 	page of this proposal.”

Offerors should indicate in their proposal submission that they are in the process of obtaining this information.

(5)  Offerors are required to register in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of any contract (DFAR 252.204-7004).  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

(6)  As a minimum, all offerors will be required to submit monthly financial and technical status reports and a final technical report.  Depending on the duration of the program, offerors may be required to prepare semiannual and/or annual interim reports.  The Government negotiator will work out an appropriate Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with each successful offeror unless a CDRL is not appropriate.

B.  The technical portion of the proposal, Volume 1, should contain the following:
1.	A title and abstract that includes a concise Statement of Work and basic approaches to be utilized.  The Statement of Work should indicate the effort intended for each period of research.
2.	A reasonably complete discussion stating the background and objectives of the proposed work, the approaches to be considered, and the resources to be employed.

4.	The names of federal, state, local agencies or other parties receiving the proposals and/or funding the proposed effort of a similar nature. If none, so state.
5.	The identity of facilities, specialized equipment, or other real property to be used for the work, if appropriate for an understanding of the technical work to be conducted.
6.	Identify all on-going Government contracts and related past contracts or assistance instruments.  Provide a technical point of contact and telephone number for each contract cited.

C.  The cost portion of the proposal, Volume 2, should contain the following as applicable:

4.	Other direct costs by type, amount, cost per unit and purpose.  Specifically identify any costs for printing and publication and computers.
5.	A monthly expenditure plan and a disbursement rate report are required and may be included in the financial report.  The disbursement report must include the forecast of billings to the Government and the total cumulative amounts billed through the report month.
6.	State whether you are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business, HUBZONE small business, Veteran-owned business, nonprofit, educational, or historically black college or university.

7.	Anything of extra value to the program, for example, the results of internally funded research applicable to this BAA’s research objectives.
8.	Other terms and conditions, if any.

D.  Negotiation of your proposal will be accomplished through the review, discuss, concur (RDC) process via phone, video teleconferencing (VTC) or face-to-face discussions.  To facilitate this process, draft proposals must be submitted in accordance with the government’s instructions at the time your proposal is requested.

E.  Unpriced options will not be considered for award.

F.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

G.  The general scope for a program resulting from this BAA is a limited research program, generally a feasibility study.  The program should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort.  White papers/proposals for research in amounts normally up to approximately $350-400K may be submitted at any time under this BAA.

H.  Refer to the "Proprietary Information" and "When and How to Submit" sections of Air Force Material Command Unsolicited Proposal Guide, AFMC Pamphlet 64-101.  The AFMC Form 190 is not applicable to BAAs. The guide is available at the following web site:
  http://www.afmc-pub.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkp/pkpa/unsolpub.htm

I.  Responders should reference YEC-BAA-04-0001 and contact name.  Proposals should be sent to the contracting officer specified at the time proposals are requested.  This announcement is open and effective until superceded.  Those who propose are warned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to obligate the government.

 


PART III 

PROPOSAL EVALUATION 

A.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals unless specifically stated in a BAA amendment (See Part II, paragraph I.).

1.	An integrated assessment of the proposed approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, and associated risks, the potential contributions of the effort to the AAC/YEC mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this division’s overall research program.
2.	The offeror's capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
3.	The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and the availability of funds.
4.	Additional contractual terms and conditions proposed by the offeror, if any.

B.  Upon receipt of a proposal, the AAC/YEC technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort.  Offerors whose proposals the government considers as not having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those for which funds are not available, will be declined by written notice from the government.  Any such declination is not subject to appeal or further review.

C.  It is the policy of AAC/YEC to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified personnel from within the Government.  

D.  Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AAC/YEC program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

<DESC>This procurement requires the vendor to provide charter airlines service for the Artesia Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule.  The Aircraft proposed must accommodate a minimum of 120 passengers, must meet the industry standard for commercial flights with the exception of beverage/snack service and be in compliance with all FAA inspections, regulations and safety requirements for a commercial airliner. Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area.  The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations.  The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times.  The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carriers regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas: Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT.  The airline must provide for check in service at the International Airport.  The FLETC will provide a manifest to the airline each Friday no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT.  If there is space available, then any government employee on official travel may provide proper identification and travel orders at the gate and the airline will allow that individual to travel.  The FLETC in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration will provide security screening for all students departing from Roswell to the International Airport selected.  The FLETC will also provide for the loading of baggage at the Roswell Airport on to the return flight, however this only relates to the placing of the bags from the secure area to the aircraft.  The Airline will be responsible for securing all baggage within the hold and is responsible for all damage after it is placed inside the aircraft. The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights.  Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 --Evaluation - Commercial Items.  A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry.  The offeror’s proposal shall state the minimum safety and insurance requirements that are required by law and shall provide information that they meet these requirements.  Failure to meet this requirement will exclude the offeror from consideration.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerers in descending order of importance: (1) the offerors ability to meet the requirements in the SOW; (2) the offerors strategy to meet scheduled arrival and departure times given the availability of aircraft, flightworthiness of aircraft, etc; (3) an evaluation of past performance; and (4) price.  Technical and past performance, when combined, is of significantly higher importance than price in this evaluation. The evaluation criteria can be reviewed by contacting Art Welton at 505-746-5782 or emailing him at art.welton@dhs.gov.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is HSFLR040023.  The proposal shall include this number and include a narrative on technical factors 1, 2 and 3 and should provide enough detail so that the Government can evaluate technical performance.  Regarding past performance, the proposal should include a minimum of two contacts, if available, for two different charter airline service contracts performed by the offeror. This point of contact information should be on a currently available contact and should provide the preferred time, place and phone number for the Government to use when contacting that individual.

<DESC>The following questions were received from interested parties. Note: Interested parties are reminded to use Amendment 1 posted on the DCCW home page as the solicitation. The RFQ date remains the same, May 27, 2004 12 NOON. Q1. Please inform whether there is a significant difference between how we need to respond to this RFQ vs responding to an RFP. It is my understanding that you will need both a quotation and a technical proposal detailing how we will fulfill this contract if awarded it, much like an RFP would require. A1. Both a quotation and a technical proposal shall be submitted Q2.   I have not seen any request for samples of previous work similar in scope to that described in the solicitation. Do you want to see any samples at this point?  A2.	No Q3. Are all responses due to you via email or via postal mail? If via postal mail, how many copies are required and do you need pricing and technical proposals separated? 	 A3. Email proposals are acceptable Q4. In the list of CLINs, what does FFP stand for?  A4. Firm Fixed Price. See FAR Part 16 for Contract Types.  Q5. Under CLIN 0001 should we enter the sum of 0001AA through 0001AH or is there some other number you require here? If so, what should we base that on?  A5. CLIN 0001 would be the total of the subclins 0001AA-0001AH. CLIN0002 would be the total for 0002AA-0002AB and so forth. See amendment 1 for solicitation re-issue.  Q6. Some of the CLIN sub-categories are a little confusing. I understand you need the maximum figures based on approximately 12 to a maximum of 27 web events in a 12 year contract. Some of your 0001 category CLINs indicate numbers based on multiples of 12 and others use multiples of 27. Is this intentional and if so, please expound upon what we need to consider for CLIN 0003 which indicates a maximum figure of 19,440. I am confused about what is being requested in particular for this CLIN. Does this refer t o licensing the interface over a period of time? A6. The MAX QUANTITY for CLIN 0001AG and CLIN 0002AA should reflect 27 vice 48.  The 19,400 minutes in CLIN 0003 represents the total number of presentation minutes available online for the 12 month period of performance, for approximately 60 minute averag e events with a maximum of 27 events (12 X 60 X 27 = 19,400). This reflects licensing the interface based on content available over a period of time. Q7. Are the transcripts only required in English or will you need multiple languages transcribed, such as Spanish? A7. Transcripts are only required in English. Q8. CLIN 0006 asks for pricing of video taping. There are no further details about this though and so pricing can vary greatly depending on what's needed. For example, would shooting require one half day, one full day, several days in a row? Will any editi ng be required for on-demand events? Will the shoot require one, two or more cameras and will sound need to cover a panel of presenters or one speaker at a podium, perhaps with an audience and questions and answers. Conversely, will speaking be in a contro lled studio with no audience and one camera only required? In order to answer this question as accurately as possible, please let us know the parameters you would like us to use for supplying quotes and if you have any on-line samples of what is typical ac cessible, this could be very helpful. A8. Generally, events will be in the National Capital Region.  They will consist of a single speaker needing one camera.  During question and answer sessions, viewing the audience will not be necessary, but hearing the audience will be necessary.  The even t will normally last sixty (60) minutes.  Samples are not available.  Due to the variety of venues in the NCR, complexities may vary event to event. Q9. In section 4.3, p. 14 under TASKS, a Web-based Client interface is required. Is it the OFT's intention to have the contractor build a proprietary portal-like interface allowing web presentation users to search an  archive of all web presentations that will be the result of this contract? Is this interface intended to be for all archived events, whether originally live or on-demand?  A9. All events (live and on-demand) will be available through a web-based interface provided by the vendor via the Internet.  Searching should be available across all archives and within each archive. Q10. I have not seen any CLIN referencing satellite time in association with the live event web casts so we can deliver the event back to our servers for serving up events live. Is this figure something we should just include in the base price in 0005? A10. All costs for conducting a live event shall be included in the base price. Q11.CLIN 0005AC requests quotes for a 'publishing fee' for the live events. Should we take this to include all costs from the point of sending the mixed/switched signal via satellite (from above) through to serving up the live event to the audience over th e net?  A11. Yes.  Q12. Will there be a separate travel budget considered if we need to send crew to different locations or should itemized CLIN pricing be inclusive of travel time?   A12. All costs shall be included in the base price of the appropriate CLIN. The government does not anticipate travel outside of the National Capital Region.  Q13. On page 16 under section 52.212-2 (b) there is a reference to 'options', which are being evaluated by OFT to determine best value. I am unclear as to what these options are. Does this mean the optional extension periods after the initial 12-month cont ract or rather does this refer to the CLIN subsets (such as 0001AA, AB, AC etc.) or something different again? A13. This requirement is for a Base Period of 12 months and four, twelve month option periods. Solicitation has been re-issued to reflect the option period CLINS. See Amendment 1. Reference FAR Part 17 for explanation on option periods.   Q14. We work in partnership with a company that has complimentary services to ours and for the purposes of fulfilling this contract as required by OFT it would be necessary to work in tandem (production services in tandem with webcasting services). We inte nd that one company will be the single point of services, payments etc. to ensure the best service. As such, will this arrangement be acceptable to OFT given the Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government with Alternate I FAR clause has been che cked by the contracting officer? A14. 52.203-6 does not restrict teaming or subcontractor. FAR Part 19 for subcontracts and FAR Part 3.503-2 which prescribes clause 52.203-6.  Q15. In section 4.1.2 under TASKS, it is required to be able to handle slide build outs and animated slide transitions. Technically it is possible to do this though it often ends up making the slide synchronization problematic. Is it acceptable to provide a work-around design to these build outs or help prepare an approximate simulation to these build outs and transitions when we convert slides? A15. As long as the intent of the slide is represented, alternates/simulations of the slide would be acceptable. Q16. Please elaborate about the table of contents. Specifically are you after a TOC such as: 	1.) May 17 conference 	2.) June 3 Conference 	3.) July 11 Conference 	etc. Or are you after a more detailed TOC detailing each  conference such as 	1.) May 17 Conference 		a.) Opening remarks 		b.) Presentation by xyz 		c.) round table discussion etc. A16. The table of contents is intended to be seen within the interface of each event as described in the latter example above.  The table of contents will generally be broken down by slide/rich media title.  There should also be a table of contents availab le to reflect all events in the archive/library. Q17.How many concurrent viewers do you need to support and at what bandwidth? A17. It is not possible to determine the concurrent viewers required. The bandwidth required for media delive ry should reflect the capability of low and high bandwidth participants.   Q18. In section 4.3 you mention the ability to search across all OFT content and within an event. Please elaborate about the specific types of searches you have in mind.  A18. Searches should be based on keywords and include content from all slides/ transcripts.  When keywords are found and selected, all synchronized content should move to that point in the event. Q19. How long will each event typically last? A19. Sixty minutes. Q20. What is FFP?  A20. Firm Fixed Price. See FAR Part 16 for Contract Types Q21. Must the additional media mentioned in 4.1.3 appear in a separate frame within the viewing window? A21. Rich Media will typically be located in the portion of the interface that contains the slide content. Q22. What format will you accept the responses in such as Microsoft word? Wordperfect? Adobe pdf?  A22. Proposals are accepted in MS Word format.  Q23. Would the Closed Caption log serve as a transcript? It seems to me that the CC is for all practical purposes a transcript. Producing a separate and independent transcript will only add cost. A23. As long as the Closed Caption Log is synchronized with the Video during playback, it is alright to use the Closed Caption Log. Q24. What performance criteria for the online media delivery will be used and what metrics are used to measure video and presentation delivery performance?  Will there be a scale in technical capability or will it only be 'meets technical requirements or d oes not meet technical requirements'? A24. The criteria used for evaluation purposes is delineated in the Technical Evaluation Criteria published as part of this solicitation. Q25. As the amount of streams and the size of the audience can not be estimated, will a firm fixed price for specific usage amounts of streamed and hosted data be acceptable? A25. Yes.
