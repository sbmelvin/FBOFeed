"This is a request for quote only for a brand name specific product to a follow on contract". "This is a notice of the Government's intent to award on a sole source basis". This requirement will close on 30 March 2009 at 1200 hours Central Standard Time (CST). All submissions should be e-mailed to john.crowell@gunter.af.mil or linda.mitchell@gunter.af.mil. "An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilit! ate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract. The ESC Ombudsman is the ESC Director, Commander's Staff, and can be contacted at: ESC/DS Bldg 1606 9 Eglin Street Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 Telephone #: 781-377-5106 Facsimile #: 781-377-4659 E-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.

BRAND NAME UNIQUE JUSTIFICATION FOR Micro Focus Software Support FA8771-09-Q-0016 IWIMS system has a requirement to provide technical sup! port to maintain the legacy program for patches, upgrades and technical support which supports the Air Force's Civil Engineers. It is imperative that the developmental environment matches the operational environment to ensure completeness in testing. Without the purchase of this software and its associated maintenance, the required testing before fielding new software and/or system architecture changes would not be able to take place. This could adversely affect Civil Engineers Air Force-wide with the introduction of new software and/or system architecture changes that are not thoroughly tested. The Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied with the purchase of this hardware and maintenance. This purchase allows the developmental environment to match the operational environment. A failure to purchase specified software and maintenance would prevent the 754 ELSG from meeting current customer requirements of thoroughly tested changes to software and system architecture.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) This federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA), by the 551 Electronic Systems Group, Hanscom AFB, MA which intends to issue a contract to ADTRON Corporation, 4415 E. Cotton Center Blvd, Suite 100, Phoenix, AZ 85040, pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) entitled "One responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements"; FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c)1.
This proposed Sole Source acquisition will be for the following items: 3.5" Solid-State Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) Flash Disk Part Number: S35FA-1054CBD1, Quantity: Fifty (50). The flash disks are upgrade/replacement parts in support of the Radar Systems Improvement Program (RSIP) of the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft. The flash disks will replace the existing mechanical disks of the AWACS radar's Removable Memory Assembly (RMA), which is an integral component of the radar system.  The mechanical disks, which have reached the end of their serviceability period, are no longer manufactured and there are no sources for repair parts.  The 3.5"solid state SCSI disks were developed by ADTRON as replacement disks for the USAF AWACS fleet (ESC-USAF Contracts F1968-95-C-0041 & F19628-95-C-0042) and are form, fit and function with the RSAF AWACS radar system.  Since no other compatible disks are available, the Government ! has determined that an award to any other source other than the ADTRON Corporation would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling this Foreign Military Sales requirements. This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  In addition, this notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. 
Please direct any questions concerning this notice to the attention of David H. Hawkins, Contracting Officer, 551 ELSG/PK, 3 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2328, telephone 781-377-8357 or via e-mail: david.hawkins@hanscom.af.milADDITIONAL INFO:  3.5" Solid-State SCSI Flash Disk on HERBBCONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:  3 Eglin Street Bldg 1612, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2328POINT OF CONTACT:  Collin.manzo.ctr@hanscom.af.mil

<DESC>2009 AF SOA Developers ConferenceWednesday, May 20, 2009 - Thursday, May 21, 2009
The 2009 AF SOA Developers Conference will focus on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) collaboration and reuse capabilities in the Air Force and DoD. The development of service oriented capabilities poses increasing challenges for AF and DoD software engineering teams, which are often distributed geographically and organizationally. The discipline of AF and DoD software engineering must address these challenges through the development and refinement of new collaborative and reuse techniques, processes, and tools that build upon sound engineering principles. Moreover, the ubiquity of software means that the discipline of AF and DoD software engineering itself is also extending. Software engineering teams and organizations must think of IT components not only as a software or hardware products, but also as services that can be shared and reused across the enterprise.
This event will assemble a community of peers to exchange ideas and discuss what has worked, what did not work, and review best practices. Attendees will benefit from lessons learned in real world implementations. Sessions will provide key insights into developing, managing and governing SOA related collaborative and reuse capabilities within the AF and DoD.

The instrument will continue the measurement of theice, cloud, and land elevation of the Earth, especially at the polar areas, which wasachieved by the GLAS instrument of ICESat-I until last year.  The APD is a key componentin the ATLAS instrument.  It converts the optical pulse of the laser altimeter into anelectrical pulse with high fidelity.  This enables the precise measurement of the opticalpulse traveling time, which gives the elevation of the ground and the ice.  The APDdetector from Perkin-Elmer is the only one on the market that meets the ICESat-IIdetector requirements with flight and space qualification heritage.Perkin-Elmer is the manufacturer of APD detectors that meet all of the requirements,especially the excess noise factor, which is a critical parameter that determines theamplitude variation of the electrical pulses, contributing to the elevation measurementaccuracy.  In addition, the Perkin-Elmer detectors have been fully space qualified, havesuccessfully flown on the ICESat-I mission and meet all of the design requirements forthe ATLAS instrument for the ICESat-II mission.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO  Accenture LLP for the reasons described below.  The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) program was created as a part of the Trade Act of 2002 to provide eligible individuals health insurance tax credits.  Under this effort, the current HCTC program is being expanded to meet legislative mandated due dates resulting from the recent enactment of the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (PL 111-05), also known as the Stimulus Bill.  The ARRA includes provisions that change the administration of the HCTC program and significantly expand the volume of taxpayers claiming the credit.  Award of a modification to a previously competed task order under the authority of FAR 16.505 utilizing the IRS TIPSS-3 Program is planned.  The legislation does not allow for any ramp up period as it requires development & implementation within 60 days of its enactment.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS),  plans to procure on a sole source basis with Oxford University Press, Great Clarendon St., Oxford UK 0X2 6DP.    The contractor shall provide a supplement to the Journal of the NCI (JNCI) on Coordinating Care Across the Cancer Continuum.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>The purpose of this supplement is to summarize the state of our knowledge about the interfaces among providers of the types of care needed for cancer and what we know about how health care and the community context affects  those interfaces and the types of care. We use the issue of interfaces to raise the point that concentrating on guidelines for types of care like screening, diagnostic procedures, surgery and treatment will not be sufficient to improve the quality of cancer care overall. The goal of the supplement is to identify where research should be directed in the future to improve the quality of cancer care.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source contract to QINETIQ, MOD Pendine Range, Llanmiloe Carmarthen SA33 4UA, Carmarthenshire UK for explosive test range support at the Pendine Sands Test Range in the United Kingdom for underwater testing of a large (2,000 lb) explosive device. This procurement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. NSWC PCD requires a Very Shallow Water (VSW) site (15 to 40 foot water depth) that has a tidal range sufficient to permit test setup on dry land and then the ability to conduct the test underwater. The Pendine Sands range was selected as the most suitable candidate since the tidal variation at that site allows for set up of the test on dry land, and then conduct an 18 to 24 foot depth test at high tide.  All other test range options require a longer time period to prepare (site prep or environmental assessments) with resulting delays in program schedule!  and higher costs.  QinetiQ is the only possible source that can provide this testing range.  Challenges to this sole source procurement should provide their range specifications and data to the Contract Specialist by email only at Stacy.Figlinski@navy.mil.  The period of performance is planned to be for 120 days after award. NAICS Code 541380 applies. Size standard is $12,000,000. FSC B541.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to advise interested companies that the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division (NCD), on behalf of the US Marine Corps (USMC) Program Manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Systems (PM CBRN Systems) plans to conduct a:<BR><BR>PRE SOLICITATION CONFERENCE at the US Army Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), Natick, MA,  on May 20, 2009 to discuss an upcoming acquisition as described below.  <BR><BR>Further information regarding this event will be forthcoming.  This is a mark your calendar announcement.<BR><BR>-----<BR><BR>Synopsis of proposed acquisition  <BR><BR>The USMC has an ongoing requirement to provide health care services to all of its deployed members, as part of its commitment to meet operational requirements and for the general health and well being of its forces.  These services include preventive medical and dental care and critical medical care.   To meet this requirement, the USMC provides its Medical and Dental Battalions and unit medical personnel with authorized medical and dental supplies and equipment (Class VIII equipment) necessary to treat patients in operational and field environments.  Historically, this service has been managed directly by the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Family of Field Medical Equipment (FFME) within PM CBRN Systems.  In an effort to improve these services, and to conserve scarce Marine Corps resources that would otherwise be required to execute this process, PM CBRN Systems has elected to outsource the procurement, supply chain management, and associated support activities through a prime vendor contract to procure equipment contained in the USMC Authorized Medical Allowance Lists (AMALs), Authorized Dental Allowance List (ADALs) and medical kits.  <BR><BR>AMALs and ADALs are highly specialized capability sets comprised of Class VIII (DoD classification for medical materiel to include medical peculiar repair parts) materiel.  The FFME Team, PM CBRN Systems centrally manages and controls the configuration of AMALs and ADALs and medical kits for the Marine Corps.  The USMC currently maintains 30 separate AMALs/ADALs and four medical kits.  Each AMAL/ADAL and medical kit contains a list of specific commercially available equipment, supplies, repair parts, tools, and Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) to provide a specific medical capability.  <BR><BR>The Government requires performance of a broad set of tasks relating to AMAL and ADAL and medical kit procurements and management, including, but not limited to:  <BR>	maintaining awareness of contents and changes to AMAL/ADAL equipment lists<BR>	supply chain management<BR>	online catalog, delivery order preparation and total asset visibility system<BR>	procurement of AMAL/ADAL equipment and supplies<BR>	customer support services<BR>	regulatory and safety services<BR>	equipment calibration, maintenance, repair, shelf life and lifecycle management<BR>	Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty management<BR>	meetings and reviews<BR><BR>At this time, the Governments contracting strategy entails award of a single prime vendor type contract, 3 years duration, approximately $100 Million, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for AMAL/ADAL and medical kit equipment, and time and materials for prime vendor services and support.  <BR><BR>A draft Request for Proposals (RFP) will be forthcoming within the next two (2) weeks, and announced on this site.  Interested companies will be provided an opportunity to review the draft RFP and provide comments and questions that will discussed at the pre-solicitation conference.  Additional background information will also be provided as the process evolves.  <BR><BR>Technical Point of Contact:  allen.schweizer@usmc.mil<BR><BR>Contracting Point of Contact:  peter.wallace@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>The Coast Guard intends to solicit, negotiate and award a sole source procurement using procedures FAR Part 13.5 test programs for Commercial items to San Francisco International Airport, P.O. Box 8097, San Francisco, CA 94128.   The Coast Guard requires: telecommunications structured cabling infrastructure, network operations center services, and two digital signal level three (DS3) circuits for CG Air Station located at the San Francisco Airport. There will be the initial installation plus 4 one year options that may be exercised for the recurring services and maintenance support. These services require single mode fiber optic cabling or broadband coaxial cabling with at least two separate DS3 circuits from the main point of entry (MPOE) at the San Francisco International Airport to the Coast Guard Telecommunications room at the administration building at the San Francisco airport.  

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The SFO Airport Authority ITT is the only service provider that provides structured cabling pathways and fiber optic cabling for customers at the San Francisco Airport. The Coast Guard contacted AT&T, the Local Exchange Carrier, and only other service provider we know provides these services for SFO International Airport Authority customers.  AT&T told the Coast Guard that all structured cabling and infrastructure was turned over to the SFO International Airport Authority in 1998 as result of a Public Utility Commission decision regarding all telecommunications structured cabling and infrastructure.  The San Francisco International Airport Authority is uniquely qualified as the only service provider because they own the cabling and pathway facilities at the SFO airport.  No other service provider has access to the San Francisco Airport Authority cabling and infrastructure facilities. When asked for other service providers, the San Francisco Airport Authority responded that no other service providers are allowed usage of their structured cabling infrastructure or facilities.
This is not a request for quotation, however interested parties may identify themselves and their capacity to satisfy this Coast Guard requirement, if no responses are received within 7 days negotiations will be conducted with SF Airport. No telephone inquiries.

<SUBJECT>BRUSHLESS SURGICAL HAND SCRUB
<SOLNBR>APP-1-9-10-0901-01
<RESPDATE>041709
<CONTACT>Cynthia Ingrao, Phone 619-532-8517, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC><p>A. General Information</p>
<p>The Northeast &amp; Southwest Regions comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia and California announce a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Brushless Surgical Hand Scrub. The regions recognize vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category. A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Regions and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. In order to meet the total requirements of the Regions a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs' needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes brushless surgical hand scrub that does not require the use of a brush or sponge. The scrub must contain ingredients that significantly reduce microorganisms on intact skin; contain a nonirritating, antimicrobial preparation; be broad spectrum; be fast acting, and have a persistent effect per methodology specified by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) Protocol for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products (21 CFR Parts 333 and 369, Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products; Proposed Rule).</p>
<p>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Owens &amp; Minor and Cardinal, currently serving the Northeast Region and Southwest Region, respectively.</p>
<p>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit's (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory. The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.</p>
<p>The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare Network, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.</p>
<p>The major facilities in the Southwest Region include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's Prime vendor program and how to obtain a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.</p>
<p>The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2009. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.</p>
<p>Point of Contact:<br />Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN at (619) 532-8517; Email- cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil</p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required</p>
<p>The Northeast and Southwest Regions are seeking product line items in the category of Brushless Surgical Hand Scrub. The product category includes brushless surgical hand scrub that does not require the use of a brush or sponge. The scrub must contain ingredients that significantly reduce microorganisms on intact skin; contain a nonirritating, antimicrobial preparation; be broad spectrum; be fast acting, and have a persistent effect per methodology specified by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) Protocol for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products (21 CFR Parts 333 and 369, Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products; Proposed Rule). Within these two Regions, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $68,595. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>At the request of the Northeast &amp; Southwest Regions Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. Vendors may be asked to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to the test sites. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the product. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature electronically to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than April 17, 2009. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed. Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PDST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified. If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:</p>
<p>Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN <br />Tri-Service Regional Business Office <br />MSMMO - Southwest Region <br />34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 <br />San Diego, CA 92134 <br />Phone: (619) 532-8517</p>
<p>Toni Massenberg, RN<br />Walter Reed Army Medical Center<br />Tri-Service Regional Business Office<br />Building 1, Suite C330<br />6900 Georgia Avenue, NW<br />Washington, DC 20307-5001<br />Phone: (202) 782-3666</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Northeast and Southwest Regions. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<br />Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.</p>
<p>The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria<br />1. Your company must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of brushless surgical hand scrub that does not require the use of a brush or sponge. The scrub must contain ingredients that significantly reduce microorganisms on intact skin; contain a nonirritating, antimicrobial preparation; be broad spectrum; be fast acting, and have a persistent effect. <br />2. Your product must meet FDA requirements as outlined in the Tentative Final Monograph. The FDA requires that products for surgical hand scrubs provide a one-log reduction on day one, a two-log reduction on day two, a three-log reduction on day five, and show persistent activity for at least six hours on each of the three test days.<br />3. Provide the brand(s) under which your company manufactures or distributes your products.<br />4. Provide the volumes your product is available and how the product is packaged to avoid contamination of the unused product and prevent fire hazards if your product contains a flammable ingredient.<br />5.

Your company must have a DAPA number for this product line or you will be disqualified from the standardization process. Please provide the DAPA number for this product line.<br />18. Your company must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.

Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents. If your company has not had any of the above, so state.</p>
<p>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process<br />The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs. Vendors will be given 21 calendar days from the issue of the notice to deliver literature and samples. Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM local time, on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process (all vendors must send TRBO verification regarding date of shipment).</p>
<p>The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the "break", in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.</p>
<p>A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation<br />1. The method of product dispensing is acceptable and the solution is easily dispensed from the dispenser. Clinicians need the product to be dispensed in a method that is hands free and does not involve handling bottles to prevent contamination of the dispenser by the clinician's hands and vice versa. The product needs to dispense easily from the dispenser to prevent contamination and assist in completing the surgical scrub quickly. <br />a. The product is removed from the dispenser easily and quickly without the clinician having to touch the dispenser.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the dispenser at least 2 times.<br />c. The evaluator using the dispenser will obtain product from the dispenser without touching it and the product will be dispensed quickly.</p>
<p>2. The dispenser does not leak. Clinicians do not want a dispenser that leaks the product on table top surfaces, sinks or floors. Product that is leaked on a working surface or the floor can be unsightly and hazardous to health and safety because of possible chemical exposure in the form of vapors.<br />a. The dispenser will be mounted to a wall in the evaluation area or to a manufacturer designed floor stand for a period long enough to determine if the dispenser leaks.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting for a minimum of 36 hours.<br />c. The evaluator will directly observe the dispenser and examine it for leaks as evidenced by product being outside of the dispenser and in the immediate area or on the dispenser.</p>
<p>3. The manufacture's instructions for use are easy to understand and prevent confusion. Clinicians need easy to understand instructions of use to insure the product is used correctly and they get the results they expect.<br />a. The manufacture's instructions for use are clearly written on the product dispenser in easy to use steps.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.<br />c. The evaluator will carefully read the product label for the manufacturer's instructions of use. The expectation is that the instructions will be easily and clearly understood and the evaluator will get the expected result from the product.</p>
<p>4. The drying time of the product is within the time stated by the manufacturer and acceptable to the clinician. Excessive drying time interferes with the donning of surgical gloves and subsequent commencement of the surgical procedure.<br />a. The product will dry in accordance with the stated drying time and be acceptable to the clinician.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product and a timer, watch or clock at least 2 times.<br />c. The evaluator will directly observe for the anticipated drying time. The expectation is that the product will dry in accordance with the product literature and be acceptable to the evaluator.</p>
<p>5. The product does not have an unpleasant odor. Clinicians require the products they use have a pleasant odor or no odor at all. Odors and fragrances can be irritating and sometimes cause allergic reactions.<br />a. The product will not give off an unpleasant odor as perceived by the clinician.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 1 time.<br />c. The evaluator will dispense the product, use it as directed and then note if there is an unpleasant odor. The expectation is that the product will not initiate an allergic reaction to the evaluator.</p>
<p>6. The product does not leave an unpleasant residue. Clinicians require the product not leave an unpleasant residue on the skin. Residues can be irritating to the skin or cause interaction reactions with gloves. Residues also create a sense of discomfort that compels the clinician to wash with water to remove it, which negates the intended use.<br />a. The product will not leave an unpleasant residue on the skin of the clinician.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.<br />c. The evaluator will dispense the product, use it as directed and then note if there is an unpleasant residue. The expectation is that the product will not leave or build up an unpleasant residue on the skin of the evaluator. The evaluator will not be compelled to wash the skin with water.</p>
<p>7. The product does not dry; cause irritation to or breakdown the skin. Clinicians do not want a product that dries the skin, causes irritation to the skin or breaks the skin down. Compromise of skin integrity makes it easy for microbes to enter the system and cause infection.<br />a. The product will not dry the skin, cause irritation to the skin or breakdown the skin of the clinician.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.<br />c. The evaluator will dispense the product, use it as directed and then note if the skin is dry, irritated or becoming fragile which make cause skin breakdown. The expectation is that the product will not cause any discomfort to the skin of the evaluator.</p>
<p>8. It is easy to don surgical gloves after use of the product. Clinicians require the donning of surgical gloves after use of a surgical scrub be smooth and fast taking only seconds to complete from start to finish.<br />a. The product, after it is dried, allows the clinician to don surgical gloves in a smooth and efficient manner.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting after the product has been applied according to manufacture's instructions and donning a pair of surgical gloves at least 1 time.<br />c. The evaluator will dispense the product, use it as directed and then don a pair of surgical gloves. The expectation is that the product will not cause the surgical gloves to adhere or catch on the skin of the evaluator thereby making the donning of the gloves cumbersome and inefficient.</p>
<p>9. The product cleans off surfaces easily. During use, products can fall or be splashed on surfaces near the dispenser or the clinician using the product. Clinicians prefer products that do not damage the surfaces of counters, sinks, floors or equipment.<br />a. The product will not damage the surfaces of counters, sinks, floors or equipment.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by reviewing literature and the manufacturer's warranty on the use of the product for information that states the product is safe on all surfaces and if damage occurs to the surface, the manufacturer will replace the damaged surface.<br />c. The evaluator will read literature provided by the manufacturer and determine if the desired warranty information is included. The expectation is that the literature will contain the needed information that the product is safe for all surfaces.</p>
<p><br />Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process<br />All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Northeast Region. Failure to respond within the timeframe will result in disqualification. <br />The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price will become more important. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be excluded from RIA award consideration.</p>

<DESC><p>A. General Information
<p>Southwest Region seeks approval to standardize Disposable Underpads of various sizes and absorbencies for its Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in California. This standardization action for this product line is a "re-compete" initiative for the Southwest Region as the existing RIA is already on its 5th and last year. It is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection; however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. This product line includes Disposable Underpads of various sizes and absorbencies.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region.</p>
<p>The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2009. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.</p>

<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required</p>
<p>The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Underpads of various sizes and absorbencies. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $125,000. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than April 17, 2009. Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PDST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified. If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:</p>
<p>Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN <br />Tri-Service Regional Business Office <br />MSMMO - Southwest Region <br />34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 <br />San Diego, CA 92134 <br />Phone: (619) 532-8517</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer. We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.<br />Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria<br />1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Disposable Underpads for use with adult and pediatric patients. A &lsquo;complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs' requirements for &lsquo;usage items' in the product line. &lsquo;Usage items' are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, this includes disposable absorbent under-pads (fluff and layered) with a protective back sheet available in various sizes, with underpad dimensions ranging from a length of 17 inches to 36 inches and a width ranging from 22 inches to 70 inches. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed. <br />2. Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.<br />3. Your products must be hypoallergenic and low lint and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.<br />4. Your products must be flame retardant as required by federal law.<br />5. Your products must pull moisture away from the body.<br />6. Your products must be absorbent enough to prevent leakage of fluids and solids.<br />7. Your products must be strong enough to resist tearing for overnight use.<br />8. Your products must have a moisture-proof, soft backing that protects bedding, chairs and wheel chairs.<br />9. Your packaging must make it easy for the user to identify the type and size of the product.<br />10. Your products must be available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health, or you will be disqualified from the standardization process. Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<br />11. Your company must have a DAPA number for this product line or you will be disqualified from the standardization process. Please provide the DAPA number for this product line.<br />12. Your company must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<br />13. Educational tools or materials in the form of written, audio and/or visual must be provided for this product line. Please state how your company will meet this requirement.<br />14. Your company must provide staff training for this product line if requested. Please state how your company will meet this requirement.<br />15. Please provide a list of product representatives for each account in the Southwest Region.<br />16. Please provide your company's returned goods policy.<br />17. Please provide an implementation plan for servicing the supply requirements of the Southwest Region.<br />18. Please annotate the hours that customer service support is accessible via a toll-free number. 24 hours/day, 7 days/week support is preferable. If your company does not provide preferable level of support, state the hours support is provided.<br />19. Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents. If your company has not had any of the above, so state.</p>
<p>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM PDST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.</p>
<p>The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The evaluations are conducted a clinical setting. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the "break", in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.</p>
<p>A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria<br />1. The underpad's backing protects linen from wetness. Clinicians use underpads to protect linen from wetness. <br />a. The underpad's ability to protect linen from wetness will also protect the patient from contact with from bodily fluids.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting three (3) times.<br />c. The evaluator will inspect the patient's linen and skin for signs of wetness during underpad use.</p>
<p>2. The underpad draws wetness away from patient's skin. <br />a. Drawing wetness away from patient's skin will help prevent skin breakdown/damage due to contact with bodily fluids.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting three (3) times. <br />c. During patient assessments the evaluator will inspect whether the patient's skin remains dry when the underpad is damp.</p>
<p>3. The underpad does not tear or fall apart during use. <br />a. An intact under pad protects the patient from skin irritation caused by bodily fluids.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting three (3) times. <br />c. The evaluator will visibly observe whether the underpad tears or falls apart when the patient repositions himself or the evaluator repositions the patient.</p>
<p>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.</p>

<a href="mailto:connie.m.houpt@faa.gov">connie.m.houpt@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)
It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $200,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
This requirement is available for full-and-open competition.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
The A&E firm's submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 
1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence-Offeror shall submit examples (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities utilized in each of the following areas: (i) environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit, (ii) pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects), (iii) environmental management system implementation (can include ISO 14001 implementation), and (iv) environmental remedial investigation and design (CERCLA) performed within the last ten (10) years.  These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort, their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables.)  Projects completed for the Federal Government, in particular, should be included, if any.
2. Past Performance-For each of the examples presented in response to Factor 1 above, offerors shall provide information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders.

Rsums of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is required.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty (30) days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.  Offeror shall provide documentation as to laboratory capability for one or more primary laboratories and one or more quality assu7rance laboratories.  Documentation should be sufficient to indicate that laboratory capabilities in such areas as analytical methodology, quality assurance and reporting are equivalent to those required of laboratories participating in the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP.)  Evidence of current participation, as a CLP laboratory, will be sufficient to meet this requirement.
4.

If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.
5. Geographic Location-The offeror's geographic location relative to the Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, will be evaluated in this element, with higher scores given to those firms closest to the Aeronautical Center.
6. Minority and Women Employment-The percentage of minority employees in all job classifications and pay scales, noting the percentage of minorities in the immediate locality and general surrounding area, and the number of women in all job classifications and pay scales, will be evaluated.

Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (April 23, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Complete submittals, both technical and cost proposals, must be received by the FAA, no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, April 23, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.

<DESC>ARCHAEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF SUBMERGED SITES ON THE GULF OF MEXICO OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELFSources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Notice
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Interior (DOI), Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement for Archaeological Analysis of Submerged Sites on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf.  This requirement is being issued as full and open in accordance with FAR Part 15 for competitive acquisitions.  This pre-solicitation notice is being published in accordance with FAR 15.202, entitled Advisory Multi-Step Process.  MMS/DOI intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study that evaluates the potential archaeological significance of at least six (6) probable historic shipwrecks in <130 feet of water.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541720, "Environmental Consulting Services".  In order to compete under this acquisition, interested parties must demonstrate they are capable of performing the work by providing a Capabilities Statement.  Instructions regarding submission of capabilities statements are contained herein.  Following review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements received from this announcement, the MMS reserves the right to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the list of those deemed best qualified.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition.  Please note that it is not the Governments intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a pre-solicitation for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the MMS.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements.  The Government anticipates to competitively award of a cost plus fixed fee contract for this study with an estimated total amount of between $225,000 and $275,000.   The anticipated period of performance is two years (24 months).PURPOSE:  The objectives of this study are to ground-truth, positively identify, and assess the potential National Register significance of at least six probable shipwreck sites by conducting a Phase II investigation of each of the targets and associated debris fields as defined in National Register Bulletin 15: How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation (1991) available online at http://www.cr.nps.gov/NR/publications/bulletins/nrb15/.  Analysis of site formation processes at each site should be conducted to provide recommendations of potential avoidance criteria for shallow-water shipwreck sites.  Services required for this study will include, but not be limited to, archival and historical research; archaeological and geomorphological remote sensing surveys (marine magnetometer and sidescan sonar, at a minimum); and diver site testing/evaluation.BACKGROUND:  The MMS is charged with the responsibility of considering the effects of its actions on significant cultural resources on the OCS of the United States, from state waters to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  This program arose out of a variety of legislation enacted to ensure proper management and protection of the nations cultural heritage.  The most pertinent of these laws are the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (as amended), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) of 1978.  In order to meet this responsibility, the MMS requires the oil and gas industry to conduct high-resolution remote sensing surveys in advance of any bottom-disturbing activities such as exploration drilling or pipeline construction and to submit an archaeological report analyzing these data.  While MMS has complied with Section 106 of the NHPA by requiring industry to conduct remote sensing surveys and avoid targets that may represent significant archaeological resources, minimal testing has been performed to ascertain the effectiveness of this mitigation strategy.  Ground-truthing targets that have been recommended for avoidance provides the MMS an opportunity to both evaluate the actual archaeological significance of the targets and to assess industry compliance with the MMS-stipulated avoidance criteria.SCOPE OF WORK:  Archaeological services are required to perform remote sensing surveys (magnetometer and sidescan sonar) and diver investigations of potential shipwreck sites in the Gulf of Mexico.  The location of the study area will include the Central and Western Planning areas of the Gulf of Mexico Region.  A minimum of six (6) sites have been selected for this study.  Specifically, the requirements are to:  (1) Conduct archaeological and geophysical remote sensing (magnetometer and sidescan sonar) surveys at each location to determine the current extent of these sites; (2) carry out diver investigations of these sites to document the current condition, develop a site plan, and collect video and still imagery for archaeological analysis of each site; (3) collect sediment cores to conduct site formation analysis at each of these sites; (4) analyze previously collected remote sensing data and newly acquired remote sensing data over each site to identify changes in site formation; (5) conduct archival and historical research on each of the sites; and  (6) submit a Final Report of Findings that includes analysis of all data collected.SOURCES SOUGHT:  In order to compete for this acquisition interested parties MUST submit a capabilities statement of not more than twenty (20) pages in length that demonstrates that they are qualified to perform the work by providing their capabilities in writing to the addresses as shown below: an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing key scientific and technical personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience.  Scientific personnel must possess the appropriate expertise to carry out this study.  Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of marine archaeology, history, and remote sensing.  The Principal Investigator must meet the Secretary of the Interiors Professional Qualification Standards for Archaeology as outlined in 36 CFR 61.  The Principal Investigator may serve as Project Manager.  Specific knowledge and experience required is as follows: (1) your organizational experience and facilities capable to perform the prescribed work; and (2) specific references including contract number and project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number and email address for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last five years (references will be checked).  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  Following review of all Capabilities Statements, we will establish a list of Offerors that are deemed most viable to perform the work.  All offerors will be contacted and be provided the result of the evaluation of their capabilities.  The Request for Proposal will be sent to those offerors deems most qualified.

<DESC>The Inorganic Materials Group at NIST requires large-scale experimental capacity for concrete research to complement its world-class theoretical and small-scale experimental expertise. To do this, a complete concrete laboratory, composed of several key components, must be obtained. Due to the fact that concrete is a composite material that depends on the environment and has properties that vary with time over periods of months to years, a complete concrete laboratory must have these components  no one device exists that can serve as a complete concrete laboratory. These components work together to make preparation and evaluation of concrete possible. The Inorganic Materials Group needs to routinely be able to: : (A) store large volumes of concrete-making materials (cement, sand, gravel), (B) store small volume materials and finished samples, (C) prepare materials, cure materials, and have long-time storage of materials in climate-controlled conditions, and evaluate materials in the fresh and hardened state at the (D) concrete component level (e.g. test cement and chemical admixture compatibility) and (E) at the finished, larger concrete specimen level (e.g. mechanical properties and durability of 150 mm x 300 mm concrete cylinders). In the following equipment list, each component is marked A, B, C, D, or E to show how what part it plays in the Advanced Concrete Preparation and Evaluation Laboratory. All components of the Laboratory must be commercial systems with a previous performance record. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for systems that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

<DESC><p><strong>Required Features<br /></strong>&bull; Must use a standard protocol (Cisco Compatible Extensions) CCX version 1.0 for tags<br />&bull; Must beacons using the standard 802.11<br /><strong>Desired Features<br /></strong>&bull; Tags have led's to show when they are beaconing or being acted upon by a chokepoint - very nice feature<br />&bull; Tags have push buttons to force them to beacon or send messages (these can store up to 15 messages that can be fired by push button or chokepoint).<br />&bull; Tags have replaceable batteries<br />&bull; Tags have mounting tabs<br />&bull; Tags have tamper proof capabilities<br />&bull; Tags have motion, temperature sensors.<br />&bull; Tags are very flexible with regards to their configuration (adjustable beacon rate, channel, power level).<br />&bull; Tags support Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) technology using ISO 24730-standard.<br />&bull; Tags come in various different sizes/form-factor</p>
<p><strong>Use Case Scenarios</strong><br />Following are both a standard set of scenarios describing how we envision RFID tags to be used followed by examples of special cases where we might want to use RFID tags.</p>
<p><strong>Required</strong></p>
<p>1. Affix a low cost tag either internally or externally to a low dollar asset that simply beacons on a regular interval.<br />2. Affix tag externally to personal portable property (i.e. microscope) to beacon both on a fixed schedule and to beacon more frequently when in motion to allow continuous tracking both indoors and outdoors.<br />3. Affix tag internally to a personal portable property (i.e. gas chromatograph) to beacon both on a fixed schedule and to beacon more frequently when in motion to allow continuous tracking both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Desired</strong></p>
<p>4. Affix a tag to sensitive property that has a tamper resistant feature that causes a notification if the tag is removed from the asset. The tag should beacon both on a fixed schedule and to beacon more frequently when in motion to allow continuous tracking both indoors and outdoors.<br />5. Affix a small form factor tag to small portable property (i.e. Barcode scanners, non-wireless PDA, Cameras) to beacon on a fixed schedule and/or to beacon more frequently when in motion.<br />6. Affix a specialized form factor tag into non-standard equipment (i.e. shotgun) to beacon on a fixed schedule and/or to beacon more frequently when in motion.<br />7. Affix a low cost tag internally to "real property" (i.e. HVAC, chillers, fume hoods) to beacon only on a fixed interval as this property is fixed and never moves and is inventoried only every 10 years.<br />8. Is there a need for temperature sensitive tags?<br />9. Operator Person tracking:<br />a. Tag worn by operator. Cause a tag to beacon when in 3' radius (proximity) of a chokepoint preferably including the name of the chokepoint or a preconfigured message. Location, time, and these supplemental data will be archived for incident review.<br />10. Item tracking for Project Teams<br />a. Tag affixed to a mobile cart and possibly attached ad-hoc to item on the cart and tracked indoor/outdoor to provide chain of custody information in response to sensor information or reasonable cause, logic alerts if the two are separated or either or both move to or through unacceptable locations. <br />b. Tag affixed to loan pool type equipment. Chokepoint causes tag to, upon exit of loan pool area, beacon a predefined number of times and change configuration of the tag to: beacon continuously on movement and on a short interval when at rest. Upon return to the loan pool area, the chokepoint causes the tag to beacon and change the configuration of the tag to beacon on a long interval and on movement.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Assets to Track</strong><br />Examples but not limited to Type of Equipment that would be nice to RFID Tag. Please use the following list as examples of required external/internal/embedded applications.</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought

Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Lumberton, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3854 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3212 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for Five (5) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2009.  The delineated area is:

From exit 22 of I-95 which is the Intersection of I-95 and Fayetteville Rd proceed South on Fayetteville Rd, turn left onto Wintergreen, right onto Corporate Dr., right onto Barker Ten Miles Rd., left onto Fayetteville Rd., right onto Roberts Ave., left onto Elm Street, right onto 5th Street, continuing on 5th Street across exit 17 of I-95 down Caton Rd, turn left onto Glen Cowan Rd., left onto Country Club Rd continuing on Country Club Rd to exit 17 of I-95.  Take I-95 North back to exit 22 which is the place of beginning.

Other applicable requirements include:

On site surfaced parking for 14 employees and public.
Reserved on site surfaced parking for 2 official Government vehicles.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<a href="mailto:trudy.h.james@usace.army.mil">U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC), Waterways Experiment Station (WES)</a>
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for information and preliminary planning only.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS has been tasked to solicit for the Design and Implementation of the Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computational Model Builder (CMB) for Multi-Dimensional Models.  This requirement and resulting contract is for research and development of a cross-platform framework of tools to handle the pre- and post-processing of the numerous discipline-specific ERDC developed models that run on DoD High Performance Computers (HPC).  These models are applied to solve problems in watersheds (both surface water and groundwater), rivers, reservoirs, estuaries, and oceans. Simulations are run on both single-processor desktop computers and, for larger applications, on parallel HPC machines.   For both the desktop and HPC simulations, pre- and post-processing (mesh generation, boundary condition assignment, and visualization) historically were accomplished on the serial desktop computers and within the constraints provided by the 32-bit Windows operating environment.  The CMB is based on problem definition concepts that have been in use for many years in the fluid mechanics and solid mechanics disciplines.  The CMB desktop applications cover the many steps necessary to pass from a conceptual description of a problem to be modeled, through mesh generation, boundary and initial condition assignment, creation of input files for a particular simulation code, and post-processing.  The CMB design delays full mesh generation as long as possible to keep problem sizes manageable, working with 2D edges or 3D shells when tagging for boundary conditions.  From a complete conceptual model, simple meshes can be generated locally or the model can be exported as well as its boundary tags for mesh generation by HPC-based meshing tools.  The CMB will continue to develop by adding more ERDC specific needs, such as: setting up two-dimensional surface water problems from basic geographic information system (GIS) inputs; input files for several ERDC-built simulation models; tailored interface DoD/DoE mesh generators, and direct import and meshing of CAD objects. This work will produce a robust multi-functional conceptual modeling environment that is applicable across domains.<BR><BR>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.   The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this Market Survey.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted.<BR><BR>Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government requirements stated above.  The capability statement shall be in sufficient detail and limited to 10 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm.  No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<BR><BR>Interested Offerors shall respond to this notice no later than 02:00 PM (CST) 07 April 2009. Please submit capability statements to:  Trudy H. James, Contract Specialist, ERDC Contracting Office, 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Bldg. 1003, Vicksburg, MS 39180-6199, or email to:  Trudy.H.James@usace.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) dated March 25, 2009:

The purpose of this RFI is to solicit both federal agency and industry feedback regarding the marketing of environmentally friendly processes, products and ideas. This RFI is to solicit interest from federal agencies, nonprofits and companies to market their concepts and educate attendees at a "Green Expo" fair.  If enough interest is expressed, a Green Expo will be held no sooner than 22 April 2009 at the Marina at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.
 
SCOPE:  This is an invitation to participate in an Earth day event at Keesler AFB.  This announcement serves to solicit businesses, nonprofits and government agencies to showcase ideas and educate consumers at a Green Expo.  With the audience anticipated, the strategy arrived at needs to allow for the broadest scope of earth friendly education in order to afford all attendees an opportunity to benefit from ideas exhibited during the Expo. This will be an opportunity for businesses, nonprofits and government agencies to showcase ideas and educate consumers.  The purpose is to provide information on environmentally friendly products or processes for everyday living.  Exhibitors must show how their agency, process or product lessens our impact on the environment or directly helps the environment.  

DETAILS: The Earth Day Green Expo will be held at the Marina at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.  The Green Expo will be held on Wednesday, April 22, 2009.  It will start at 8am and end at 1pm.  This Green Expo will be open to the 200-300 invited local schoolchildren, plus the base populace and government entities in the Biloxi area. The number of participants will be limited and space will be assigned on a first-come/first-served basis.  

 GREEN EXPO OBJECTIVES:  The first objective of this Green Expo is to inform attendees of the many ways they can be more environmentally friendly at home, and at work/school. The second objective of this Green Expo is to afford attendees an opportunity to find ways to incorporate the leading-edge government and commercial technology ideas outlined below:

1. The U.S. Department of Energy has a goal to create the technology
and knowledge base for cost-effective zero-energy buildings by 2025. 
 
2.  Department of Defense energy goals are much more stringent than the goals identified under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Executive Order 13423, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  Department of Defense Goals:  3% energy reduction per year for a total of 30% (gas & electric) by 2015, water reduction of 2% per year for a total of 16% by 2015, and a 25% renewable goal by 2025.  

Exhibitors shall note that no sales of any kind will be made at the Green Expo. Each company, nonprofit and government agency is merely passing on earth-friendly tips and educational information about green products and processes to Expo Visitors.  Any costs incurred by the exhibitor will be the responsibility of the exhibitor and/or the exhibitor's represented company.  Government reimbursement will not be made for any exhibitor's costs.
 
Exhibitors participating need to identify/submit the following to Marcella Whitfield via fax or email before April 14, 2009:

1.  Exhibitors interested in participating must fill out the Entry Authorization Letter (EAL) attached to this RFI with all individuals they would like to attend and the pertinent information required.  

2.  Exhibitors must fill out the attached Green Expo Acceptance Form completely.

<DESC>FCRP Research Announcement
Solicitation 2009- S200902, Due 5/29/09
Point of Contact:
Betsy Weitzman, Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation, SRC
1101 Slater Road, Suite 120, Durham, NC  27703
Email: fcrp-2009-solicitation@src.org

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is assisting the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO) in publishing its research requirements, the purpose of which is to obtain the widest dissemination of the requirements.  The following information is for those wishing to respond to MARCOs solicitation entitled FCRP Research Announcement, Solicitation 2009-S200902, FOCUS CENTERS FOR RESEARCH IN MICROELECTRONICS AND SYSTEMS.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:
The Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO) is soliciting Focus Center proposals for multi-university teams in selected areas of research expertise at United States Institutions of Higher Education.  The Focus Centers will concentrate research attention and resources on ground-breaking research to provide radical innovation in semiconductor technology that provides solutions to barriers in the path of sustaining the historical productivity growth and performance enhancement of semiconductor integrated circuits.  The overall goal of this collaborative effort between the Department of Defense and industry is to sustain the unprecedented multi-decade record of uninterrupted performance improvement in information processing power and storage.  This steady advance in capability resulted from research and development efforts on the part of both military and industrial sectors.  It has provided the Department of Defense with an unmatched technological edge in advanced weaponry and provided the U.S. economy with the productivity enhancements critical to U.S. economic growth.  

MARCO, a subsidiary of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), is a not-for-profit organization that administers the Focus Center Research Program (FCRP) for its participants and other contributors.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is participating in this program.  Cost sharing from universities or other sources is strongly encouraged.  The Program participants will evaluate all proposals submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Research Announcement and the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet. (http://fcrp.src.org/funding/pamphlet_09.pdf) 

The Focus Center Research Program will address major challenges in semiconductor and systems technology on long-range innovative research.  Only U.S. Institutions of Higher Education or research institutions associated with those institutions will be considered for funding.  Proposals may include other organizations, but those other organizations must be funded by some other means; they cannot receive funding for activities through the proposed Focus Center.  Research funded under the FCRP is generally very high risk, high-payback, long-term and targeted to high performance, cost-effective integrated circuit (IC) technology and multi-scale systems research.

MARCO seeks proposals in the following six focus areas:
1.	Nanoelectronic Materials and Processes:  To discover, explore, and identify development pathways for revolutionary nanomaterial design, synthesis, and assembly technologies that enable information processing and storage systems with enhanced functionality and performance.
2.	Structures and Devices: To discover structures and devices that extend CMOS scaling, enhance circuit functionality, and extend options for functional diversification and performance enhancements through heterogeneous device integration.
3.	Connectivity: To discover new interconnect, heat management, and system integration technologies including emerging heterogeneous devices.
4.	Circuits & Modules: To demonstrate the circuit-level topologies and design methodologies that yield functional designs for extremely-scaled CMOS that comprehend the inclusion of novel device and interconnect technologies.
5.	Information Systems Platform Design: To manage system design complexity, improve designer productivity, and develop disruptive design technologies for heterogeneous information processing technologies.
6.	Multi-Scale Systems: To discover and enable optimal application architectures for complex systems operating in many temporal and spatial dimensions. 
Each of these areas is of equal technical importance for proposal purposes.  Offerors may propose innovative research in one or more areas.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the RA 2009-S200902 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced above.

PROGRAM SCOPE:
Up to six full Center awards could be made in the six focus areas identified above.  Following proposal selection, the research agreements will be made as appropriate, for base periods of up to three years and with the research expected to start in November 2009.  Overall program funding may reach a level of $50M per annum, depending on research progress and availability of funds.  The funds may not be equally divided among all the Centers.  The option for three-year renewals exists, dependent on the overall success of the program, the technical progress of the Centers, and the availability of funds.  The technical POC for this effort is Betsy Weitzman (MARCO, email: fcrp-2009-solicitation@src.org).

GENERAL INFORMATION:
Proposers should review the document entitled Proposer Information Pamphlet In Support of FCRP Research Announcement Solicitation 2009-S200902, which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluations, funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet, of which the initial version is attached to this FedBizOpps notice, may be obtained from http://fcrp.src.org/funding/pamphlet_09.pdf or by electronic mail (fcrp-2009-solicitation@src.org) or U.S. mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  All subsequent amendments to the Proposer Information Pamphlet will not be made available on FedBizOpps.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original, six (6) copies and an electronic file in Word or pdf (CD or USB drive) of the proposal to:   

Ms. Betsy Weitzman
Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation, SRC 
1101 Slater Road, Suite 120, 
Durham, NC  27703 

Proposals must be received by Friday, May 29, 2009, in order to be considered.  
This notice, in conjunction with the RA 2009-S200902 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total Research Announcement.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  MARCO reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the FCRP needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by MARCO.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals ; however, no portion of this RA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in the FCRP.

Any objections to the terms of this Research Announcement or the RA 2009-S200902 Proposer Information Pamphlet must be presented in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days of the online publication of this RA.  Any objections to the conduct of receipt, evaluation or award of contract from MARCO must be presented in writing within the (10) calendar days of the date the objector knows or should have known the basis for its objection.  Objections must be provided in letter format, clearly stating that it is an objection or protest to this RA or to the conduct of evaluation or award of a contract, and providing a clearly detailed factual statement of the basis for objection.  Objections must be received at the address stated above for delivery of proposals within the times indicated in order to be considered.  Other administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this RA, should be directed to: fcrp-2009-solicitation@src.org.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:
1.	Overall scientific and technical merit
2.	Ingenuity, novelty, and impact of overall center and new frontier projects
3.	Impact of proposed research (potential contributions to the missions of the FCRP sponsors)
4.	Capabilities of proposed investigators
5.	Cost effectiveness, realism

Cost realism will only be significant for proposals that have seriously over- or under-estimated the cost to complete.  The proposal evaluation and selection process will be carried out by MARCO with the assistance of the FCRP sponsors.

<DESC>REFERENCE IS MADE TO ADVANCED PLANNING BRIEF TO INDUSTRY (APBI) FOR THE CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION EARLY WARNING STRATEGY (CBDEWS) HELD ON FEBRUARY 19, 2009.<BR>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS PERTAINING TO THE APBI ARE HEREBY POSTED BELOW.<BR><BR>-Q -1. Who are the Point of Contacts for the Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) contract vehicle? ANSWER - The AMCOM Express vehicle will no longer be pursued for Phase I.  Instead, we will use Government Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 871-4 Test and Evaluation for Phase I.    The Request for Proposal (RFQ)-Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released on the GSA e-Buy site by 27 March 09 with a planned award by 30 April 2009. <BR>https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov <BR><BR>-Q - 2. Which domain on the AMCOM Express will the Task Order be released under?  Programmatic, Technical, Logistics? ANSWER - See answer to number 1. <BR><BR>-Q - 3. Is the AMCOM Express IDIQ task order contract only being used for Phase I?  Is Phase II a direct bid to Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC)Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO)? <BR>ANSWER -   The AMCOM Express contract will no longer be utilized.  The GSA Schedule will be used for Phase I.   Phase II will be awarded through the Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Edgewood Contracting Center.<BR><BR>-Q - 4. Is the AMCOM announcement also the opportunity to respond if we desire to use the demonstration as a data collection opportunity?  If not, what is the mechanism?  ANSWER - See Answer number 1 above.   A separate Request for Information (RFI) will be released from the RDECOM Edgewood Contracting Center on FedBizOpps.  The RFI will ask prospective participants to describe the data collection they plan to achieve and the JPM NBC CA team will select participants.  Participation may be subject to space limitations on the test grid.<BR><BR>-Q- 5. What is the relationship between Johns Hopkins and the Phase I contractor(s)? ANSWER -   There is no relationship between the work that Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is doing in support of the Chemical Biological Detection Early Warning Strategy (CBDEWS) Operational Demonstration and the systems that the Phase I contractors are able to bring and demonstrate in July at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  Both the JHU and Phase I activities will feed the CBDEWS requirements documentation and planning for Phase II and Phase III implementation.  <BR><BR>-Q  6. How many vendors will have Phase I awards?  The charts suggest multiple.  When will the awards be made? ANSWER -    The JPM NBC CA plans to award contracts to 2  4 vendors for the Phase I effort.  Awards are planned for on or about 30 April 2009.<BR><BR>-Q  7. Why are multiple vendors being considered for Phase II?  It appears that there are solutions that are close&.why spend the funding? ANSWER -   In accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 (2 December 2008), programs are required to provide for two or more competing teams producing prototypes of the system and/or key system elements prior to, or through, Milestone B.  This requirement reduces technical risk, validates designs and cost estimates, allows for evaluation of manufacturing processes and refinement of requirements.  <BR><BR>-Q  8. Are there any organizational conflict of interest concerns/issues regarding contractors supporting system engineering and system development?  ANSWER - The JPM NBC CA has responsibility for end-to-end mission success.   Contract support for System Engineering will be limited to technical expertise in the appropriate areas.  The JPM NBC CA does not foresee OCI issues.  Appropriate firewalls can be emplaced, when and where applicable.<BR><BR>-Q  9. Are you considering acquisition of system-of-system (SoS) Systems Engineering (SE) contractor with responsibility for end-to-end system/mission closure (success)?  If so, is organizational conflict of interest an issue?  Can it be the same contractor with appropriate firewalls?  ANSWER - See answer to number 8. <BR>The integrating (SoS) contractor will be responsible for:<BR>Developing/enhancing the framework for integrating data from disparate sensors <BR>Developing algorithms to fuse the disparate sensor data to provide a better overall detection<BR>System Engineering functions associated with these efforts  <BR><BR>-Q  10. Are Phase II contractors precluded from competing for Phase III? (since proprietary sensor data will need to be utilized in Phase II) ANSWER -   No.  Vendors can participate in all three phases.  The Government will select the best candidates for each phase.  <BR><BR>-Q  11. Are there any concerns for a firm that wants to pursue Phase II and Phase III?  ANSWER - There are no restrictions - vendors may participate in all three phases, as appropriate. <BR><BR>-Q  12. Will sensor providers be precluded from bidding on Phase II Fusion IDIQ contract? ANSWER -   No.  Vendors may participate in all three phases. <BR><BR>-Q  13. Are proposers encouraged to participate in all 3 phases?  ANSWER - Yes.<BR><BR>-Q  14. Why an RFI for Phase I?  Why not just a Request for Proposal/Task Order? ANSWER -   For each phase, the JPM NBC CA is using the best contract mechanism available to provide opportunities to multiple vendors and achieve a timely contract award within the timeframe necessary to accomplish program goals. <BR>In accordance with (IAW) the change in strategy outlined in the answer to question number 1, the Government will solicit a RFQ/RFP from vendors on GSA schedule 871-4 to achieve a quick-turn around for integrated system testing in July 2009.<BR>A separate RFI may be released to permit additional vendors to participate at their own expense. <BR><BR>-Q  15. There are many systems that are currently fielded in DoD that could benefit CBDEWS.  What specific processes will be used in Phase I and Phase II awards to take advantage of fielded systems to minimize risk and save costs?  ANSWER - The JPM NBC CA is aware of fielded Chemical Biological (CB) sensors and fielded Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors that could be beneficial to the CBDEWS mission.   The Phase I effort is intended to demonstrate what can be accomplished with existing systems/assets in the July 2009 demonstration.  Proposals will be judged based on understanding of the CBDEWS effort and the ability to use existing system/assets in time for demonstration in July 2009.    Phase II proposals will be evaluated on the offerors understanding of CBDEWS and how to develop a best value capability to accomplish the mission.  The Government intends to use/modify fielded systems that result in an accelerated schedule, reduced cost, and possible higher performance.   <BR><BR>-Q  16. Will there only be a single vendor that goes beyond Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in Phase II to Critical Design Review (CDR), Milestone C & Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)?  ANSWER - Based on current projection of funds and level of effort, JPM NBC CA presently intends to take only one Phase II design beyond PDR to CDR, Milestone C and LRIP.   Additional competition beyond PDR may be required only if the PDR Assessment could not distinguish a clearly superior solution set and would possibly only be pursued if funding and schedule permits. <BR><BR>-Q  17.  How many Phase II awards?  Why not select one or two from summer demo to max funding to Phase II contractors.  ANSWER - The Phase I demonstration in July 2009 is not a selection criteria for the Phase II efforts. Phase I is intended to provide an analysis on the state of the art.  Contractors will perform limited integration and demonstration to provide data for the analysis.  Contractors will collect and analyze their data and provide the JPM NBC CA a final report on their efforts.  The final report will include recommended techniques for integrating and fusing data and sensor/technology recommendations that, in the contractors view, provides the best solution set.  In addition, the final report will identify information/resource gaps that must be addressed in the EMD program.  Data will be used by the JPM NBC CA to enhance requirements for fusion and sensor systems.  <BR><BR>The present plan is to award a minimum of two (2) contracts under Phase II with the possibility of additional contracts if proposals and funding support that decision.  <BR><BR>-Q  18. Will there be a draft RFP for Phase II?  If not, why?  ANSWER -   Release of a draft RFP is not planned at this time.<BR><BR>-Q  19.  Is Phase III procurement seems to be for an integrator to deliver a complete CBDEWS system or multiple awards for components of the complete system? ANSWER -   The Phase III procurement will consist of multiple awards for sensor components that will feed back into the Phase II integration and fusion efforts.  <BR><BR>-Q  20. Is Phase III procurement award expected to be to one contractor for multiple sensor products or multiples awards for single sensor products?  ANSWER - Phase III may consist of multiple awards for single sensor products.<BR><BR>-Q  21. Clarify the phase 2 & 3 contracts. ANSWER - The Phase II contract is intended to develop the sensor integration and data fusion framework for the CBDEWS program.  The Phase II contract is scheduled for award in the November 2009 timeframe.  Phase III will consist of multiple contracts to develop and/or procure sensors.  Each contract will require the contractors to work together to integrate sensors from Phase III into the Phase II fusion.<BR><BR>-Q  22. Can you cross-walk how the phases fit into the integrated program structure on the Integrated Program Structure chart? ANSWER -   All phases described at the APBI support the Next Generation Chemical Standoff Detection (NGCSD) program.  Phase I supports the July 2009 demonstration by permitting   integration and fusion vendor participation and collecting data for decision analysis.  Phase II and III supports the NGCSD through the Preliminary Design Review in FY10 with options for EMD, LRIP, and Production.  The Phase II contract is intended to develop sensor integration and data fusion framework for the CBDEWS program.  Phase III will consist of multiple contracts to develop and/or procure sensors.  <BR><BR>-Q  23. On the IPS chart  its difficult to determine which PDRs & CDRs go to which phase. ANSWER -    Phases I, II, and III all support the NGCSD effort.  On the chart, the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR) depicted in FY10 are in support of the NGCSD EMD effort.  <BR><BR>The PDR and CDR shown for FY12 and FY13 respectively are for the Chemical Biological Active Standoff System (CBASS) EMD effort.<BR><BR>-Q  24. Will you explain the interdependence of the different phases?  It seems as though Phase III is not related to Phases I & II.  ANSWER -  <BR>Phase I: Vendor participation in July 2009 demonstration will consist of gathering information to better understand the problem and better define the solution.  Information will be used to help write performance specifications. <BR>Phase II: An EMD contract will be awarded for sensor data integration and fusion/algorithm development effort.  This is NOT a contract for a lead system integrator (LSI).<BR>Phase III:  Multiple contracts will be awarded for mature developmental or off-the-shelf sensors to integrate into CBDEWS program and the fusion efforts.<BR><BR>-Q  25. How do the 3 phases described connect to NGSCD and CBASS?  ANSWER - See answer to number 23 and number 24<BR>Note that contracting efforts for the CBASS program have not been identified at this time.<BR><BR>-Q  26. Slide 21  Is MSB (Apr 10) shown for NGCSD or CBASS or does it cover both? ANSWER -   The NGCSD and CBASS programs have separate Milestone B decisions.  The NGCSD programs Milestone B decision is scheduled for FY10.  The CBASS programs Milestone B decision is scheduled for FY12. <BR><BR>-Q  27. What are the approximate dates for - CBASS RFP and - Phase III sensor demos?  ANSWER -   For planning purposes, the CBASS RFP release date is approximately 2QFY11.  However, the CBASS program does not have a capability document nor does it have a commitment from the user community to write a capability document at this time.  Information and data gathered during the NGCSD program will be used to help define the CBASS program.  The Phase III supports the NGCSD program and will consist of awards for sensors (developmental or off-the-shelf) to integrate into Phase II work.  Phase III sensor demonstrations will occur throughout FY10.<BR><BR><BR>-Q  28. Please provide complete technical and program details for any CBDEWS efforts funded to date. (i.e., JHU-APL). ANSWER -    Complete technical information from JHU-Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) efforts will only be provided to the Phase II and Phase III vendors for reference.  A final report will be published in the near future to provide releasable details. <BR><BR>-Q  29. How does industry access applicable work funded @ FFRDC/Gov Labs/University Labs? ANSWER -   See answer number 28<BR><BR>-Q  30. Will Initial Capability Documents (ICDs) be provided (CCSI, IUBIP)?  ANSWER -    The ICDs, draft Performance Specification, and/or the draft CDD will be provided with the RFPs for Phase II and III.<BR><BR>-Q  - 31. What are the required sensitivity for detection and identification of effluents?  ANSWER - Required sensitivity for detection and identification will be provided in the draft performance specification.<BR><BR>-Q  32. Since the fusion performance is a function of the sensors, how soon will sensors be provided to the Phase II vendors? ANSWER -    The Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) delivery schedule will be published in the Phase II RFP for known sensors.  JPM NBC CA expects to provide the first GFE sensor within 30 days of contract award.  <BR>The Phase II contractor will also be required to integrate other sensors identified or developed in Phase III.   Initial integration efforts will be based on mutually developed ICDs.  <BR><BR>-Q  33. Will you utilize the sensors in their current stand alone configuration, or are you expecting to modify the sensors and use fusion to optimize the overall system of systems performance? ANSWER -   Utilizing the sensor in the current stand alone configurations verses in a modified configuration depends on the information provided by the sensor and its place in its life cycle.  Where practical, the JPM NBC CA will modify the output of the sensor to improve fusion capabilities. <BR><BR>-Q  34. Are you open to use any new biological agent detectors, other than those already fielded such as Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS)? ANSWER -   JPM NBC CA is the CBDEWS integrator and chemical detection developer.  New biological sensors are the responsibility of the JPM Biological Defense (BD) and should be vetted appropriately.  JPM NBC CA and JPM BD will coordinate on new biological sensor capabilities to support CBDEWS.<BR><BR>-Q  35. Are manual Chemical Biological (CB) detectors being included?  ANSWER - Assume that the term manual means something akin to a M256 kit or M8 paper that requires the soldier to perform an action and interpret the results.  The data from this sensor type will be manually entered within the CBDEWS system.<BR><BR>-Q  36. For visualization, integrated, correlated funded information  are you going to consider Common Operational Picture http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Common+Operational+Picture  (COP) other than JWARN?  Would you consider other battle command or info centric viewers (e.g. CPOF)? ANSWER -   JPM NBC CA does not envision any particular COP to be a component of the CBDEWS system, JPM NBC CA envisions CBDEWS as a service that can be run from multiple COP environments and thus is expected to be COP agnostic.  The appropriate application programming interfaces need to be available to connect the CBDEWS service to multiple COPs.   <BR><BR>-Q  37. Who will administer the green bar Technology Development on the program structure on slide 22?  Where do we learn more about this effort?  Will it involve new standoff sensors? ANSWER -   The Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO) will administer the Technology Development effort associated with CBASS with the goal to provide new standoff sensors. In addition, the JSTO is developing Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) to support CBDEWS fusion and algorithm development.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) will discuss Technology Development efforts at the Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) Advanced Planning Briefing for Industry (APBI) in May 2009.<BR><BR>-Q - 38. Slide 22  what is the near term fielding opportunity (at top of schedule)? ANSWER -    The near term fielding opportunity is focused on a base capability if a solution appears to be mature enough for fielding.  This capability will focus on requirements for specific, high-payoff installations.   Milestone C entrance criteria will be established in the Acquisition Strategy to support this possibility.<BR><BR>-Q  39. What is the mid-FY10 LRIP on the chart?  What is the item(s) being built? ANSWER -   See answer number 38.<BR><BR>-Q  40. Can you tell us more about the immediate fielding opportunities?  What are the specific applications or needs that must be met in the near term?  ANSWER - See answer number 38.<BR><BR>-Q  41. How will the multiple vendors be scored (during Phase I and Phase II) versus the requirements?  Will extra credit be given for exceeding the requirements[U2] ? ANSWER -   Vendors will not be scored during the execution of Phase I.  In Phase II, the Government will evaluate (at a minimum and in no particular order in this response) offerors:<BR>Design approaches and risks in addressing the requirements<BR>Cost<BR>Schedule <BR>Management processes to include software development (capability maturity model, etc)<BR><BR>Threshold and objective requirements will be provided as part of the RFP.  Extra credit will not be given for exceeding the objective requirements in evaluating the offerors proposals but may be used in evaluating trade-space during the preliminary design process after award.<BR><BR>-Q  42. If a firm is not funded for Phase I can the firm go to Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) in summer 09?  ANSWER - The JPM NBC CA will release a RFI inviting firms to participate, on their own funds, during the FY09 Phase I Demonstration.  Vendors will be given the opportunity to demonstrate their systems against Government releases at DPG on a non-interference basis.<BR><BR>-Q  43. How many field collections will be conducted during each phase?  Will the objectives differ for each collection?  ANSWER - JPM NBC CA will sponsor various collection opportunities on a periodic basis with differing goals based on where we are in the program.  With the exception of Phase I, they will not necessarily be connected to the contract phases described at the CBDEWS APBI. <BR>During Phase I, JPM NBC CA will conduct a demonstration primarily to test mature integrated sensor fusion technologies.  The goal is to collect information to enhance our requirements for NGCSD and assist with requirements development for CBASS.  We expect approximately 90 simulant releases.   <BR><BR>-Q  44. Is there a standard list of chemical effluents that will be used during the demonstration? ANSWER -   The JPM NBC CA plans to employ the following simulants during the Phase I demonstration.<BR>Chemical: Triethyl Phosphate (TEP), Acetic Acid (AA), Methyl Salicytate (MES)  Biological: EH (Erwinia Herbicola), BG (Bacillus Globigii)<BR><BR>-Q  45. Any plans to collect data on micro-meteorological conditions which are needed for network algorithms (lower False Alarms)? ANSWER -   Meteorological (MET) sensors are also ISR sensors. We expect to collect MET data for fusion within the CBDEWS system.<BR><BR>-Q  46. What provisions and requirements are being considered to have operators involved in Phase I?  Phase II?  ANSWER - Warfighters will operate the JPM NBC CA prototype developed by JHU-APL to provide some level of operational realism and feedback on the system.  <BR>The vendor systems participating in Phase I, whether funded or unfunded, will be operated by representatives of the respective vendor. <BR>In Phase II, JPM NBC CA will conduct operational assessments to gain warfighter feedback and formal early assessments of the capability.   The JPM NBC CA will also conduct independent multi-service operational test in the FY12 timeframe and evaluate the system operated by Warfighters.   <BR><BR>-Q  47. Will a data feed from the Chem Raven be available to vendors at the 09 demo?  Can we get the interface information now or soon?  ANSWER - Phase I vendors are not expected to integrate the Chem Raven capability at this time.<BR><BR>-Q  48.  How do we get access to data from Johns Hopkins testing? ANSWER -    See answer number 28.<BR><BR>-Q  49. Is past field collection data available to sensor fusion contractors? ANSWER -   See answer number 28.  Referee data will be provided to sensor fusion contractors after award.  Data from other vendors will not be released.<BR><BR>-Q  50. What companies were involved in the Tech Demo?

<DESC>Procurement action being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

The U.S. Coast Guard intends to award a sole source purchase order to modify two (2) existing Jet Docks and reconfigure each from a 7-cube wide to a 9-cube wide configuration at USCG Sector Guam.

Because the existing installed systems are proprietary and covered by U.S. Patents, there is no source of supply other than Jet Dock, Inc. from which parts can be obtained to convert the 7-cube wide systems currently utilized by field units, to the wider and safer 9-cube wide configuration.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter (SF330) that demonstrates the firms ability to provide an equivalent service as described above. Interested parties must provide rationale, including pricing, as to why they should be considered. All interested firms must respond no later than 15 days from the date of publication of this notice to Kristina Meabon at Kristina.M.Meabon@uscg.mil.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. USCG FD&CC-PAC will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.

<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking sources for the purpose of providing satellite tracking capability of truck shipments of sensitive conventional Arms, Ammunition, Explosives (AA&E) shipments, and Other Sensitive Material (OSM) for Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS), located at Scott Air Force Base IL, Ft Eustis VA, and Norfolk VA.  The satellite tracking service provider must be certified IAW SDDC Freight Traffic Rules Publication No. 1C-R (MFTRP NO. 1C-R) Section 47 (Attachment 1 to this RFI) prior to the start of this requirement 1 July 2009.  The satellite tracking service provider shall provide vehicle position reporting required by the Department of Defense (DOD) for commercial motor transporting of  AA&E shipments, and OSM.  The primary mission of DTTS is to provide safety, security, and in-transit visibility of all DoD AA&E and OSM shipments by hourly pushing its database to USTRANSCOMs Global Transportation Network (GTN) and Intelligent Road & Rail Information server (IRRIS).  Each Carriers truck is required to provide fifteen minute (four positions reports/hourly) vehicle position reports and status messages to commercial carriers dispatch centers employing the global satellite tracking technology.  Each Carriers truck is equipped with a single stroke panic button, which enables driver to provide near real time notification of emergencies or critical situations.  Drivers are required to advise DTTS of any changes of shipment status en route via coded satellite messages.  In accordance with the Military Freight Traffic Rules publication (MFTPR) 1c, the satellite tracking service provider shall electronically forward a copy of all fifteen minute position reports to DTTS when a carriers vehicle is actively transporting a DOD AA&E shipment.  In the event of an in-transit incident (i.e. vehicle hijacking), emergency situations, or other special monitoring situations the satellite tracking service provider shall permit DTTS to remotely reprogram the vehicle self positioning capability by increasing reporting to a value less than the standard fifteen minutes for vehicles identified.  DTTS will also conduct periodic testing of the remote self-positioning feature by randomly selecting vehicles monthly.  Testing will not exceed one hour per vehicle under test.  When a driver or crew member of a carriers truck enables the panic button the contractor will ensure the carrier dispatch and DTTS receives the panic button notification within two minutes or less.  The satellite tracking service provider shall have the capability to recover from a disaster occurrence within three hours in a fully operational capacity.  The base period of performance is 1 July 2009 through 30 September 2009, with a five option periods:
 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2010
1 October 2010 through 30 September 2011
1 October 2011 through 30 September 2012
1 October 2012 through 30 September 2013
1 October 2013 through 30 June 2014
NOTICES:  THIS IS A SERVICE ONLY REQUIREMENT; THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR EQUIPMENT OR THE INSTALLATION OF SAID EQUIPMENT.  DTTS CERTIFICATION IS REQUIRED BEFORE THE START OF PERFORMANCE (1JULY 2009) IAW SDDC FREIGHT TRAFFIC RULES PUBLICATION NO. 1C-R (MFTRP NO. 1C-R).

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

NATIONAL INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER (NIFC)NIFC ON-CALL SECURITY GUARD SERVICESSTATEMENT OF WORK
GENERAL INFORMATION
Introduction
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho, is the Nations support center for wildland firefighting.  Currently, seven Federal and State agencies are co-located within NIFC to coordinate and support wildland fire and disaster operations.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers the NIFC facility, which consists of twenty-three (23) buildings on seventy-three (73) acres including aircraft ramp, taxiways, and storage.
Scope
The BLM at NIFC requires contractor support to provide on-call (24/7) contract security guard services for the site. 
Description of Work
Primary duties of the on-call contract security guard include entry control, alarm monitor duties, CCTV operation, and assisting visitors and employees as needed.  Detailed duty performance instructions will be provided through written guidance (NIFC Security Standard Operating Procedures) and on-site training. During the dayshift (0600-1400) and the swing shift (1400-2200) there will be a federal security guard on-duty who will be posted as the NIFC patrol and will be available for assistance and guidance  to the on-call security guard. During the midnight shift (2200-0600) the on-call security guard will be working alone.
	Entry control duties consist of checking employee identification and allowing entry, checking visitor identification, issuing visitor passes, completing visitor logs, issuing vehicle passes, and being observant for suspicious activity and persons. The on-call security guard will contact the sponsor/sponsoring agency for entry authority of unannounced visitors.
	Alarm monitor duties:
o	Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (PIDS)&#61607;	The PIDS display is a Windows based environment&#61607;	The guard will immediately acknowledge alarms, make an immediate assessment using the CCTV camera system or by dispatching the NIFC patrol (if available), and will clear the alarm from the system to include a written explanation and the guards initials.
o	Reception duress alarm&#61607;	A wall mounted visual and audible alert triggered by/from the Headquarters receptionist.&#61607;	The guard will assess the situation using the CCTV camera system, call the receptionist for information, brief and dispatch the NIFC patrol for further follow-up.
o	911 call Proctor&#61607;	All 911 calls initiated at NIFC are displayed by location and calling number on the 911 Proctor alarm.&#61607;	The guard will telephone the extension displayed and ascertain the nature of the emergency, dispatch the NIFC Patrol, and assist first responders with directions as needed. The guard will immediately contact Ada County Dispatch and advise no emergency in the event of accidental 911 calls.  NIFC Patrol will be dispatched to all 911 calls to include accidental calls.
o	Fire monitoring systems&#61607;	NIFC Security receives calls from Fire Alarm Monitoring Company on the security cell phone.&#61607;	NIFC Patrol and Maintenance personnel will be contacted and briefed on the details of the call. After hours the Chief of Maintenance will be called and briefed on the call details.
	CCTV Operation duties&#61607;	NIFC has a DvTel multiple camera surveillance system comprised of fixed focus and pan, tilt, zoom cameras.&#61607;	The guard will use the system (especially on the midnight shift) to generally maintain site surveillance and as a primary tool to assess perimeter alarms.
	On-call contract guards will normally work in a heated/air conditioned guard station.  However, during emergencies situations or increased threat levels contract security guards may be assigned other posts as determined by and at the discretion of the NIFC Security Manager. NIFC patrol will provide breaks during the day and swing shifts. During midnight shifts the on-call security guard will secure the guard station and use site facilities for bathroom breaks.
	On-call contract security guards must be available at times of short notice (24 hours a day and 7 days per week). A company point of contact must be available 24/7 and be able to fill a contract security guard request within 2 hours of being called.
	On-call contract security guard shift length will usually be 8 hours, but can be as short as 2 hours, or can be extended past 8 hours and into multiple shifts if need be.
	On-call contract security guards will be well groomed and in a neat and clean uniform.  The uniform must clearly identify the contract guard as representing the security service company.  ** Note that no weapons are permitted on NIFC with the exception of credentialed law enforcement personnel.
	On-call security guards will account for NIFC provided equipment at each shift change and once on duty will not leave the site until properly relieved of duty by the on-coming shift.
	On-call contract security guards will have at a minimum 40 hours of basic security training that includes communication skills, basic windows based computer skills, recognizing and reporting suspicious activities, and critical decision making.  This training will be provided by the security contract company.
	NIFC site specific training will be provided by NIFC Security personnel. The contract security company shall make the prospective on-call security guard(s) available for an 8 hour training session prior to being assigned a shift a NIFC.  Training will generally be available Mon-Fri from 1400 hours to 2200 hours with prior coordination with the NIFC Security Manager. Guard compensation for the 8 hour training session will be the contractors responsibility and these training hours will not be billable to NIFC as on-call security guard hours of service.
	The contractor will comply with the Contractor Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements as attached.

<CONTACT>Shirley Campbell, Business Operations Specialist, Phone 202-283-1338, Fax 202-283-1290, Email shirley.a.campbell@irs.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-00079, provisions and clauses are in effect through FAC 2005-29 Amendment 1 and incorporated into this RFQ.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423430.  

This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure Citrix Systems, Inc., Metaframe Presentation Server-Enterprise Edition (SUBHUDOPNEESAR) software annual maintenance. The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand name but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent. 

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement: Citrix Systems, Inc., Metaframe Presentation Server-Enterprise Edition (SUBHUDOPNEESAR) software annual maintenance.  The rationale is that this requirement is for the maintenance of mission critical Integrated Financial System (IFS).  The Citrix software provides secure access through the firewalls to the IFS application.  The components must be fully functional for the project to provide the designed functionality.  IFS is a powerful management tool that will help better budget, plan, track, report, and manage its finances. Its designed to input, track, and report financial data.  IFS processes applications for General Ledger, Cost Accounting, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Budgeting Formulation, Budget Execution, and Financial and Ad Hoc Reporting. 

The Citrix Systems, Inc., Metaframe Presentation Server-Enterprise Edition (SUBHUDOPNEESAR) software is already installed and operating in the IRS environment as described above. It would be too costly to procure new software, install and test the software, and have it operational to support daily workloads. 

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-27 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors - Commercial, and FAR 212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition. Offerors shall include a fully executed copy of FAR provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with their offer.

<DESC><p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisitions Regulation Part 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation issued as Reference DG1352-09-RQ0931(GJB). This solicitation document incorporates Statement of Work, provisions and clauses. The provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30. NAICS number is 541511 Small Business Size Standard $25.0. The Government intent to award a Firm Fixed Price order.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplier Diversity Database</p>
<p>I. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Currently, the MBDA Phoenix Opportunity application has a data base of minority businesses and provides complete and comprehensive profiles on minority business enterprises (MBE's). This information is sometimes used to track and facilitate singular or collaborative client communication with respect to business to business linkages.</p>
<p>This system is a self certifying system and contains no validation on the information that is entered on a voluntary basis. There are over forty five thousand (45,000) MBE's in this system. This represents just a small fraction of the number of minority firms nationally. Given MBDA's mission to enhance the growth and expansion of minority business enterprises, it is imperative that outreach be to the vast majority of the MBE's.</p>
<p>MBDA funds approximately 45 centers nationally. Please visit www.mbda.gov for a detailed listing and additional information. The funded centers are operated independently by non-profit, for-profit, tribal entities and state/local governments. MBDA's funded centers are an extension of MBDA. The centers provide a wide range of services for the Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) and support the reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>The funded centers are required; as part of their performance measures; to promote linking Minority Owned business with opportunities, encourage joint ventures, strategic alliances and partnerships there is limited ability for the funded centers, MBDA Headquarters (HQ) and the National Enterprise Centers (NEC) to source for Minority Businesses. Access to the Supplier Locator would give MBDA a method for locating, sharing and storing MBE Data in one comprehensive data base.</p>
<p>Information that is shared through face-to-face meetings, emails and telephony is not readily captured and shared within MBDA's intra-network. No common data repository exists that is viewable and accessible by the stakeholder community. The MBDA Web Portal while accessible to the Centers has limited capabilities and limited information, while the Supplier Locator has information from all local state and federal and corporate supplier registration sites nation wide. The Supplier Locator will allow MBDA to have access to approximately two million Minority Business Profiles. If a funded center's grant is not renewed and their clients still have need for MBDA services, MBDA has no way of finding those clients for future opportunities; with the Supplier Locator those clients would be available to MBDA as long as they have been registered in any of the systems that links with.</p>
<p>MBDA's current method of collecting Minority Business profiles is depended on the Web Portal and Performance Reporting System. The systems are not user friendly or intuitive and do not meet the reporting needs of the diverse user community. Anomalies were also introduced.</p>
<p>Having access to the Supplier Locator with business profiles would:</p>
<p>1. Improve organizational efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness within the MBDA intra-network.</p>
<p>2. Increase customer satisfaction scores.</p>
<p>3. Promote Minority business for business linkages, joint ventures, strategic alliances and partnering relationships.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE</p>
<p>MBDA seeks to purchase and implement access to a Supplier diversity data base that far exceeds the number of firms currently in our systems and is the best in class with respect to the related technology. The database should contain information on firms both nationally and globally.</p>
<p>The solution should be hosted and serve as software as a service minimizing the resources required by MBDA. This out of the box web based solution should provide reporting and customization with up to date information/data. It should support a minimum of 30 users nationally. The data will be used to meet the mission and goals of MBDA.</p>
<p>III. DETAIL OF SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The Supplier Locator solution must support approximately 75 MBDA users at Headquarters and the five National Enterprise Centers. The Supplier Locator system must be accessed via a secured internet website. Upgrades to the database should be done as a continuous process and must not require any resources from MBDA. The Supplier Locater must meet Federal Information Security standards and other Federal guidelines listed below. The solution shall support the following capabilities:</p>
<p>Comprehensive Information:<br />&bull; Access to data from local, state, and federal government agencies into one repository.<br />&bull; Access to certified diverse businesses.</p>
<p>Accurate and Real-Time Data Verification:<br />&bull; Access to data that is updated and maintained on a daily basis for real-time verification of supplier status. <br />&bull; Certification information is updated on an aggressive schedule to ensure the latest data is available.</p>
<p>Integration with Supplier Portal:<br />&bull; Capability and/or access as a stand alone sourcing directory or as integrated with the Supplier portal, provided that both are being implemented at the same time.<br />&bull; A merged search capability within the portal.</p>
<p>Training and Support for MBDA staff and access to online helpdesk support.<br /><br />IV. CONSTRAINTS</p>
<p>The solutions developed for this proposal shall conform to, at a minimum:</p>
<p>&bull; DOC applicable policy (DOC Administrative Order 200-0 is the official source for IT policy), most importantly the IT Security Policy; <br />&bull; Standard Operating Procedures and Change Management Policies and Procedures; <br />&bull; Data protection and policy outlined in the Privacy Impact Assessments required by the E-Government Act of 2002; <br />&bull; The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996; <br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994; <br />&bull; The Government Performance and Results Act <br />(G PRA) of 1993; <br />&bull; Applicability with Section 508;</p>
<p>V. DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The Supplier Locator shall provide the following capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull; General Features <br />o A single, cohesive data repository updated in real-time <br />o Workflow automation</p>
<p>&bull; Reporting Features <br />o Standard reports<br />o Ad-hoc and customization of reports</p>
<p>&bull; Integration Features <br />o Ability to import leads from spreadsheets <br />o Microsoft Office and Outlook integration <br />o Leverage marketing databases to insert contact information into documents such as letters or mailing labels</p>
<p>&bull; Accessibility Features <br />o Secure web or remote access options <br />o Role based security and permissions</p>
<p>&bull; Vendor Support <br />o The vendor provides a "train the trainer" program as part of its standard training services. The vendor can train the Client Administrator or personnel designated to administer the system or the program for the Client. The vendor provides four web-based training sessions (up to 2 hours each) for each module, which in our experience has been sufficient to make the vast majority of users/trainers comfortable with the system. Each web session using the vendor web tool can support up to 25 users.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor I - Technical Capability of the proposed item to meet the requireme! nts of the solicitation Factor II - Past Performance Factor III - Price Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor I above, which represents the minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the proposal will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.

In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor I to be technically acceptable, Factor II is significantly less important than Factor III. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

(b) Technical capability will be assessed by evaluating the information submitted in response to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, as amended above.

Items offered, as provided in the offeror's technical proposal, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award (c) Offerors' past performance information submitted, as required by the proposal contents information set fort above, will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance. Offerors should therefore provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to five similar contracts. The Contracting Officer will valuate Past Performance as follows: NEUTRAL: No relevant past performa! nce available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offerors past performance. SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.

BASIS FOR AWARD: 

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach.  Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoters quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoterss technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.  

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): technical capability, past performance, and price. Factor 1 - Technical capability: Quotations will be evaluated on the quoters ability to: 1. Meet the minimum requirements regarding lodging, meeting space, audio visual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service, and the quoters ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility; 2. Provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to those quoters who can provide the required services on the dates listed in the order of preference; 3. Provide a training facility with adequate parking for participants and presenters that is located within the specified postal zip codes. Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for similar work awarded within the past three (3) years. One of the three (3) references must be a federal agency.  The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of federal government agency and or state and local government agency client; 2. Name, title, and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, and telephone number of clients program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. The Government will evaluate past performance of the quoter as it relates to quoters record of performance according to the solicitation, quoters record of controlling cost, quoters adherence to contract schedules and quoters commitment to customer satisfaction. Evaluation of Options: Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Governments best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Factor 3  Price: The Government will evaluate price in comparison to the independent Government cost estimate.  Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoters initial quote should contain the quoters best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The quoter shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. Clause 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government  Alternate I, Clause 52.222-3 Convict Labor, Clause 52.222-19 Child LaborCooperation with Authorities and Remedies, Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities , Clause 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, Clause 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, and Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer  Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

(To be used at the Contracting Officers discretion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) N/A<br />(ii) N/A<br />(iii) N/A<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) N/A<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

Solicitation Number: HSCG38-09-Q-S00058
Agency: Department of Homeland Security
Office: United States Coast Guard (USCG)
Location: Commanding Officer, USCG Aviation Logistics Center
Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for the procurement of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation (HSCG38-09-Q-S00058) incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30. The U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, or to a responsible contractor who can provide a Certificate of Conformance with traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the purchase of the items listed below. The OEM is Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. However, all responsible contractors may submit an offer. To meet the requirements of FAR 11.105 and 5.102(a)(6), the Justification/documentation for purchase of items peculiar to one manufacturer will be made available via a solicitation amendment.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>The proposed action is for requirements which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302, as an Urgent and Compelling action. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received prior to 30 March 2009 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This solicitation VA-261-09-RQ-00160 is issued as an Urgent and Compelling Request for Quote (RFQ).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number is 423450.This Urgent and Compelling requirement closes and is due back to Christine.a.peterson3@va.gov  by 2:00 p.m. Pacific time, 30 March 2009. Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other than Full and Open CompetitionFOR Urgent and Compelling Emergency bridge ContractSubject: VA-261-09-RP-0160/Custom Surgical Packs for VA Facility Medical CentersCONTRACTING AGENCY:  Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 21 Consolidated Contracting Activity (CCA).2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  VISN 21 VA Medical Centers have an urgent and compelling need for the continuation of the production and distribution of their Custom Surgical Packs. Previously this requirement was under contract five separate contracts - utilizing two separate Vendors.  Currently the National Contracting Agency (NAC) is in the process of preparing a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that will provide this requirement for all facilities for the next five years. The NAC has stated that it will likely take two to three months to review all of the sources.  In other words the process will take longer than originally anticipated. Therefore a temporary Bridge Contract is being implemented to provide for these requirements. 3.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: Urgent and Compelling Emergency requirement under FAR 6.302-1 (iii). Custom Surgical Packs are available from the original sources by which they are custom manufactured. Items are required for all of VISN21 Surgical Services. These Custom Surgical Packs are best provided and made available as a follow on contract.  The Custom Packs are produced for each facility to strict specifications and can not be purchased off the shelf. The continuing manufacturing and distribution of the currently produced Custom Surgical Pack would be the most advantageous method for the Government to use. Substantial duplication of cost to the Government would occur and those costs would not be retrieval through any form of open competition. It has been determined that it would take approximately 120 days to produce new Surgical Packs by other sources. This is an unacceptable delay since the Surgical Packs will be required on a daily basis. It was anticipated that the NAC could accomplish the requirement in time but do to unforeseen complications the date was pushed out to April 2009. 4.  DESCRIPTION OF SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS: Vendor is required to provide aforementioned Custom Surgical Packs as described in #3 above.  Estimated value of requirement this requirement for three (3) months is: $393,072.005.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-2 6.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: Would adversely affect patient care in that surgeries could not be performed without the surgical packs. The agency's need for the surgical packs is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Patients would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.7.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: N/A, per #5 above.8.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION: A Price Negotiation Memorandum will be prepared which will detail the actions taken by the Contracting Officer to ensure fair and reasonable pricing.9.  MARKET SURVEY/RESEARCH: N/A10.  OTHER FACTORS:  N/A11.  INTERESTED SOURCES: N/A12.  AGENCY ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: Action to implement a competitive, open market Request for Proposal is already underway.  This will succeed the temporary bridge contract on or about June 1, 2009.13.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:  I hereby determine that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.____________________________________		____________________CHRISTINE A.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561621. The business size standard is $12.5 M. Offutt AFB intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the following items:</p>
<p>Line Item:<br />Monaco D-21G Redundant Fire Reporting System and installation.</p>
<p>Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or</p>
<p>(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>

Offutt AFB utilizes radio frequency transceivers installed in 95% of its facilities to transmit fire, trouble, and supervisory alarms, manufactured by Monaco Enterprises. The proposed system must mirror the existing D-21 system and be compatible with all fire alarm transceivers already installed in base facilities. Monaco Enterprises is the only company that is qualified to produce this item. Monaco Enterprises processes (or manufacture processes) are proprietary.

Monaco Enterprises is the only responsible source with the necessary design, manufacturing, production, and process data capable of providing items that meet the minimum requirements for form, fit, and function. This corporate knowledge can only be provided by Monaco Enterprises. Monaco Enterprises is the only company that can provide system compatibility and solutions to interface with the existing network of Radio Frequency transceivers already in place on Offutt AFB.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0003:  The purpose of this amendment is re-open the solicitationand to increase the quantity of units.  Please provide a quotation/proposal orrevised quotation/proposal for 65-75 units instead of 25 units.  The proposaldue date is hereby extended to 1800 02 April 2009.Amendment 0002- The following amendment is to answer questions andchange two part onmidirectional antenna to two port omnidirectional antenna.The proposal due date and time is not extended.Questions and AnswersQuestion 1. You make reference to the "Antenna" (singular) should operate at200 watts, should be lightweight, etc. You also list top and bottom radiatordimensions not to exceed "36" and "69" respectively. Can you confirm that thesolicitation is for (1) antenna system which employs (2) separately functioningantennas operating in the specified frequency range, with (2) separate antennacabling assemblies, each one feeding the (2) separately functioning antennas?In other words, one antenna assembly with (2) independent antennas coveringthe 30-88 MHz range, one stacked on top of the other one?Answer: The understanding above is one alternative technical solution that willmeet the specifications; however, the Government's requirement is for acommercial two port omnidirectional antenna (singular) mounted in a stackedconfiguration.Question 2.  The reason for clarification is that you have different max sizesforthe top and bottom radiators and refer to the assembly in the singular. If youwant (2) antennas similarly designed, I would presume that the difference inradiator lengths is to limit the overall size?Answer 2:  As stated in Answer 1, the requirement is for one antenna; however,if an alternative proposal is submitted, the overall size limitations remainunchanged.Question 3: Also, are the cable assemblies separate items to be attached atthe antenna with surface mounted receptacles on the antenna, or are the cableassemblies to be an integral part of the antenna? Also, if to plug in, are thecable assemblies meant to plug in on the side of the antenna assembly orplug in at the base on the bottom side of the antenna tube. Please advise ifthere is a preference for design considerations.Answer 3: Either solution identified is technically acceptable; however, thepreference is for surface mounted receptacles on the antenna.Question 4: Is this a replacement for an existing antenna in use and are theredesign drawings available? If not, will the proposed antenna need to gothrough first article testing. If so, is there a schedule for that upon award?Answer 4: Since this antenna is a commercial item, first article testing willnotbe performed and drawings are not available.  This purchase is not areplacement; however, these antennas will augment antennas currently in use.Those antennas are COM 228 by Atlantic Microwave Division Sensor andAntenna Systems (COBHAM).Question 5: Why the specifications list separate SWR and gain figures for eachelement?Answer 5:  The specifications listed match the specifications of the antennaalready in use. See answer 4.Amendment 0001- This amendment is to delete the attachment and includeinformation in the description and change the delivery requirement to 150 daysor sooner.This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented withadditional information included in this notice.

<DESC>Answers to questions submitted.

1.  Do you have any idea of the quantity/ work flow for the project? Should I assume that the work will be based on a forty hour work week?
You should not assume that the work is based on a forty hour work week. The quantity of a project can vary dramatically depending on the location, type of event or activity. Generally for this contract we hire in half-day and full-day increments. We anticipate about two activities per month. On occasion, a photo assignment may last a number of days where hundreds of images are gathered.

Workflow:  Please see section 2.3 of the RFQ. 

2.  In the documentation, it is requested that images meet "Census Bureau requirements and standards". Is there any official documentation that states those requirements?
Please see examples from our current Web archives at: http://www.census.gov/pubinfo/www/broadcast/photos/index.html

3.  Do you know the types of events that will need to be photographed other than the corporate photography?
Although assignments vary, typical photo activities include documentation at news conferences, regional US Census Bureau meetings or operational activities, portrait-style images of stake-holders and US Census Bureau employees, executive staff, etc.

4.  Do you have an idea of how remote some of the locations will be?
Assignments range across the US, including Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska. In general, activities and assignments occur in and around Washington, DC and the areas of the US Census Bureau Regional Offices:

New York, NY
Boston, MA
Philadelphia, PA
Chicago, IL
Atlanta, GA
Charlotte, NC
Dallas, TX
Denver, CO
Los Angeles, CA
Seattle, WA
Kansas City, KS
Detroit, MI

5.  Under (1.) Pricing, what is the annual rate figure if this is a time and materials contract?
Please see the Deliverables section.

6.  Under (1.) Pricing, there is no box for  day pricing; do you need that pricing for my bid as well.
See 6.3. Please provide costs for half-day and full-day rates and any others rates that are relevant services the vendor offers.

7.  Under (2.6) Travel it states there is no travel but in (6.3) Pricing it asks for markups for remote locations.
These activities are expected to involve services performed in areas outside the contractors local area. Subcontracting is anticipated and, where possible, required in major areas of Census Bureau operations and activities. The Census Bureau does not anticipate incurring travel and lodging costs for vendor personnel to accomplish assigned activities. 

8.  In (2.3) Deliverables/Delivery Schedule, it describes the possible need for photo assistants. Will each job dictate different requirements for personnel needed to accomplish the assignment? How do I show this in my pricing?
Each job may, in fact, require different personnel for different jobs. Some of these may require the inclusion of additional personnel such as a photo assistant. Vendor should provide ALL relevant half-day and full-day pricing to accommodate the range of documentary activities listed above.

9. What form will final delivery be:  DVD or FTP upload.
Generally DVD is preferred but access to an FTP site is also acceptable. Task manager will specify per assigned activity. Please see section 2.3.

10. How many actual days of photography work was rendered/performed last year under the previous contract?
The number is irrelevant as requirements increase or decrease per activity and region depending on operational activities, news events, etc. It is anticipated that there will be, on average, two documentary assignments per month.

11.  Was the Government billed on a daily rate or was it the annual figure requested in question number 1?
Billing is on a per-project basis, half-day and full-day rates.

12.  When a job is delivered, does the Task Manager expect to have all images from the shoot ready to use in reproduction or will or would the Task Manager look at a "rough edit" version of the entire shoot and request a handful of images to be processed for reproduction?
Turnaround times vary by assignment and will be directed by the task manager. However, vendor should be prepared to make selections, edit and transfer images in a timely manner, in some cases immediately following an event (as directed by task manager) or same day of assignment.

13. What does a typical shoot consists of? Is it usually event/photojournalist coverage? What type of events, how often do they occur, etc.?
Although assignments vary, typical photo activities include documentation at news conferences, regional US Census Bureau meetings or operational activities, portrait-style images of stake-holders and US Census Bureau employees, executive staff, etc.

14. Clarify what the "Annual Rate" means.
See Deliverables section. The estimated total cost of activities, two-per month, for one year.

15. What would be considered "Proof of Contractors ability to deliver high-quality photographic support within a 24-hour turnaround."
Vendor should provide written statements indicating the operating procedures and policy that ensure timely delivery of images, products, etc.

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Command and Control Engineering Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) applications. Of particular interest are technologies that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that support legacy and new military electronic systems. Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and useability of these new and legacy military electronic systems. Access to Rome Research Site laboratories, including such legacy systems as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Master Caution Panel (MCP), Joint Air &amp; Space Management &amp; Deconfliction (JASMAD), and others, will be provided as necessary. This effort will investigate the application and/or development of emerging and in-use commercial information technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Legacy and evolving Air Force C4I systems: This area covers not only technological upgrades to the existing Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) command and control structure/functions, but also revolutionary concepts for future operations centers, such as the Advanced Technology Air and Space Operations Center (AT-AOC). Examples of the applicable technologies are advanced distributed architectures, publish/subscribe concepts and architectures, distributed computing environments, real-time processing, digital graphics, portable/wearable/mobile computational devices, and advanced displays/user interfaces. (2) Simulation and modeling technologies applicable to Air Force C4I systems: Simulation and modeling for this purpose represent the full range of applications from supporting the development of the individual components within an Air Force C4I system to developing course of action evaluation tools to facilitate the AOC planning function. Examples of these technologies include: model abstraction, multi-resolution modeling, model interoperability, real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, C4I concept evaluations, long haul networked simulations utilizing HLA and other standard protocols, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of rehearsal, dynamic planning/execution, and dynamic battle management. (3) Technology for integration, test, and demonstration of Air Force C4I systems: systems integration and demonstration are used here to represent the spectrum of testing, evaluation, and demonstration that is typically conducted during the development, integration, and fielding phases of an Air Force C4I system and any of its component parts. Examples of these technologies are those that are involved with the integration, measurement, assessment, and demonstration of information, Command and Control, communications, and enterprise systems as they relate to, or are part of, legacy and developing Air Force C4I systems. (4) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems: This area encompasses all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I systems/applications. Examples of these technologies are data retrieval/mining, data storage, software/system monitors, data visualization, data busses, publish/subscribe mechanisms, digital moving maps, and decision making techniques. (5) Development of technology to enhance and enable the use of collaborative environments in AF C4ISR systems and enterprises: This refers to development of individual collaboration tools, as well as the larger collaborative environment which results from networking the individual tools for simultaneous employment with multiple users that are widely dispersed. Examples of these technologies are collaborative engineering and virtual prototyping environments which enable the collaborative development and application of information, air planning, and enterprise technologies/applications.</p>
<p>Additional topic area added 30 April 2008:</p>
<p>The recommended date for white papers for this topic area is by 30 May 2008.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to seek white papers for applying Information Technology to improve Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Division (ISRD) intelligence (INTEL) functions by application of advanced algorithms and software tools for: automated aggregation of multiple foundational INTEL sources (OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, IMINT) and data fusion of INTEL data for the space domain. White Papers are being sought that provide automated indications and warning (I&amp;W) and predictive modeling of adversarial counterspace threats to US space assets (both on-orbit and terrestrial); and automated all-source space INTEL analyst decision support capabilities to help INTEL analysts provide timely and highly accurate space threat assessments. The objective of this modification is to overcome current limited Space Situation Awareness capabilities to detect, identify, anticipate, and assess adversarial counterspace threats to US space assets by rapidly developing software tools and automated techniques to provide timely, accurate, relevant, aggregate, anticipatory threat assessments and confidence levels; this novel capability will enable INTEL analysts to easily and rapidly understand adversarial counterspace intentions and actions in time for effective defensive counterspace actions to be achieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional topic area added 10 July 2008:</p>
<p>Recommended date for white papers for this topic area is 4 September 2008. White papers are being sought that provide automated decision aids for better course of action analysis and selection, dynamic resource management , timely feedback to assess effectiveness of on-going operations and agile C2 enterprise management system approaches to allow more adaptable and resilient operations. Space Superiority can be defined as integrating space situational awareness (SSA) and command and control (C2) in order to more effectively task space control capabilities. Space C2 functions enable commanders to plan, direct, coordinate, synchronize and control operations of assigned forces. Technologies to improve Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) and associated entities planning, execution and assessment capabilities associated with the space tasking cycle starting with commander's intent and ending with combat assessment are needed.</p>

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of Intelligence and analytic support systems.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Community and the Air Force routinely sponsor classified and unclassified research to advance the state of the art in intelligence and analytic support systems. To date, many of these programs have focused on developing systems, tools and algorithms to detect international terrorist activities and planned events of interest. By relying on highly accurate and analyst-vetted knowledge about known terrorists, groups, affiliations, and activities these tools and methods have proven to be very effective at tracking terrorist suspects and detecting their threat event intentions. In total, these programs have resulted in the development and evaluation of several methods of detecting and searching for patterns of terrorist behaviors, representing these behaviors in human and machine interpretable form and efficiently searching large data stores for evidence of known behaviors. Significant effort has been invested in improving the performance and scalability of the most promising algorithms, often resulting in two orders of magnitude increase in scalability and four orders of magnitude speed-up in compute time. However, the total production time for a single answer is currently measured in days and weeks. To have any demonstrable improvement in the intelligence process we need to provide answers in hours or minutes. Several fundamental challenges remain before the technology can be deployed broadly within the Intelligence Community. The four key challenges that define the essence of the Tangram program are:</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce system and data configuration time of all automated entity and threat discovery processes by two orders of magnitude (100 x).<br />&bull; Reduce threat entity and event discovery time by two orders of magnitude (100 x).<br />&bull; Increase overall efficiency by three orders of magnitude and overall productivity by two orders of magnitude over current processes while delivering a consistently high intelligence value as determined by experienced analysts.<br />&bull; Improve the detection of low observable threats and events where guilt by association assumptions may not apply.</p>
<p>The fundamental technologies developed under previous programs have been evaluated through peer review and technical evaluations. There is no debate that these technologies are capable of filling an important void in the Intelligence Community's analytic arsenal. However, to achieve their potential, we must develop the processes, procedures and standards to deploy a fully automated, analytic system capable of processing tens of thousands of simultaneous analytic inquiries in an efficient and scalable manner. To achieve this, the data, algorithms, and computing resources must be flexible and adaptable. Essentially, the system must be self composing because of the variety and unpredictability of the questions to be answered.</p>
<p>Tangram is unique in that it takes a systematic view of the process; applying what is now a set of disjointed technologies that are difficult for non-technical users to apply, cumbersome to configure into a self-configuring, continuously operating system.</p>
<p>Tangram is envisioned as a fully automated, continuously operating, intelligence analysis support system that's capable of configuring itself to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between estimated intelligence value and cost, where:</p>
<p>&bull; Analysis Support means the production of hypotheses representing an adversary's intentions, methods, logistics support or intended targets based on: 1) behavioral patterns, relationships or context that are expressed only in data and, 2) analyst feedback about prior hypotheses.</p>
<p>&bull; Configuring itself means the system is aware of the data characteristics, algorithm capabilities and requirements, and hardware resources such that it can reason how best to produce an answer.</p>
<p>&bull; Reasonable means good is enough, optimal is not required.</p>
<p>&bull; Intelligence Value is a subjective score or estimate of the intelligence utility of a hypotheses produced by the system.</p>
<p>&bull; Cost is the effort required to produce an answer and the opportunity cost of not producing a higher intelligence value product using the same system resources.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following area: 1) Gap Filling Research. Additional details regarding these areas are detailed in the TANGRAM Proposer's Information Packet (PIP) and other documents which can be found at https://extranet.if.afrl.af.mil/programs/TANGRAM/TANGRAM-extra.html. Offerors wishing to propose in more than one area should submit separate white papers and proposals.</p>

Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>5. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send proposals or white papers to the Contracting Officer. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Deborah Cerino, AFRL/RIED, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441. Respondents are required to provide their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA-06-04-IFKA.</p>
<p>Electronic submission to BAA0604@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including understanding the problem, the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, integration approach, and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly intervals, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Cost Realism, Reasonableness, and Project Management Plan - The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort. Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan details the capabilities necessary to effectively manage the team and allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white paper/proposals will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after whitepaper/proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies. Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY. Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VIII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Deborah Cerino<br />Telephone: (315) 330-1445 <br />Email: BAA0604@rl.af.mil<br />Electronic submission preferred</p>

<DESC>If The Government removes the requirement for the capability to measure surface profiles and surface roughness including but not limited to concave and convex sidewalls and 2D shapes such as a portion of the surface of a particle, then the capability to measure forces including lateral force during scans will be of high importance.  

A wide variety of force measurements are of interest and the minimum resolvable force will depend upon the AFM system noise as well as the type of cantilever being used and the medium in which the cantilever is operating.  Therefore, low system noise as measured in one or more ways will be used as a criterion to select among competing hard-mater AFMs.  Suggestions by potential vendors for meaningful system noise specifications are solicited in response to this Amendment to AMD-09-SS21.  Also, information about capabilities from vendors who can meet some but not all of the requirements listed in AMD-09-SS21 is solicited.

<DESC>REFERENCE IS MADE TO ADVANCED PLANNING BRIEF TO INDUSTRY (APBI) FOR THE CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION EARLY WARNING STRATEGY (CBDEWS) HELD ON FEBRUARY 19, 2009.<BR>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 51 - 67 AND LIST OF ATTENDEES PERTAINING TO THE APBI ARE HEREBY POSTED BELOW.<BR><BR>-Q  51. How much money is allocated for Systems Engineering? ANSWER -   Funding data is not releasable.  The Presidential budget is public knowledge and includes funding lines for the NGCSD and CBASS programs. <BR><BR>-Q  52. Has a set of objectives and exit criteria been established for each phase of the program?  ANSWER - No, but will be established.<BR><BR>-Q  53. What is the definition of fusion? ANSWER - Fusion is the aggregation, manipulation, and analysis of data for the purposes of collecting and prioritizing data, directing actions to support further analysis, and providing the information to the Warfighter.  The task will also include the development of interfaces to better facilitate data exchange and analysis.  For example, take sensor A, B, C, put the data together and determine the real detection and threat to soldier.<BR><BR>-Q  54. Will CBASS be an incremental program with continuous updates as technology progresses? ANSWER -    The acquisition strategy for CBASS has not yet been determined.  However, it will align with the new DoD 5000.02 for evolutionary acquisition.<BR><BR>-Q  55. Does CBDEWS Phase III = NGCSD?  ANSWER - CBDEWS is the combined strategy of the NGCSD and CBASS programs as described on slide 22 of the presentation.  NGCSD = Phase II & Phase III of the near-term contracting strategy described on slide 21.<BR><BR>-Q  56. What really is the difference between NGCSD and CBASS?  Is it just bio? ANSWER - The focus of NGCSD is the framework for integrating and fusing sensor data and acquisition of additional mature, high payoff sensor technologies.<BR>The focus of CBASS is development of a CB standoff sensor which can be operated independently or in concert with the NGCSD fusion system.  <BR><BR>-Q  57. How is the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO) aligned to support CBDEWS long term? ANSWER -    See answer number 37.<BR><BR>-Q  58. Is there a formal system integrator for this program? ANSWER -    Per regulation, JPM NBC CA will be the lead system integrator as the owner of the program.  Phase II contractor will develop the sensor data integration and fusion framework and integrate new sensors and systems selected by the Government.  The Phase II contractor may also assist in performing trade studies and analysis, but the Government will make final decisions on trades.  The Statement of Work (SOW) will clearly identify the roll of the JPM NBC CA vs. contractor.  <BR><BR>-Q  59. Do you want a system integration or not?  ANSWER - See answer number 58.<BR><BR>-Q  60. How will sensor developers collaborate with the fusion developers?  How do they work together to set up the sensor geometry? ANSWER -   The JPM NBC CA will ensure that there is language in the contracts for sensor vendors and fusion vendors to work together to include but not limited to the appropriate Non-Disclosure Agreements between collaborating vendors.<BR><BR>-Q  61. Are there available reports or briefings on the Johns Hopkins CBDEWS effort? ANSWER -   See answer number 28. <BR><BR>-Q  62. In order to build the business case, industry really needs to understand that gold at the end of the trail.  What are the production opportunities that are anticipated on this program? ANSWER -   Production opportunities exist for the NGCSD system in the FY12-14 timeframe.  Additional opportunities exist for CBASS in the FY15 and beyond timeframe.  Following an analysis of alternatives, an IPR will be held to discuss alternatives and make recommendations on production opportunities to support the base capability in the FY10 timeframe.  <BR><BR>-Q  63. Regarding the desire for fusion, open architecture and integration, what recommendations do you have for those who are not incumbents (e.g. LM, SAIC, Booz&) and not as read-in to legacy /existing systems to not get pushed out? (i.e., get adequate consideration) *Lot of language being used that only incumbents are familiar with* ANSWER -   There are no incumbents to the Governments understanding within the CBDEWS program who will be competing for the contracts.  Previous participants in the 2008 Technical Demonstration were unfunded and brought technologies and processes completely on their own.  JPM NBC CA will review contract proposals to assess prospective vendors understanding of the issues, description of proposed solutions and ability to effectively manage the time, cost and schedule.<BR><BR>-Q  64. Are there any restrictions (e.g. ITAR) on this program and info presented today?  Specifically, can a Canadian company become engaged?  ANSWER - Foreign companies are not excluded from participation.  JPM NBC CA does not expect International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions at this time and will seek appropriate export authorizations should the need arise.  <BR><BR>-Q  65. Why are you calling Phase II & III IDIQ for fusion and sensing when you show them as EMD full system program on your schedule chart  define these (i.e., EMD W/ ILS, AQ, fielding, etc.)  ANSWER -   Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III refer to different contracting activities in the near term.  EMD includes separate contracting efforts for fusion (Phase II) and sensing (Phase III).  These ID/IQ contracting efforts may also require tasks other than purely technical efforts such as ILS development, production, fielding, logistics support, etc.  These may be included as part of the award following PDR or as separate tasks.<BR><BR>-Q  66. Will attendance list be posted?  ANSWER -   An attendance list with attendee name and company name will be posted to FedBizOps at later date.<BR><BR>-Q  67. Will they publish the attendees? ANSWER -    See answer number 66.<BR><BR><BR>Point of Contact is Linda Ensminger email:  linda.ensminger@us.army.mil  telephone: 410-436-8564  fax 410-306-3796 or Cheryl McLaughlin email: cheryl.mclaughlin@us.army.mil telephone:  410-436-2209 fax 410-306-3739<BR><BR>  <BR>ATTENDANCE LIST <BR>19 February 2009 CBDEWS APBI Registrants<BR><BR>Advanced Concepts and Technologies International<BR>Steve J.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to reinstate and revise the Original Pre-Solicitation notice issued on December 11th, 2008 for the procurement of:  POWER AMPLIFIER ASSY; NSN:  5996-01-560-8971; PN: 12900638-2, which is used on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.  The Government has determined that there is no competitive TDP for this item.  Consequently, this procurement will be restricted to the current vendor, Curtiss Wright Controls, CAGE: 1XVU0, as authorized by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  This notice of intent is therefore not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources may submit proposals with supporting capability statements.  Proposals and capability statements received by the Government within 15 business days after the posting date will be evaluated.  Any interested vendor other than Curtiss Wright Controls will have to make a substantial initial investment in tooling, test equipment, and time to develop the proper automated test equipment required to successfully manufacture this item.  Interested parties please note, the Government plans to issue an award for this effort within 60-90 days.  In addition, the Government cannot provide any Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for testing purposes.<BR><BR>FOB is Destination.  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price, 3 year IDIQ with a minimum guaranteed quantity of 250 each.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501 and 5.102, therefore hard copies will not be provided.  Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aais.ria.army.mil/AAIS/Solinfo/index.htm.  <BR><BR>CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments. <BR>

<AWARDEE>Loup Loup  Ski Rental Shop, 2 Mundinger Lane

<DESC>This objective of this contract is to obtain site operator services for the operation of the instrumentation at the IMPROVE air quality site located at the Loup Loup Ski Hill in north central Washington State. No analysis of data collected is required.

The operational requirements for IMPROVE sites include labor associated with mandatory weekly visits to the site to retrieve the filters and flash cards, recording pertinent data on log sheets, replacing the filters, flash cards, and mailing of the samples. While at the site the operator is required to provide maintenance on a High-Resolution Camera System (HRDC), a Web-based camera system located at the IMPROVE site. Occasionally, minor maintenance of shelter or equipment may also be required. Site operators are required to have approximately four hours of initial training and a periodic refresher class. Initial onsite training of a new operator and a periodic refresher class will be provided by the University of California-Davis (UC-Davis). This contract requires the Contractor to furnish labor, equipment, tools, supervision, transportation, communication device and service, operating supplies, and incidentals except as indicated or furnished by the Government.

The sampling protocol for the IMPROVE site requires one trip each week within specific time frames. The Contractor is also expected to visit the site when there is a reported malfunction of the equipment and the camera located at the site occasionally requires additional maintenance. Past history indicates that there may be one additional trip to the site each month on the average
