In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.

<DESC>NSN: 4810-00-226-4107. Item Description: Valve, Solenoid. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (79318) P/N 27131244.
<p><br />Quantity: 62. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: Tinker AFB, OK. Delivery Schedule: 305 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 25 APR 2017. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. (79318).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and the other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 50-74, 75-99, and 100.</p>

<CONTACT>Robert V. Miron, Phone 2027811570, Email robert.miron@navy.mil - Steven G. Galer, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-781-2873, Email steven.galer@navy.mil
<DESC><p align="left">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-17-R-4443 for the execution of the USS Pearl Harbor (LSD 52) Fiscal Year (FY) 18 Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) on the West Coast. The 12-month Availability will include a combination of maintenance, modernization, and repair, and is expected to require a highly capable contractor with substantial facilities, to include a pier capable of servicing the USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52) and human resources capable of completing, coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair, and modernization. The anticipated contract is considered a supply contract. The supply being procured is the repaired, mission-ready vessel, which is returned to service with the USN Fleet.</p>
<p align="left">The CNO's Homeport Statute, 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c), requires a contract for short-term work for the overhaul repair, or maintenance of a naval vessel be performed at the homeport of the vessel, provided there is adequate competition. 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c)(4) defines "short term work" as work that will be for a period of 10 months or less. Since the production period for this FY18 SRA is greater than 10 months, this Availability will be competed on a coast-wide (West Coast) basis without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement. Therefore, this procurement will not be set-aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.502-2(b).</p>
<p align="left">The solicitation will be issued electronically via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://fbo.gov, and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation and any applicable amendments. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement, at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet. This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<CONTACT>Maher, Linda
<DESC>The Facilitating Access for Sustainable Trade, Revenue and Commerce (FASTRAC) activity includes the following three components for which the Agency requires Technical Assistance Services:
1.	Technical assistance services to the Palestinian Authority (PA), Government of Israel (GOI), the private sector, and civil society partners to reduce barriers to trade, movement, and access by improving trade logistics and building the capacity of Palestinian trade-related institutions.
2.	Technical assistance services to identify and ease policy and institutional constraints to the business and investment enabling environment.
3.	Technical assistance services to support targeted fiscal policy and administration initiates to help contain fiscal leakages, improve revenue performance, enhance fiscal sustainability and better manage macroeconomic risks.
USAID/West Bank and Gaza needs to procure services to provide technical assistance to the PA, as well as the Palestinian private sector, civil society, and other entities, in order to increase private sector-led economic growth in WBG.
Through the delivery of these services, USAID/WBG seeks to reduce the burden of trade-related restriction, transaction costs, and policy and institutional weaknesses, including those associated with movement and access, that undermine private sector competitiveness, discourage job creation, contribute to unsustainable trade and fiscal deficits, and threaten the foundations of macroeconomic stability in WBG, a crucial underlying driver of economic growth.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>The US Army Communications Electronics Research &amp; Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space &amp; Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) is interested in receiving information from companies that have experience in the design, development, and implementation of soldier wireless communications network for the Squad Area Network (SQAN) program. The SQAN program will focus on adapting a commercial wireless technology to meeting current Army requirements. SQAN will provide a small, low power mesh network to support intra-squad communications independent of any backhaul. This will allow for wireless communication that includes data transfer and voice between soldiers within a squad. The SQAN network shall be capable of operating in a benign, heavily contested, and lastly a congested RF environment.</p>
<p>Benign is defined as but not limited to:<br />&bull; Spectrum restrictions due to civil uses<br />&bull; Availability of military spectrum exceeds demand</p>
<p>Congested Environment is defined as but not limited to:<br />&bull; Spectrum restrictions due to host nation and civil issues<br />&bull; High military demand for spectrum (US &amp; coalition)<br />&bull; Terrain challenges (Mountains, Cities)</p>
<p>Contested Environment is defined as but not limited to:<br />&bull; Adversarial attempts to degrade/deny access to spectrum <br />&bull; Congestion due to competing military uses</p>
<p>SQAN attributes should include, but not limited to:<br />&bull; Low Probability of Interception/Low Probability of Detection<br />&bull; Adequate bandwidth that can pass voice (Push To Talk (PTT)) and data traffic (situational awareness, Position Location Information (PLI), still images etc...), <br />&bull; Anti-jam features<br />&bull; A Commercial Solution for Classified (CSfC) for security.</p>
<p>Lastly, the main objective is to provide intra-squad communications at the tactical edge.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this RFI, the SQAN program development effort will include, but not be limited to, the following activities:<br /><br />1. Defining the waveform that will provide intra-squad communications.<br />2. Defining the technology interfaces and embedment approaches for currently fielded Soldier equipment and planned future systems. <br />3. Defining the system network architecture for a low power, secure mesh network capable of intra-squad communications.<br />4. Adapting and hardening the selected SQAN technology to make it suitable for the stringent demands of the Army operating environment (LPI/LPD, AJ, etc.)<br />5. Minimizing power consumption and developing power charging architecture.<br />6. Developing and implementing a security solution adapting CSfC.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p>The US Army is focused enabling intra-squad communications within contested and congested environments using networking techniques to adapt and continue operation under interference signals. Currently, the capability described does not exist at the dismounted tactical edge.</p>
<p>To enable the Army's vision, CERDEC S&amp;TCD is looking for information to develop a Government owned SQAN solution capable of soldier-to-soldier communications. <br />Assured and resilient communications are essential characteristics. The ability to maintain communications in contested and congested environments with no backhaul are key attributes to realizing the vision of the SQAN network. Novel approaches to operating undetected, operating in the presence of Electronic Warfare (EW) attacks, and operating through or around Radio Frequency (RF) interference must be investigated, designed and validated to make the US army vision a reality.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCOPE</span></p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to solicit information regarding technologies that can provide intra-squad communications to the dismount that would serve U.S. Army goals for a Squad Area Network Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). CERDEC S&amp;TCD will be evaluating the responses to help shape and validate feasible requirements.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<p>CERDEC STCD request industry provides the following, but not limited to:</p>
<p>General<br />&bull; Statement of interest. <br />&bull; Description of qualification: demonstrated products, projects, and applicable experience. State whether your current experience is in design, development, or both. <br />&bull; Description of existing or planned work in this area. Include strategies for embedding end products into both commercial and GOTs Soldier devices. Provide information on partnerships agreements planned or existing.</p>
<p>Waveform<br />&bull; Recommendations and/or feedback on waveform(s) that can apply. Provide suggested protocols, and standards to suit the Army's needed stated within this document.<br />&bull; Recommendations on different network approaches including mesh, point to point and point to multipoint that can be utilized for the SQAN. <br />&bull; Recommendations on a waveform that can provide intra-squad communications with adequate range. The distance between soldiers within a squad can go from 100 meters to up to approximately 300 meters.<br />&bull; Recommendations on waveform that can provide adequate bandwidth that can pass voice (Push to Talk (PTT)) and data traffic (situational awareness, Position Location Information (PLI), still images etc...)</p>
<p>Power Consumption<br />&bull; Information/recommendations on power interfaces and battery sources. <br />&bull; Strategies to reduce and optimize power consumption to achieve long battery life while reducing weight.</p>
<p>Security<br />&bull; Information on security implementation approaches, reference any related experience.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFI-0001013<br /><br />CERTIFICATION OF FBI'S BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINETS</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of businesses to provide services to certify the FBI's biological safety cabinets (BSCs). The Government intends to award a contract under a separate solicitation, but with this notice wants to obtain capabilities, delivery, or other market information for planning purposes. All interested, capable, and responsible are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION:<br /></strong><br />The Occupational Safety Environmental Programs Unit (OSEP) of the FBI has a requirement to certify 466 biological safety cabinets. Responses to this RFI will be used to formulate final requirements for certification of BSCs and to identify qualified vendors capable of meeting those requirements. The description below outlines preliminary requirements envisioned for the certification of the BSCs. The information gathered will be used to formulate final requirements, which will subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids.<br /><strong><br />BACKGROUND:<br /></strong><br />The OSEP Unit of the Facilities and Logistics Services Division (FLSD) provides occupational safety, industrial hygiene, environmental and fire protection program development, implementation and oversight for the FBI enterprise wide. This includes the recertification of the 466 BSCs located in the FBI's 56 field divisions across the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam). FBI's field divisions consist of 56 field offices centrally located in major metropolitan areas, as well as a total of about 380 regional facilities (resident agencies) located in smaller cities and towns within the divisions. <br /><strong><br />CONCEPT OF OPERATION:&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />The FBI has deployed Class II BSCs for the purposes of screening incoming mail. These BSCs are manufactured by Labconco. The cabinets require annual certification/leak testing at all FBI locations. If a cabinet fails certification, it is the requirement of the contractor to purchase a replacement HEPA filter, install and retest the BSC upon approval from OSEP. The contractor can assume a 10% failure rate for the BSC certification.<br /><br />This is a non-personal services contract. The Government will not exercise any supervision or control over the contractor employees performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.<br /><strong><br />REQUIREMENTS: <br /></strong><br />The Contractor must possess the necessary skills needed to recertify BSCs.<br />The Contractor involved in this work will possess a minimum security clearance of Secret and must have Escorted Access to enter FBI facilities. To obtain escorted access, the following forms must be completed:<br /><br />&bull; FD-316 Memorandum<br />&bull; FD-816 Access of Non-FBI Personnel to FBI facilities<br />&bull; FD-484 Privacy Act Notice<br />&bull; FD-258 Fingerprint Cards (2) or Civil Applicant System (CAS) electronic fingerprint results<br />&bull; Proof of legal U.S. status if the candidate is foreign born: This documentation can be in the form of a naturalization certificate, current permanent resident card, employment authorization card or eligible work visa.<br />&bull; Consular Report of Birth Form (FS-240): This must be included if the candidate acquired U.S. citizenship through birth abroad to a U.S. citizen(s) or a naturalized U.S. citizen(s).<br />The Contractor shall provide and deliver to the FBI facilities all equipment and supplies required to inspect and recertify the BSCs.</p>

Other system users work in ORA headquarters organizations and in the compliance offices of every FDA Center. The daily work of these users includes field work, import operations, compliance actions, and laboratory operations, as well as overarching needs to plan and manage their workload and to manage the shared information about the firms that FDA regulates. Users external to the FDA also use certain ORA systems, to support collaboration and communication between federal, state, and industry participants to achieve FDA's public health mission. ORA systems are amongst FDA's most heavily used, with over 6,000 total users and as many as 600+ concurrently.</span></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The NIDA Histology Core serves NIDA- Intramural Research Program (IRP) researchers by providing access to existing and emerging neuroanatomical technologies. The NIDA Histology Core offers the following services: (1) histology services that are tailored to the needs of individual IRP researchers. Services include sectioning, immunostaining and counterstaining, whole-brain serial tomography, and imaging of cleared sample using light-sheet microscopy; and (2) training and access to different types of microscopes, 2 cryostats, one vibratome, and computers for image analysis.</p>
<p>The Core needs to increase its capabilities for fast collection of light or fluorescence high-resolution images that do not require confocal imaging. The required microscope needs to be capable of imaging entire brain sections and specific brain areas.</p>
<p>NIDA Histology Core has experienced a constant increase of users for brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. IRP requires increased accessibility for reliable fast imaging of samples by acquiring an inverted microscope that provides a user platform to image samples on plate well and another sample holder other than a slide.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong></p>
<p>IRP requires an inverted fluorescence phase contrast microscope with the following properties: <br />1. A large motorized XY stage that is integrated within the main unit and is capable of supporting multi-well plates or flasks; and <br />2. Capable of producing high-speed auto focus adjustments in the Z direction.</p>
<p><strong>Salient Characteristics:</strong></p>
<p>Prospective products must have the following capabilities: <br />1) The microscope must be capable of eliminating uneven light intensity through a high-precision shade correction algorithm in order to create seamless, high-resolution images after stitching mosaic images. <br />2) The microscope must be capable of reducing out of focus light to drastically reduce photo bleaching during observation; enhance contrast of unstained transparent specimens; and eliminate fluorescence blurring on captured images. <br />3) The microscope must be capable of capturing high definition images with superior color reproducibility to create ideal conditions for brightfield applications. <br />4) The microscope must be capable creating a real-time image overlay with up to four separate channels through a preview mode, each with its own adjustable settings, so users can modify and readjust a particular channel before overlaying and capturing the images.</p>

<DESC>Construct approximately seven new flood protection structures including dikes, berms and concrete/riprap ditches to divert flood waters away from the historic structures and visitor walkways at Scotty's Castle. The primary flood protection structure would be the reconstruction of an approximately 400-foot long gabion (rock-filled wire baskets) dike east of the Stables area in the main Grapevine Canyon channel. The previous washed out dike was constructed of native soil materials. In addition, in the two smaller washes immediately uphill of the Cook House and Stables, flood deposited sediments would be excavated, and a combination of concrete waterways and protective berms would be installed to carry storm flows around these historic structures. Dike construction is proposed as gabion-baskets, which is the typical flood protection dike structure installed in the area.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. <br /><br />This Sources Sought/Request for Information is in support of U.S. Special Operations Command, via the Naval Special Warfare Program Office within Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA 06-NSW (PMS340)). The purpose is to identify eligible contractors to manufacture up to five MK11 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) systems, with potential options for up to four additional MK11 SDV systems. This announcement is issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10, and is not to be interpreted as a commitment by the Government that a procurement action will be issued. This notice shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on part of the Government. No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information. Any information submitted by companies to this Sources Sought/Request for Information shall be voluntary.<br /><br />A potential acquisition, if any, would require the contractor to provide all manpower, materials, and facilities to fabricate, test, and deliver MK11 SDV Systems. The MK11 SDV System consists of the following: <br />1. MK11 SDV Vehicle<br />2. Mission Support Equipment<br />a. Boost Pump/Air Charging Kit<br />b. Vacuum and Purge System<br />c.

(Interested companies must be on NAVSEA NOTE5000 for DSS-SOC or be capable of and willing to achieve provisional NOTE5000 certification prior to commencing manufacturing. This qualification process is described in NAVSEAINST 4855.34C, Procedures for Qualifying and Authorizing Activities to Perform SUBSAFE, Fly-By-Wire Ship Control Systems, and Deep Submergence Systems-Scope Of Certification Work).<br />&bull; Hardware shall be tested in accordance with component/subsystem testing listed on the drawing as well as system testing in accordance with approved test procedures, to include factory acceptance testing.<br />&bull; Latest software version of the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) Source <br />Code will be provided by the Government and shall be installed by the manufacturer.<br /><br />Period of Performance. The anticipated maximum period of performance would be seven years from the date of award. If an acquisition is approved, the Government intends to award for production of the first two Systems, plus initial spares for each, in FY19. The next three Systems, plus initial spares for each, would be awarded through the exercise of options in FY20. (Given DOD budget uncertainties, the period of performance, order quantities and the timing of award dates may change). <br />Interested companies should submit their proposed timeline for production to accomplish the build of the first two Systems and then the three follow-on Systems. Delivery of first two Systems would be expected 24 months from award date.

If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF-330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Offerors will be evaluated in terms of the qualifications, competence and experience of the key personnel and technical team proposed to accomplish this work. Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise. Provide a balanced licensed and or certified workforce in the following disciplines   
Engineering (Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Interior Design, Fire Protection) and Architecture, 

Submission requirements: Provide resumes for all proposed key personnel. Resumes are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience and indicate proposed role in this contract. Provide professional registration, certification, licensure and/or accreditation. Indicate participation of key personnel in example projects in the SF-330 Part 1 Section G.

Criterion 3 - Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms/teams will be evaluated in terms of their ability to plan for and manage work under the contract and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm s ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm s capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance   Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower. NOTE: Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1.

Submission requirements: SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE. IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF-330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 2 Attn: Rachel Beason via email at Rachel.Beason@va.gov prior to the response date.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A/E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.

Criterion 5 - Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.  

Submission requirements: Offerors shall submit evidence of individuals experience and qualifications in their respective fields.  Additionally, documentation must be provided to show these individuals have worked together as a team on previous projects and their role.

Evaluation Scoring

Evaluation factors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be evaluated using the following adjectival ratings as follows:

Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. 
Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. 
Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.  
Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is not awardable. The firm s proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement and the approach fails to meet performance standards. The firm s proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of requirement.

The ratings identified below were used in the evaluation of Past Performance (Criterion 4):

Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Little doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they could satisfy the requirements of the contract.
Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.
Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Some doubt exists based on past performance that they could satisfy the terms and conditions of the contract.
No Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectations that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Significant doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to </span>license a new technology for commercialization.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br /><strong>Background</strong></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><strong>: <br /></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a direct write technique that enables fabrication of macroscale complex 3D structures with submicron features. In this process, writing of complex structures is achieved through a serial writing technique wherein a high light intensity spot is sequentially scanned in 3D space to generate the entire structure. Due to the serial writing scheme, the rate of writing is fundamentally limited to such an extent that two-photon lithography of large volumes of functional parts is not feasible. Although attempts to increase the rate via parallelization have been made in the past, such attempts have failed to achieve the same degree of pattern complexity as that available in the point-scanning serial technique. Specifically, past parallelization efforts have either generated arrays of identical features or printed 2D parts with no depth resolvability.<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>LLNL has solved the challenges of depth-resolved parallel TPL by using a temporal focusing technique in addition to the spatial focusing technique used in serial writing systems. We temporally focus the beam (through optical set-up design) so that a sharp Z-plane can be resolved while projecting 2D "light sheets" that cause localized photo-polymerization. This enables printing of complex 3D structures in a parallel fashion. To minimize the errors arising from discretization of 3D structures, LLNL has also developed techniques to "bend" the 2D light sheet into a 3D surface for printing of curved features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />The inventive elements of LLNL's apparatus are the arrangement of the laser light, the digital mask, and the axis of the collimating optics and the relative size of the collimating optics to ensure that temporal focusing of the projected light sheet is achieved.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Livermore's innovative technology also comprises the grayscale printing method that ensures that high-quality parts can be fabricated. Our grayscale printing technique comprises the sequence of operations and the selection of writing conditions in these operations that leads to a non-uniform dosage during printing.<br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />Advantages</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's parallel two-photon lithography technique ensures a depth resolution less than 5 microns and an in-plane feature size less than 350 nm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LLNL's technique appears functionally similar to DMD-based parallelization in projection micro-stereolithography systems, however it implements a fundamentally different optical system to ensure that the light sheet is both spatially and temporally focused.<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><br />By overcoming the barrier to depth resolvability in femtosecond projection optics, LLNL<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong>has successfully increased the rate by a factor of 50X while still maintaining the &lt; 350 nm feature size resolutions of high-quality serial techniques. In addition, bending of the light sheet into 3D surfaces minimizes discretization errors during printing of curved structures. LLNL's techniques eliminate a fundamental barrier to scaling up submicron additive manufacturing and transforms two-photon lithography into a serious contender for high-volume additive manufacturing of functional parts with nanoscale features.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1
For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($150K)

Acquisition Plan Action ID:VA262-18-AP-4930

Contracting Activity:  The agency responsible for this acquisition is: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 22, Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHS). The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Monica Griffin. VALLHS proposes  to enter into an emergency purchase order on the basis of other than full and open competition for maintenance and repair of the Fuel Cell power plant system. Purchase Request Number is: 605-18-2-6027-0034.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  This is an urgent and compelling procurement for maintenance and repair of the VALLHS Fuel Cell Power Plant System. The current contract expires on February 9, 2018. The fuel cell power plant system is a co-generation plant that produces eight hundred (800) KW of continuous power feeding the hospital as a supplemental electricity and supplemental heat for domestic hot water and the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) building reheat systems.Co-generation plant saves the facility up to $800,000 a year in energy cost and reduces wear and tear in boiler and chiller plant operations.Without the co-generation plant, the boiler and chiller plant operation will be impacted by not pre-heating the supply and returning the domestic hot water system and HVAC hot water reheat system which will result in not maintaining the required temperature in facility distribution system.The amount of the six (6) month purchase order is $130,470.50 for the period of February 9, 2018-July 7, 2018.

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used: These services were needed immediately because the current contract will expire on February 9 and there isn t enough time to put a long-term contract in place. Doosan Fuel Cell America, Inc., is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the PureCell System Model 400 Fuel Cells installed at VALLHS as part of a previously awarded Combined Heat and Power Renewable Energy Project. The fuel cell power plant is a critical equipment and can only be maintained by factory trained technicians to prevent costly repairs and the non-operation of VALLHS. 

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted: FAR Part 10 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances. Due to this being an emergency, market research was not conducted as the healthcare system is in jeopardy of not having the power-plant maintained.

Contracting Officer's Certification: I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT
<p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), NOAA Ship Henry Bigelow requires 550 gallons of Panolin HLP Synthetic Hydraulic Oil in 55 gallon drums, as this is the current hydraulic oil being utilized throughout the ship. This product will be provided by Panolin America, Inc. 4882 McGrath St. STE. 220, Ventura CA 93003-7721, U.S.</p>
<p>Panolin America, Inc. is the only provider for biodegradable Panolin oil for the US Government on the US East Coast. The Ship currently has Panolin hydraulic oil onboard throughout all hydraulic systems. Biodegradable hydraulic oil is the marine responsible oil required by OMAO Policy. When the policy requiring biodegradable hydraulic oil was first introduced, the ship purchased Panolin HLP Synth in bulk. All equipment on the ship is using Panolin HLP Synth. Oils of different brand types should not be mixed in order to avoid performance issues and chemical degradation between oil types. Mixing oil other than Panolin into the existing supply of Panolin could cause significant and irreparable damage to expensive and mission critical hydraulic systems used aboard ship, causing loss of project time and efficiency while replacement of damaged equipment occurred.</p>
<p>Panolin oil was supplied in bulk during Contract: EA-133M-17-SE-0362 when the vessel underwent Hydraulic System cleaning, and OMAO Policy required Bio-Degradable Oil be used on all NOAA Vessels.</p>
<p>The requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>Provide 550 gallons Hydraulic Oil in 55 gallon drums for the NOAA Ship Henry B. Bigelow. Hydraulic oil to be provided:<br />Panolin HLP Synth: <br />a. Fully Synthetic Ester<br />b. Biodegradable<br />c. Non-Toxic<br />d. 100% Saturated ester oil complying with VDMA 24568 and ISO 15380 HEES<br />e. Viscosity: ISO 46<br />f. Refer to attached Executive Summary for performance characteristics</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>Delivery Date to be coordinated with Ship based on schedule. Delivery shall be no later than 02/23/2018.</p>
<p>The ship is currently going through dry dock repairs. We need the Panolin shipped to the Colonna's Shipyard at 400 East Indian River Road, Norfolk, VA 23523. This oil is to replenish our reserve tanks for other hydraulic systems, so the fluid is not taken from the primary tank for mission critical hydraulic systems.</p>
<p><br />The Government is not aware of any other vendors that can provide this specialized service while also meeting all of the requirements listed above.</p>
<p><br />The intended procurement is for replenish hydraulic fluid currently using aboard the NOAA Ship Henry Bigelow. The Government intends to acquire services under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Panolin America, Inc under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 325110, Petrochemical Manufacturing with a business size standard of 1000 employees. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 5:00 PM EST on February 15, 2018. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Christopher Baker at Christopher.baker@noaa.gov by 5:00 PM EST on February 12, 2018.</p>

<SUBJECT>58--ARGOS EAR TAGS FOR POLAR BEARS
<SOLNBR>140G0318Q0035
<CONTACT>Evans, Stewart
<DESC>ARGOS EAR TAGS FOR POLAR BEARS: This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole source Purchase Order for unusual or compelling urgency to Telonics Inc., Mesa, AZ for 30 EA Model Number ETA-2620 Argos Ear Tags for Polar Bears.  Included will be Ear Tag applicators. 

The USGS has a requirement for ear tags which are light weight and of a small enough size that the polar bears will not tear their ear tissue to remove the tag. Additionally, the tags must also allow for satellite transmission of location denning and movement data. To the knowledge of the USGS, Telonics is the only known source who can meet both the technical requirements and the time constraints required to deploy the ear tags before the March/April 2018 deployment.

Due to a short notice mission change in the Arctic Region 1002, Polar Bears must tagged to monitor their movements and denning location during the winter months. To accomplish this goal, the Polar Bears must be tagged in March and April as the sea ice, daylight and weather conditions are optimal.  No other season allows for a better opportunity.

The salient characteristics of the ear tags are:

Timing Accuracy: 
6 min a year at 25 degree C
30 Min a year -20 to + 40 degree C
47 Min Year -40 to -70 degree C

Operating Frequencies:
401.6300Mhz to 401.6800 MHz in 1 KHz Steps
Brazillian SCD-1: Channels C1 to C9
401.6180 MHz to 401.6220MHz in 500 Hz Steps

Frequency Stability:
Plus or Minus 0.5 ppm maximum from -30 degree to +70 degree C
Plus or Minus 0.2 ppm maximum from -40 degree to -30 degree C

Initial Frequency Error:
Plus or Minus 0.5 ppm maximum at +23 C plus or minus 2 degrees.

Frequency Aging:
Plus or Minus 2.0 ppm maximum after 1 year.

Award will be made on or about 12 February to insure a late March delivery date.

Any potential Contractors capable of meeting all the technical requirements and the delivery date of late March may submit their quote.  All submissions will be reviewed. 

Submission of Proposals:  Proposals shall only be accepted through electronic mail addressed to sevans@usgs.gov. All proposal documents required by this solicitation must be uploaded and received in their entirety no later than 02/121/2018, 1000 PST.  Proposals submitted by hardcopy or the FedConnect web portal or Fed Connect Message Center shall not be accepted or considered.

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

Additional requirements will be addressed when implemented.</p>

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>
