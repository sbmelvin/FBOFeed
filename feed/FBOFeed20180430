<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) requires upgrading the Penstock No. 5 Hydraulic Gate including </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">installation of new stainless steel hydraulic piping and pressure testing the piping</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> at Amistad Dam is located <span style="color: black;">about 15 miles from downtown Del Rio, TX. </span></span></p>

<p class="p2" style="margin-left: .5in;">Penstock #5 was originally designed to be a &ldquo;dual gated&rdquo; 15-foot irrigation outlet (penstock).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Both gates were designed as tractor (cable operated) gates and weigh 48,000 pounds each.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The dual gates are generally referred to as the Upstream Penstock Gate (aka head gate) and the Downstream Penstock Gate (aka operating or irrigation gate) and are positioned approximately 10 feet apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Depending on the action or results desired these gates could be lowered 190 feet down their respective Upstream or Downstream gate slots or could be hung in the penstock service bay, located 190 feet above the penstock invert, for servicing.</p>
<p class="p2" style="margin-left: .5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2" style="margin-left: .5in;">During construction, the downstream (irrigation) gate was replaced with a hydraulic slide gate. The upstream (head gate) was left as originally designed and is currently in the down (or closed) position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Upstream of both penstock #5 gates is a bulkhead gate slot; however (by design) only one (1) Bulkhead Gate was delivered at Amistad during construction and it is currently being used in Penstock# 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="p2" style="margin-left: .5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2" style="margin-left: .5in;">The hydraulic gate has been in the closed position since at least 2010, and the following observations were made during the last, (unsuccessful) attempt to operate the gate:</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334418 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
<p><br />AFRL requires two (2) Radio Platform Configuration Kits containing a unique set of hardware accessories designed to configure a radio platform utilizing a DRI Polaris HF/UHF/VHF Digital Tuner into a customer designed chassis and container for operational utilization. This kit is specifically designed for use in the Government's specialized configuration for a DRS Polaris HF/UHF/VHF Digital Tuner and includes chassis and product specific components that interface seamlessly with the customer's platform and chassis requirements. Further the kit is also capable of surviving the extreme environmental conditions in which the platforms are used. The kit is uniquely constructed utilizing custom hardware thermal solutions that are precisely configured. It is in wide use with customers within the ISR community and purchase of these specific items will ensure AFRL derived technology will transition in an operational format compatible with the ISR community platform assets. A substitute would not be compatible and would prevent transition of AFRL technology. Compatibility with the DRS Polaris Digital Tuner is imperative. There are no other known vendors that exist that have the required compatibility kit.</p>
<p>Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements. Current research the Government performs will not be transferrable to the operational platforms, and the research program will not be successful, ultimately any research conducted will be wasted.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Embedded Solutions, 4411 Morena Blvd., Suite 101, San Diego, CA 92117-4345, manufacturer of the required Radio Platform Configuration Kits.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Tabitha.Haggart@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 31 May 2018.</p>

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

Specifically, requirement involves supplies for reverse transcription and detection of Mayaro nucleic acid from serum, whole blood, tissue, infected mosquitoes, and cell culture via RT and PCR (SOP N6-VIR-MB ARB 007); detection of Alphavirus RNA using a molecular method in two steps from serum, whole blood, autopsy tissue, infected mosquitoes pools and mosquito cell culture (SOP N6-VIR-MB ARB 008); identify Oropouche RNA from serum, whole blood, autopsy tissue, and infected mosquitoes pools, and mosquito cell culture (SOP N6-VIR-MB ARB 009); screening to identify Arenavirus new world viruses RNA from serum, whole blood, autopsy tissue, and infected mosquitoes pools, and mosquito cell culture (N6-VIR-MB ARB 011); and, discrimination and identification of the four serotypes of dengue virus (Den 1, Den 2, Den 3 and Den 4) RNA from serum, whole blood, autopsy tissue, and infected mosquitoes pools, and mosquito cell culture (N6-VIR-MB ARB 015).<br />All assays have been developed independently for each SOP followed in the laboratories, and consumables used must remain the same as the ones specified in the SOPs, otherwise, the design and validation of these processes would have to be initiated from zero, which would delay all processing and the timely diagnosis of public health relevant pathogens.<br />This pre-solicitation is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement.
