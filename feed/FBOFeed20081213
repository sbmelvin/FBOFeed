<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is seeking qualified sources to provide EEO Counseling, Training, Investigation, Final Agency Decisions, and Mediation Services to support its Washington, DC and Miami, FL offices and overseas locations on a contract basis.  The Agency intends to issue one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to qualified vendors.

The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements.

Prospective contractors are hereby notified that the basis for award will be based on best value, with technical evaluation factors (i.e., strength of prospective contractor’s experience, resume, approach, and oral/written skills) being more important than the prospective contractor's proposed hourly price.  Offerors shall also submit a price proposal that includes their fully burdened (i.e., inclusive of overhead & profit) hourly rate.  All sources who believe that they have the experience and capabilities to perform one or more of the above-stated services to be procured under a contract basis from BBG may submit written inquiries for additional information and/or submit their written statement (i.e., technical and price data) to Mr. Michael D.

<DESC>NOTICE OF AMENDMENT TO ANNOUNCEMENT NO. N69450-09-R-NCBC:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS HEREBY AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
1.	THE SOLICITATION NUMBER, N69450-09-R-NCBC, HAS BEEN CHANGED.   THE NEW REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) NUMBER IS NOW N69450-09-R-3574.  PLEASE REFER TO RFP# N69450-09-R-3574 FOR ANY FUTURE CORRESPONDENCE REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION. 
2.	THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE RESTRICTED TO QUALIFIED 8(a) FIRMS AS FOLLOWS PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF THE MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT: "FOR THIS PROCUREMENT, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT COMPETITION WILL BE LIMITED TO 8(A) FIRMS LOCATED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SERVICED BY THE SBA-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT OFFICE AND UNDER THE STAFFORD ACT DUE TO THE GULF COAST RECOVERY FROM HURRICANE KATRINA, WHICH HAS NAICS CODE 236220.   ALL OTHER FIRMS ARE DEEMED INELIGIBLE TO SUBMIT OFFERS."
THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  The solicitation will be available on or about Monday, January 5, 2009 at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (Jacksonville, FL Office) is currently seeking businesses certified for the 8(a) program for Solicitation Number N69450-09-R-3574 to obtain construction services for the Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC) that will entail a design-build project named the 25th Naval Construction Regiment HQ Facility located at NCBC Gulfport MS, Gulfport, MS.  Again, this solicitation is being restricted to qualified 8(a) firms serviced by the Small Business Administration Office of Mississippi District only.
The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $33,500,000.  The project is being solicited as Design/Construct to Budget with the maximum Award Amount at $7,600,000.  
Offerors submitting proposal in excess of this amount will be considered to have a deficiency.  The Government will award a Firm-Fixed Price Contract resulting from the solicitation to the responsible, responsive, offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, and is considered to be the best value to the Government, price and technical factors considered.
This project consists of design, site development for, and construction of a new 22,987 square foot specialized office building to house the functional space for the 25th NCR Command and Control staff to carry out their mission.  This project includes administrative offices, training space, SCIF room, auditorium, data center, file storage, associated support areas, electrical and mechanical utilities, demolition, paving and site improvements.  The location for the new facility will be adjacent and connected to the 22nd NCR Command and Control on the Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC) in Gulfport, Mississippi.
The project will create a single two-story building that will have a high level of security throughout most of the building and, therefore, will have multiple levels of access control. This facility is classified as a "Primary Gathering Building" according to Antiterrorism (AT) criteria and will require compliance with all the related protective measures.
The space within this facility consists of a combination of private and open offices along with multiple conference and planning rooms sized to accommodate from 12 to 117 people. There will be two data (network) systems included, one of which is a secure system requiring "physical" security of the distribution components, and there is a related Data Center that will be shared among the two Command and Control facilities.  The Electronic Security System (ESS) described in section D503005 is to be excluded from the base bid and priced as an option. The option does not count against the $7.6M budget limitation.
Site development shall include earthwork, paved parking and access ways, landscaping, utility distributions, and storm water collection/distribution. This facility is to be joined to the first Command and Control Facility on the site. This facility will provide shared space for the original facility. Therefore, the site layout and the building organization (floor plans) must be coordinated to facilitate construction and integration/connection of the original Command and Control building.  The exterior of this project shall match the first Command and Control Facility, i.e. the intent is to give the appearance of a single facility upon completion.
This facility shall be designed to be accessible to the handicapped and shall meet requirements of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) along with Department of Defense policies. 
4.  Bid to budget details:	This project is solicited as Design/Construct to Budget with the maximum Award Amount at $7,600,000.  Offerors submitting proposal in excess of this amount will be considered to have a deficiency.  If the offeror finds the full scope cannot be delivered within the budget identified then the offeror may reduce scope as described below.  The scope reductions are prioritized and reductions must be taken in the order listed below.  If the scope is reduced, it is the responsibility of the offeror to clearly articulate the scope reductions exercised.  The amount of scope provided in the offeror's proposal will impact the final evaluation for "Factor 3- Technical Solution".
The scope reductions allowed to meet the project's budget is as follows:
.	A - Delete all demolition and all new construction associated with the new 75 space parking lot to be located south of the 25th NCR HQ Facility, between Third Street and Snead Street..	B - Delete the 36 space parking lot located between the 22nd NCR HQ facility (currently under construction) and Bldg. 60..	C - Reduce capacity of auditorium to accommodate approximately 50 personnel, in lieu of the 117 person capacity..	D - Eliminate reduced auditorium in its entirety..	E - Delete requirement for storage in Data Center.
5.  Provide as Bid Options:
