These functions are in addition to modifications, and normal maintenance requirements. It should be noted that although this work is being performed in Korea, it is not an FMS requirement. Also, period of performance for this requirement is planned for ten (10) years, but may be decreased prior to award. If the current planned schedule is followed, performance for this effort will begin 01 October 2011. Also, to the government's knowledge, these program requirements render this effort sole source to Korean Air, CAGE (1E67F). Anyone who feels they can meet these requirements are encouraged to submit the appropriate documentation to be reviewed by our government Program Manager. It should also be noted that this requirement will not be delayed for qualification purposes.

<DESC>RECOVERY  INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT (ISRDS) CONTRACTNUMBER NNA08CG83C. THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLEONLY TO STINGER GHAFFARIAN TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (SGT, INC.) UNDER CONTRACT NUMBERNNA08CG83C FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT (ISRDS) AT NASA AMESRESEARCH CENTER (ARC) LOCATED AT MOFFETT FIELD, CA.  THIS IS AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA).	 ARC intends to issue Task Order 84, titled Impact of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)Operations in the NAS. This task supports NASA Recovery Act work sponsored by theAeronautics Research Mission Directorate and the Airspace Systems Program.  Researchfunded by this task will focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing the USnational airspace. It is forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in the UnitedStates will double, far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely flyaircraft. To handle this growth, NASA is contributing toward the development of the NextGeneration Air Transportation Management System (NextGen).  Airspace simulations andmodeling are important methods used by researchers to create a future national airspacesystem that is safe and reliable.  Many future concepts, such as allowing Unmanned AirSystems (UAS) to routinely operate in the airspace, require simulations which model notonly our current airspace but also a future airspace with more aircraft and increasinglycomplex operations.  In support of this effort, the contractor shall use modeling and simulation tools toconduct an assessment of the impact that UAS operations will have on the current andfuture airspace.  This includes generating modeling data (or a demand data set) for theexperiment and performing a gap analysis.  The objective of this work is to enhanceexisting government tools to generate demand data sets that can be used to model currentand future UAS operations.  This data set and others generated will be used to determinethe impact of UAS operations under a variety of conditions.  Additionally, usingpublically available literature, the contractor shall prepare a gap analysis whichidentifies issues specific to the future air traffic system known as NextGen.  Inaddition to the analysis, the contractor shall provide the government with copies of allsoftware, software administrative and users guides, models, and data used in the courseof this task. For all work produced in this task, the government has a strong preferencefor data, methods, tools, algorithms and technologies which are openly available and donot require any sensitive or propriety protections.  Where the contractor utilizessensitive or proprietary information, they will be responsible for the appropriatehandling and protection of the information.  Additionally, should any of this informationbe included in deliverables, the contractor shall guarantee the document containing theinformation and information itself is properly marked to ensure properhandling/protection.Task Order 84 will be funded by the Recovery Act.  A contract modification will be issuedto fully fund this task order.	The Intelligent Systems Research and Development Support(ISRDS) contract number NNA08CG83C was made on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  This announcement will not result in a Request for Proposal.  This announcement is forinformational purposes only. All questions and/or concerns must be submitted to the pointof contact contained herein in writing via e-mail to the following address:sarah.m.andrae@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The infrastructure being implemented at ESOC West is a replication of the existing infrastructure currently in place at the ESOC East.This establishment of ESOC West is a key component of the Data Center Consolidation program.  ESOC West will be one of two production data centers that will house all of the Departments production servers up to the Secret classification level.  This acquisition will provide backup servers for the virtual infrastructure to host those production applications.  The servers will serve as backups to the blade servers that function as the primary support of the virtual infrastructure.. 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Paragraph (c) provides for use of a brand name procurement.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as key components of the ESOC West IT infrastructure.  This purchase is one of several to replicate the Departments existing ESOC East IT infrastructure.  Question 3 above addresses the historical background of this issue more fully.The requirement will be completed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.
Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), Paragraph 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures.
The FAA intends to negotiate and award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order for Infra-Red (IR) Cameras and Electro-Optical (EO) Cameras (with Camera Housings), and Pan/Tilt Platforms, Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) (aka RVSS Camera Bundle) for FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs Border Protection (CBP) to L-3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics Corporation, Mason, OH under Request for Offer (RFO) DTFAAC-10-R-02332 to provide all necessary labor, facilities, equipment, materials, travel, and subcontractors (as applicable) to  supply: Infra-Red (IR) Cameras (Quantity 4), Electro-Optical (EO) Cameras (Quantity 2), and Pan / Tilt Platform (Quantity 2), to include shipping.  The contractor shall be required to deliver cameras and platforms based on the Government's delivery schedule.  
The FAA has made a single source determination insofar that L-3 Communications was the supplier of the current fixed tower system and is in production of the required items such that they can meet the lengthy lead time and urgent nature of this purchase.  There are no spares presently available for these system items.  Inability to have readily available spares should mechanical failures occur in the field would compromise the nation's border protection ability.  It would not be cost-effective or practical for any other sources to acquire and/or develop manufacturing capabilities for this item given the FAA's delivery requirements, manufacturing lead time, and procurement lead time for these immediate spares.  A fair and reasonable price will be negotiated by FAA with L-3 for all deliverables under this acquisition.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  
The FAA anticipates a need for additional spares beyond this single source order and is seeking interested parties under Announcement #9627 posted 16 June 2010.  That announcement outlines the Market Survey response requirements for Interested Sources for future acquisitions of these same items.  Equipment performance requirements for each item are provided in that announcement.   Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Shauna Martinez, Contract Specialist, by 4:00 PM CT, 23 June 2010, via email at shauna.martinez@faa.gov
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred and associated with any response to this announcement.

<CONTACT>Jody L. O'Kash, Email Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Food and Drug and Administration intends to award a contract using full and open competition to provide Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) for FDA Empirica Signal Software. The NAICS code is 541511. The small business size standard is $25M. This is a commercial acquisition prepared in accordance with FAR Subparts 12 and 15.
<p>The anticipated contract type is Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The minimum order value will be met by issuance of concurrent task orders. Therefore, no funds are awarded with the issuance of an IDIQ contract. The maximum cumulative ordering ceiling value for a five year IDIQ period is anticipated to be approximately $14 million. Each individual task order issued under this contract may be a firm fixed price, time and material, labor hours or a combination thereof. The Period of Performance is five years.</p>
<p>The data used by Empirica Signal Software is the result of data extract from FDA's adverse event data repositories into a data warehouse. In this data warehouse, data management services are performed such as standardizing product names against a product dictionary and a duplicate report algorithm is used to eliminate duplicate reports. This data set is then extracted from the data warehouse for use by Empirica Signal. Empirica Signal software provides a reproducible and systematic approach to see important and useful safety signals. It is an effective tool for the early detection of previously unknown adverse reactions to both newly approved and established regulated products. Empirica Signal provides multiple graphical illustrations of data that can serve as valuable input to the overall process of product safety monitoring and review. Safety signals identified by Empirica Signal are individual product-event combinations that occur in a higher than expected proportion. These signals are carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be taken. These regulatory actions might include additional information to the product label, programs to mitigate risk for the product, or in extreme cases removal of the product from the market.</p>
<p>Please note that FDA is not seeking licenses for software, rather, it is seeking technical support for data management, software configuration, software implementation and training. Currently, FDA has multiple Centers that are utilizing the Empirica Signal Detection for their signal detection management needs. The intent is to provide support for each center. The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around July 1, 2010. The solicitation no. is FDA-SOL-10-1071337. Offerors will be given an opportunity to submit questions via e-mail ONLY after the solicitation is issued. All questions and answers will be posted to www.fedbizopps.gov. No phone calls please.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO LOCKHEED MARTIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS DESIGNERS, INC. (LMSD) FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to an existing, competitively awarded Task Order.  Task Order 0030 was awarded to LMSD. under an existing, competitively awarded Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (TIRNO-06-D-00013) using fair opportunity provisions outlined in Far Part 16.  LMSD is a large business that was selected for award.  Twenty-one large and small businesses were solicited.  The modification will be executed as a firm fixed-price  award fee action.

This procurement provides for software development, testing, configuration management and project management support to the IRS Integrated Customer Communications Environment (ICCE) program.  ICCE provides software applications and connections for both phone and web interactive applications, including economic stimulus related applications.  The existing economic stimulus component of ICCE is being modified to accommodate Voice Response Unit (VRU) message changes that are in response to legislative initiatives resulting from Homebuyer Tax Credit initiatives.  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established a tax credit for first-time homebuyers worth up to $7,500.   ARRA expanded the first-time homebuyer credit by increasing the amount to $8,000.   The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009, signed into law on Nov. 6, 2009, extends and expands the first-time homebuyer credit allowed by previous Acts, which requires expansion of the existing task order.

<DESC>The National Park Service is soliciting interested and qualified parties for the award of an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract to repair, remove and/or replace, or install new barbed wire or wildlife fencing as needed on lands within the boundaries of Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS) or PRNS managed lands of Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Seashore is located in central California, in western Marin County, approximately 40 miles northwest of the city of San Francisco. The Seashore includes beaches, coastal cliffs and headlands, marine terraces, coastal uplands, woodlands and forests. Project area lands fall under one of two management zones: Natural Resource Zones (pastoral lands, natural landscape areas, sensitive resources, designated wilderness, and marine reserves) or Historic Resource Zones (historic ranches). Fencing locations may vary within these areas and are categorized as follows: 1) flat, with direct access by vehicle; 2) low gradient hills; 3) steep hillslopes; 4) brushy; and/or 5) water crossings. Fences shall be constructed with High Tensile Barbed Wire - five wire, four feet high, using metal T-posts at 10' spacing with a wooden post every sixth post (inline posts). The top and bottom wire shall be 12.5 gauge barbless stranded wire. The middle three wires shall be 15.5 gauge high tensile barbed wire. Single H Braces shall be installed at ends, both sides of gates, and at a maximum of 300 foot intervals. Double H Braces shall be installed at direction changes and major slope changes. Rise and Dip Posts shall be installed as needed. All posts shall be solidly set or driven in compacted soil to a depth of 3.5 feet. The height to the top wire shall be 48 inches and wire spacing from the ground up shall be in inches: 10, 9, 9, 9, 10. The height of all posts after installation shall be 4.5 feet.
The Seashore anticipates 1-3 projects per year at a range between $5,000-$50,000. No individual project order is anticipated to exceed $100,000. The resulting contract will be awarded for a period of one year with options to renew three additional years. Award selection will be based on a Best Value determination made after consideration of price and factors other than price (previous experience, past performance, etc) as outlined in the solicitation). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available via electronic commerce only and may be accessed on/about July 1, 2010 at either http://www.fbo.gov or directly through the DOI National Business Center website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after the date of issuance of the RFP. The Contractor is responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFP.
This acquisition is being solicited under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988 (Title VII, Public Law 100-656) and is unrestricted (full and open competition). The NAICS code is 238990 and the small business size standard is $14.0 million. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which, if timely received, will be considered. The NPS welcomes the participation of small, minority, women, and service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises capable of fulfilling this requirement.

<DESC>RECOVERYThis project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act.Architect/Engineering Design Services.  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO ANDREWS AND ANDERSON ARCHITECTS, Contract No. 1443C2000080300, as a logical follow-on task order.  NAICS code 541310.
The A/E has been involved in this project as a subcontractor from the initial scoping through preparation of construction documents under the auspices of a previous contract which expired on November 16, 2008.  To actively seek and procure the services of any other A&E firm to perform these services would be a detriment to the park, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Department of Interior.  A firm other than Andrews & Anderson would have a difficult time getting up to speed on the previous work on this project.  Bringing in another firm would surely cost the Federal Government more money and more time.
The selected A/E will perform A/E construction services for this project - submittal review, coordination of sustainability requirements, office services, and site visits as needed.

<DESC>To:  All Recipients of the prospectus, YOSE005 to operate An Urgent Care Medical Clinic within Yosemite National Park.Written Questions Regarding Solicitation YOSE005-11		No.	Question	Response1	Can you provide the time of day and year when, on average, the highest acuity patients arrive?	Existing Concessioner chooses not to disclose this information because it could constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information that the existing Concessioner is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.2	Can you provide average number of patients per day based on month and time of day?	Existing Concessioner chooses not to disclose this information because it could constitute trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information that the existing Concessioner is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.4	Initial investment itemization details	The only information available is located on Page 18 of the Business Opportunity.  5	Staffing mix	Existing Concessioner chooses not to disclose this information because it could constitute trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information that the existing Concessioner is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.6	Overhead costs	Existing Concessioner chooses not to disclose this information because it could constitute trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information that the existing Concessioner is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.7	Current payor mix	Existing Concessioner chooses not to disclose this information because it could constitute trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information that the existing Concessioner is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.8	# days in A/R	Existing Concessioner chooses not to disclose this information because it could constitute trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information that the existing Concessioner is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.9	How is the clinic currently licensed ambulatory, office, urgent, etc?	For billing purpose DMC bills as a doctor's office. 10	Preview the service contract and all exhibits	A copy of the existing contract is provided on the Website and contained on the disk in the prospectus. 11	As we explore the feasibility of submitting a proposal for the Concession agreement for Yosemite Medical Clinic.  It would be helpful to have a copy of the recent study done by PCW.  I suspect it may be available under the freedom of information act.  Could you please determine if and how I can get a copy?	A formal request can be made through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request directed to Region Director, Pacific West Region, 1111 Jackson Avenue, Suite 700, Oakland, CA  94607.  For your reference studies of this nature are exempt from FOIA because they are pre-decisional documents.12	 Do you think the Clinic would remain a Service contract if urgent care does not allow returning patients from the community or workers comp?  Wont changing to urgent care drastically reduce the service to the community?	The NPS change from a medical clinic to an urgent care clinic has nothing to do with whether a contract is deemed exempt from the Service Contract Act.  Please refer to the July 2006 Department of Labor Wage and Hour Bulletin entitled "Coverage for Concession Contracts under the Service Contract Act."  

YOSE005-11 - Modification #1
This clarification is being issued to respond to comments received under the solicitation. On page 13 of the Business Opportunity, second paragraph, the Service indicated that the existing concessioner fulfills its requirement of providing 24 hour emergency medical care by providing a telephonic "nurse-on-call" when the clinic is closed.  
This should be changed to read:  "The existing concessioner's nighttime call-back responsibility is fulfilled by physicians rather than mid-level practitioners.  In every case, a nurse responds to the clinic to meet with a patient requesting after-hours treatment.  The nurse contacts the on-call physician to make arrangements for the physician to meet the patient at the clinic.  Upon evaluation of the patient by the physician, the patient is released or transported from the park by ambulance or private vehicle."
Further we are clarifying that House #65 is a four-bedroom residence rather than a three-bedroom home.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Computation Center for Toxicology, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina has a requirement for the use of cell, organ or organism culture systems with complex and diverse biological capacities in order to measure chemical effects on critical pathways, processes and phenotypes relevant to human and ecological toxicity.  Results from such screening studies would be used in the EPA?s ToxCast? and Virtual Tissues Programs.  The EPA requires a Contractor to use validated, human, rodent, fish, amphibian or other systems with, for instance, the capacity for: metabolism of chemicals; differentiation of cells; cell to cell signaling; steroidogenesis; gene
expression or epigenetic changes. Possible culture systems could include primary cells, stable cell lines, pluripotent cells, organotypic cultures, or simple but whole organisms useful for evaluating the effects of thousands of environmental compounds. The EPA requires a Contractor to use validated, complex culture systems with cells, tissues or organisms relevant to predictive toxicology and useful in evaluating the effects of a large library of compounds on those systems.  In proposing assays, emphasis should be placed on the representation of complex biological capacities and responses of biological systems with the capability to be run in a reproducible, quantitative high throughput manner. The EPA will provide compounds at a 
minimum of 20 samples and a maximum of 3,000 samples per order.  Each order of samples shall be processed and data submitted to EPA within 60 days of receipt of samples.  The Government will order processing of a minimum of 100 samples for some combination of one or more CLIN, and a maximum of 10,000 samples for each CLIN during the anticipated contract. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  EPA has determined that this action will be processed as a full and open competition.  The award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract is anticipated with a 12 month base period and four option periods of 12 months each. Solicitation PR-NC-09-
10693, Request for Proposal (RFP), will be available on or around July 2, 2010.  Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the RFP issue date. No further synopsis will be issued.  The solicitation and any subsequent amendments will only be available via the EPA RTP Procurement Website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Hard copies or diskettes will not be available.  Telephone and fax requests for a copy will not be honored.  It will be your responsibility to frequently check the same website for any amendments or additional information that may become relevant, such as a pre-proposal conference.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), for Design/Build or Construction type task orders.  Task orders issued under this MATOC can require performance of work anywhere within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi).  Projects will typically be located on military installations within these boundaries.  A project requiring use of civil funds or otherwise termed as civil construction is not authorized under this contract.<BR><BR>This acquisition is being restricted as a Small Business Set-Aside. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $499M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $499M. The government will use a two-phase design build evaluation process. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $1M and $40M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order may include options. <BR><BR>Description of work: Task orders placed under this MATOC may be either of a design-build nature or that of a design-bid-build (construction only) nature.  Work may include but is not limited to the design and construction of administrative facilities, recreational facilities, educational facilities, religious facilities, medical facilities, and training facilities to include ranges.  Work is not solely restricted to new construction but may also include repairs, renovations, alterations, or additions to existing buildings, such as those already cited, or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems and utility systems.  Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work.  <BR><BR>Evaluation Criteria:  As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided to those offerors invited to participate in Phase II for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision.  Only that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order.  All other successful offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500.  The evaluation factors and their relative importance for both Phase I and Phase II of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows:  <BR><BR>Phase I:  Factor 1-1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 1-2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 1-3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE.

<DESC><p>The 30th Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) program at Vandenberg AFB, CA. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.
<p>The government is seeking to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential businesses capable of performing the type of work as described herein. The envisioned MACC program would consist of multiple, firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a broad range of maintenance, repair and new construction of buildings, facilities, or base infrastructure, performed under a design/build or just build process. In general, MACC program contractors would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Work may include full project design from a concept or performance-oriented statement of work. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is a must for projects under MACC. For the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI), the anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 / Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33,500,000. All interested parties are invited to respond and must be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov/).</p>
<p>The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that as many as ten (10) contracts could be awarded, each for a term consisting of one base year plus four, 1-year option periods. Task Orders written against MACC contracts are anticipated to range between $2,000 and $7,500,000. The overall program value is still under consideration; accordingly, at this point it is roughly anticipated to range between $100,000,000 and $200,000,000 over a five-year period.<br /><br />If your firm has an interest in proposing on future requirements as described above, please prepare and transmit a Capability Statement to Sharon May or David Hill via mail addressed to 30 CONS/LGCA, 1515 Iceland Ave, Bldg 8500, Room 150, Vandenberg AFB, CA 93437-5212, fax to (805) 606-5867, or email to sharon.may@vandenberg.af.mil and david.hill2@vandenberg.af.mil, not later than 4:00 PM PDT, 27 July 2009.

<CONTACT>Victor Wells, Phone 719-556-5021, Fax 719-556-9464, Email victor.wells@peterson.af.mil
<DESC>It is the Governments intent to award a 6 Month contract extension to the Consolidated Logistics Advisory &amp; Assistance Service Support, (CLASS) direct contract to support transition to follow-on contracts, to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) IAW Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1, Only one Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The CLASS contract provides services in support of the operation of systems supporting the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) mission. CLASS provides A&amp;AS to the Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Logistics Group (SMC/SLG) and related space organizations using Contractor Personnel resources through a single vehicle to optimize efficiencies for: Planning, programming, sustainment and implementation cycles, development of policy, decision making, management and administration, etc. Provide analysis/recommendations to Research and Development activities along with Engineering and technical advice. CLASS improves the effectiveness of management processes and/or procedures. CLASS support takes the form of advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training and technical support. CLASS improves the operation of systems supporting the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) mission. The SMC/SLG also requires CLASS support during several phases of planning, programming, sustainment, and implementation cycles of various government systems and complements the government's technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.</p>
<p>The current contract was awarded on 30 August 2007 with a base period of 31 Aug 07 to 31 Dec 07and 4 one calendar year options, 1 Jan 08 - 31 Dec 08, 1 Jan 09 - 31 Dec 09, 1 Jan 10 - 31 Dec 10 and 1 Jan 11 - 31 Dec 11, respectively. If all options were exercised the Period of Performance would have provided continued sustainment support through 31 Dec 2011 with an expected total contract value of $49.5M. Since then program workloads have increased substantially. This has resulted in increased reliance on the CLASS contractor to support the program offices with expertise and experienced personnel. The increase in support hours has caused the contract ceiling to run out ahead of schedule and with that the competitively awarded contract to SAIC has effectively ended. Based on projected mission and workload requirements, the program office projects a ceiling increase of the contract value by $15M for a total contract value of $64.5M will accommodate the completion of the residual work to 31 Dec 2010.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties were requested under a separate notice number FA882307R0000 dated 15 Jun 10 for initial acquisition planning for the CLASS follow-on.</p>

It is based on a strati&#64257;ed multistage sample design, and data are collected from each family in the survey sample using a face-to-face interview.
<p>Under a contractual relationship with NCHS that has existed since 1957, the U.S. Census Bureau plans and collects all NHIS data in accordance with NCHS specifications. NCHS is considering whether to contract with a private-sector survey research firm when implementing the next redesign in 2014. However, NCHS requires the necessary cost models and cost information to assess the feasibility of such a move and to assess the implications of various potential modifications to the NHIS sample design.</p>
<p>A solicitation for a firm fixed-price contract will be extended to MOBIS schedule holders. Interested vendors must be MOBIS schedule holders. The work to be completed under this contract is the first step in preparing for the next NHIS redesign, from both a statistical development and an acquisition planning standpoint. Because the successful completion of the tasks under this contract will assist NCHS in acquisition planning, the vendor for this work will not be permitted to submit a proposal for or serve in any role (as principal contractor or subcontractor at any level) on the NHIS data collection contract that may result from this research.</p>
<p>The research to be conducted must be completed within six months of contract award. Working collaboratively with NCHS to develop specifications, the vendor will conduct all the necessary activities to produce a series of reports that describe alternative sample designs, address the tradeoffs of each design relative to previous alternatives in terms of the precision of various estimates, and present cost models for each design. The vendor will first model the annual cost for a private-sector survey research firm to complete the NHIS in a manner consistent with the current NHIS design and the scope of work conducted by the Census Bureau. Then, working within three hypothetical data collection budgets, the vendor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Modify the current NHIS sample design to more reasonably reflect the capabilities, capacity, facilities, abilities, and limits of private-sector survey research firms;<br />&bull; Develop sample designs and cost models to permit reasonably precise direct state-level estimates on an annual basis for some states and to improve the ability to combine data across years to produce reasonably precise direct state-level estimates for all other states;<br />&bull; Develop sample designs and cost models to include the collection of saliva, buccal swabs, blood spots, height, and weight by lay interviewers or by specialists;<br />&bull; Develop sample designs and cost models that, to the extent possible, jointly and optimally improve state estimates and include biomeasures;<br />&bull; Create sample designs and cost models that improve state estimates, include biomeasures, and can be used as a sampling frame for NHANES.</p>
<p>Descriptions of the sample designs shall include all customary elements of a multistage design, including (but not limited to) the sampling frame, its coverage of the population, definition of sampling units, allocation of units across each stage of the design, ultimate cluster sizes for the smallest unit, stratification variables at any stage of the design, number of primary sampling units, and number of interviews. Cost models shall be comprehensive yet sufficiently flexible that NCHS can modify basic parameters (e.g., number of interviews, number of primary sampling units, interviewer wages) and get reasonable cost estimates.</p>
<p>General requirements for a successful vendor are: (1) familiarity with the NHIS, (2) knowledge of the statistical, methodological, and operational issues faced by large-scale stratified multistage household surveys, (3) experience developing sample designs for large-scale stratified multistate households surveys, and (4) experience building cost models and estimating the overall and component costs for face-to-face and telephone surveys.</p>
<p>All interested parties who are MOBIS schedule holders and who are capable of providing these services are invited to submit information that includes company name, address, contact name and telephone number, company literature, capability statement, experience, current Small Business size status, HUBZone certification from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and any other pertinent data. Responses SHALL NOT exceed 10 pages. All information submitted to CDC will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552).</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results. The knowledge obtained from information submitted will be factored into subsequent procurement set aside determinations and/or solicitation requirements. No award will be made based on this synopsis. The information received will be used in the Contracting Officer's assessment of capable sources.</p>
<p>Request for copies of a solicitation and/or telephone calls WILL NOT be honored or acknowledged. No cost or pricing data is requested. Responses submitted in electronic format are preferred, and must be submitted by 3:00 PM EST on Wednesday, June 30, 2010 to Natasha Rowland, Contracting Officer, at email nrowland@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  It is not a solicitation announcement or a request for proposals or quotes, and shall not obligate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to award a contract.  Requests for a solicitation will not be acknowledged.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to identify qualified contractors who can meet VA's requirements and to gather the information required to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing and must include (1) company name, (2) address, (3) point of contact, (3) phone, fax and email, (4) DUNS number, and (5) the content outlined below.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking sources to analyze and test the existing architecture and code for a Component Object Model (COM) and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) framework that hosts a functional prototype of a Brief Resident Supervision Index application (#236VHA/OI&T).

Background

VHA and VA's Office of Information and Technology sponsor an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen the innovative spirit among employees involved with medical information technology and to solicit their ideas for innovation.  From 6500 submissions, VA selected 26 for prototype development and evaluation, and for possible further development for VA-wide deployment.

The Brief Resident Supervision Index (BRSI) is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.  Approximately 36,000 resident physicians per year are currently supervised in the VA healthcare system.  These residents provide care to over 2.5 million Veteran patients.  The assessment of the clinical supervision of these residents is important to ensure the safety and quality of patient care.  However, VA currently uses chart reviews to assess these residents.  This method is labor intensive and expensive, contains limited data, represents a small sample of all patient encounters, does not provide timely results to identify and correct problems, reflects minimal standards of regulatory compliance, and does not incorporate VA electronic records at the point of care.  Furthermore, the system is limited to regulatory compliance and does not ensure optimal supervision, provide timely or easily accessible online results, account for case complexity, or show progress over time.

VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology.  This is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff.  VistA also includes links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.

This VHA Innovation project is to be based upon an existing Component Object Model (COM) framework for developing and delivering applications to users of the VA's Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS).  CPRS has the capability of being extended by means of COM modules. These are custom programs that enhance and extend the functionality of CPRS.  The VA Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHS) has developed a versatile and robust framework based upon CPRS's COM technology.  The VALLHS CPRS COM Object is a general-purpose CPRS extension that provides the ability to enhance CPRS now and in the future without deploying additional CPRS COM object dynamic link library (DLL) files to the workstations throughout the medical center.  The functionality of the COM object can be extended by writing server-side logic that processes client requests and returns content back to the COM object to be displayed to the CPRS user.

VALLHS developers have created a functioning prototype of the COM object-based Brief Resident Supervision Index, which is invoked at the time the residents electronically sign a progress note and when the attending staff cosigns the progress note.  The BRSI forms capture the manually entered supervision data and store it in a VistA table for easy access and analysis.

Requirements

VA intends to select the best solution for the technical analysis of the existing COM object framework and architecture.  The VA seeks an optimal hosting and network architecture solution for the COM object's JEE middleware that would sustain tens of thousands of users at 150 VA facilities nationwide.  The objective is to provide software and network engineering expertise in the system architecture, load balancing, testing, and ultimately installation and hosting of the LLVAHCS COM object client DLL and JEE middleware. 

Submission Content

Interested offerors are requested to submit an electronic response of no more than 10 pages, single spaced, 12 point font minimum.  The Government will not review any data in excess of 10 pages.  Submissions in response to the above requirements must include the following information:

3.  Teaming Arrangements - Describe the teaming partnerships or joint ventures your company would consider to perform the work.

4.  Commercial Availability - Describe the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available.  If it is necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, describe the impact on the commercial price, availability and the magnitude of the modification.

5.  Socioeconomic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint ventures have a Federal Socioeconomic status (e.g., Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Woman Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, HUBZone small business).  If SDVOSB or VOSB status applies, are your company and/or partners registered in VA's Veterans Online Business Registry (VetBiz)?

6.  Price Information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.

7.  Other Information - Provide any other relevant information that does not exceed the 10-page limit.

This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it limit the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  If a solicitation is issued, the Government will in no way be bound to information submitted in response to this notice.  Note that all offerors who provide goods or services to the Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) located at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Kipp &amp; Zonen USA Inc., 125 Wilbur Place, Bohemia, NY 11716 for a 2AP Sun Tracker 115230 VAC and shade ball assembly.
<p>The sole source determination is based on NOAA's market research showing that no other sources are able to meet the requirement for long-term performance related to durability and accuracy during continuous unattended operation and will provide statistically relevant intercomparibility data with NOAA's existing network. The tracker uses "active tracking" when the sun is out and an algorithm when the sun is not out. Active tracking cannot be trusted because the tracker can easily be "fooled" by atmospheric phenomenon such as silver linings and the quadrant sensor can get dirty. Tracking algorithms are good enough. This is the only supplier of a tracker that allows the tracking option to be set. Other suppliers cannot be modified and also only provide room for only two direct solar sensors (those that point directly at the sun). For climate monitoring, NOAA requires redundancy in that measurement plus room for a sun photometer. That requires three positions. The same goes for the shade platform. Two instruments need to be shaded (the diffuse pyranometer and the up-pointing pyrgeometer).</p>
<p>Delivery is required on or before 6 weeks after receipt of order (ARO).</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District intents to specify the following manufacturers product in the SOF Add/Alter 501B, MacDill AFB, FL project in order to properly manage the high density data center infrastructure required by USSOCOM-J6 in its new data center.  Corning Cable Systems LANscape Pretium EDGE product line specific components included optical trunks, harnesses, modules, housings, and jumpers.<BR><BR>This project will include the demolition of an existing facility.  Construct a multi-story facility (32,000sf) with pre-cast concrete exterior wall panels to match existing Building 501/501A architecture, reinforced concrete foundation on piles, concrete floor slab, structural steel framing, built-up roof, fire protection, assured telecommunication architecture, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, security systems and utilities.  Project includes loading dock and receiving area, landscaping, site improvements, demolition, communications infrastructure connecting to Building 501/501A complex and anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures.  Heating and cooling will be provided.  <BR><BR>USSOCOM has experienced unprecedented growth since September 11, 2001.  The USSOCOM compound is expanding into new buildings and is continually reorganizing.  The commands central and primary data center stores electronic data for and directs communications with USSOCOM headquarters as well as all components and units deployed operationally worldwide. This data center is being moved from a first floor location to a second floor location to aid in hurricane survivability and to provide space for increased capacity.  As such, the data center was incorporated into the project.  The building footprint is constrained and therefore the amount of floor space allotted to the data center, while sufficient for relocating the current equipment and limited growth, has an ultimate space limitation.<BR><BR>To mitigate the space constraint, hardware such as high density switching, blade server technology and storage array networks must be utilized.  The density of network connections to this equipment is astonishing, with over 700 connections available on a single network switch in one cabinet.  The Corning EDGE system product allows for 288 LC duplex connections in a 4 RMU (rack management unit) housing.  The associated series of fiber optic trunk cables and connection harnesses are also more flexible due to recent innovations in construction techniques.  This flexibility is paramount when routing connections to very densely connected equipment.  The 4 RMU housing has several unique features, including slide out trays, slide out modules within those trays, and an LC duplex connector that can be installed with one hand.  These features specifically lead to the ability to handle the 100% increase in connector density, when compared to traditional systems.  The trunk cable is a unique design and is smaller in diameter than comparable ribbon-type cables.  For example, a 144-strand Corning Pretium EDGE is 0.45.  The data center will have over 350 trunk cables and this reduced diameter will facilitate the installation and maintenance of the cables and of the cable tray support infrastructure.<BR><BR>This request is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. It is for information only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or announcement of a solicitation.  If no sources exist that can fully meet the requirements contained in this request (100%), then it is the Governments intent to specify Corning Panduit or Ortronics distribution components for use in the SOF Add/Alter 501B, MacDill AFB, FL. Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufacturers name, product data and written statement of compatibility. The written statement of compatibility shall include manufacturer backup information and support documentation.<BR><BR>The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. Costs to test and evaluate acceptable brines shall not be the responsibility of the Government. The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of publication of this notice.<BR><BR>Responses must be received fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice. Responses should be addressed to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, Attn: Kimberly Brackett: CESAM-CT-C, P.O.

The USSOCOM compound is expanding into new buildings, and is continually reorganizing and reconfiguring existing offices spaces.  This reorganization requires standardization of the communications infrastructure and supply components to provide reliable networks and telephone service to offices and cubicles. The compound is now divided between four component product lines.  There is a continuing battle to reduce this to the two product lines that have historically provided a sustained high level of service; Panduit and Ortronics.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) SEEKING 
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST TO ACQUIRE A SITE FOR 
CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL CEMETERY
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is interested in acquiring a site on which the Government may construct a VA national cemetery in the Omaha, Nebraska, region.  VA will consider either a land purchase, or acceptance of a donated site.  VA is looking for a parcel of two hundred (200) contiguous acres, or larger.
To be considered, the site must be within twenty-five (25) miles of the interchange of Interstate 80 and Interstate 680 (exit 446 on I-80) in Omaha, Nebraska.  In addition to proximity, the travel time via major highways will be a primary consideration.  VA has identified the following counties in the region as preferred locations:
Douglas, Sarpy and Saunders in Nebraska and Pottawattamie in Iowa.
Other requirements include:  1) Site ownership must be free and clear title that does not contain any encumbrances unacceptable to the Government.  2) Full disclosure of any hazardous or toxic wastes or materials on the site must be communicated to the Government in writing.  3) Easy access to the property via major roadways must currently exist or be planned for the immediate future.  4) Appropriate utility service and road access must presently exist or must be presently approved or planned by the appropriate jurisdiction(s).
VA staff will conduct a market survey of offered properties.  Interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) should submit one (1) copy of the information concerning the property, by mail, fax or e-mail no later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time on July 15, 2010 to the following:
Ed Swift	Telephone: 	202-461-8245
Real Property Service (00CFM3C)	Fax: 			202-565-4074
Department of Veteran Affairs	E-mail:	edward.swift@va.gov
810 Vermont Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20420
The Government will pay no more than the appraised fair market value for the site.
RESPONDENTS ARE ADVISED THAT THE VA ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY TO PURCHASE A SITE BASED UPON REPONSES TO THIS ADVERTISEMENT.

<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for an online Patient Health Risk Assessment(HRA) Integrated with the Veterans Health Administration's Electronic Medical Record and Personal Health Record. 
Background
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  is seeking sources to provide information to inform the acquisition and integration of an online Health Risk Assessment tool for use by patients and clinicians within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  Healthcare services are provided by VHA to approximately 5.5 million Veterans at 154 hospitals, 800 Community-based Outpatient Clinics and additional psychiatric facilities, community living centers, Veteran centers, research facilities, rehabilitation facilities throughout the US.   Comprehensive health care is provided through primary, tertiary, and long-term care in the areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics, spinal cord injury, women's health and extended care.  The VHA currently uses a decentralized electronic medical record (EMR) system within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and is in the process of developing the next generation EMR called "HealtheVet".  The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is the graphical user interface through which VA clinicians access an individual's electronic medical record within VistA.  Further, the VHA currently has an online Personal Health Record available to Veterans that is accessed through "My HealtheVet" (www.myhealth.va.gov ), an online environment where veterans, family, and clinicians come together to optimize veterans' health care.  It provides trusted information, online services, limited health record access, and messaging between veterans and clinicians.  
The VHA is seeking information to plan for a future acquisition of a patient self-administered Health Risk Assessment application integrated with the VHA's Personal Health Record and Electronic Medical Record.  Health Risk Assessments (HRA) are instruments that collect information from individuals through the use of structured questionnaires. HRAs determine risk status via validated algorithms or decision rules and provide tailored feedback to the individual about his or her health status, with specific recommended steps to improve health. Core features of an HRA include assessment of personal information, past medical and surgical history, medications, family history, health behaviors (use of tobacco, alcohol, diet, physical activity, etc.), and receipt of preventive care (screenings and immunizations, etc.).  Elements also desirable include information on self- management for common chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, health risks relevant to the elderly, and readiness-to-change for health behaviors that increase patient risk for disease and/or injury.  The VHA is also interested in assessing issues relevant to combat Veterans, such as military-related exposures, trauma, or sequelae related to military experience.
The Government is open to considering teaming and prime/subcontractor relationships for this effort. The period of performance is anticipated to begin in Fall 2010. The contract period of performance is one (1) years from date of award with an additional four (4) option years. The Government anticipates a Firm Fixed Price Contract. However, in the event VA proceeds to a formal request for proposals, VA reserves the right to consider alternative engagement models that lower fixed cost but include incentive payments for superior quality, productivity, or expanded scope.  Moreover, VA will welcome both conventional "system delivery and integration" models as well as "software as a service" or similarly structured leasing proposals.
This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process. 
Requirements
Respondents shall provide a general capabilities statement and rough order of magnitude cost estimates to address the requirements enumerated below. Based on an initial review of the statement submitted, respondents may be asked to provide additional information. 
1.	Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available  and describe the clinical/health content and features of your HRA application, including a brief description of the clinical domains included, risk algorithms and/or decision rules, and a description of the user's tailored feedback report.  
2.	Describe the capability for modifying your existing HRA application (i.e., question set, risk algorithms and decision rules, user's tailored feedback report), as well as adding new question items/logic/algorithms and content in user feedback report for the VHA user population.  Describe the process, level of effort required to make such modifications and provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate.  For estimating purposes, assume modifications to 15% of your current HRA application, the addition of 15% more questions, risk algorithms, and content to the user's tailored feedback report. 
3.	State whether your HRA application is integrated into any current Electronic Medical Record or Personal Health Record, and if so provide a description of the level of effort and ROM cost estimate for that integration. Describe any teaming arrangements that your company would need to consider to perform the work associated with integrating your HRA application with the VHA's Electronic Medical Record and Personal Health Record.
4.	Describe if your HRA application is compliant with Section 508 requirements (http://www.section508.gov/) and requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). If your application is not compliant, please estimate the effort and a ROM cost estimate to make the application compliant.
5.	Describe whether your application uses interoperability standards recognized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including interoperability with the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN). (http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&mode=2&cached=true&objID=1142) If not, describe the level of effort and a ROM cost estimate for making modifications to use such standards.
6.	Describe whether or not your application is able to meet current VA Security requirements detailed in VA Handbook 6500 Contract Security (including all appendices ) http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=471&FType=2  If not, provide a ROM cost estimate for making modifications for compliance with all VA requirements. 
7.	Describe the platforms, portals, and or other venues where your HRA application is currently deployed.  Include information for the government to be able to evaluate size/scale of the deployed application, for example, number of clients using hosted application, number of HRA application users (average over one week, max load capacity, etc), number of servers and or other hardware requirements. Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
8.	Describe hosting options, including options for client (government) hosting of hardware, software, or both and include rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs for the various hosting/purchase/lease/license/subscription options.  Suggest a recommended pricing structure.  Use the following assumptions for your ROM estimates.  Base year:  500 unique users (field testing), Year 1:  20,000 unique users (initial implementation), Year 2 : 100,000 unique users, Year 3: 500,000 unique users, Year 4: 1,000,000 unique users, Year 5: 1,500,000 unique users.  
9.	Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 20 page limitation.

<a href="mailto:julia.wertleyrotenberry@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Durham (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Military applications of biometric exploitation, to date, have largely focused on the use of fingerprints to identify personnel for entry into controlled areas. Biometrics, however, has an expanded role in military operations to include: combat identification (friend, foe, or neutral); offensive operations (intelligence support to targeting); force protection (base access); detention operations; civil-military operations (track target members of a population); and personnel recovery and identification. In addition, biometrics can be utilized to improve business functions such as physical and logical access controls and privilege management applications like health care benefits, finance, and time reporting. As a result of the expanding application space of biometrics in the military and the maturity of biometrics technologies within the Department of Defense (DoD), the requirements and needs of the user are becoming increasingly complex and require specific solutions that have not yet been developed. It is DoDs intent to advance the state-of-the-art across the spectrum of the biometrics infrastructure to provide users with new and enhanced biometrics capabilities.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Contracting Center, Research Triangle Park Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), DoDs Biometrics Identity Management Agency (BIMA), and the Defense Biometrics Office, is soliciting white papers focused on the development and demonstration of biometric functionality across the four (4) Focus Areas (indicated below) under topic area 2.63 Technology Demonstrations and Assessments for Department of Defense Biometrics through the Army Research Laboratory and Army Research Office Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number W911NF-07-R-0001-04 effective from Fiscal Year 2007 through Fiscal Year 2011.<BR><BR>Research and Development solutions are sought for:<BR><BR>a. Tactical Collection Systems: The ability to sense and collect biometric data is critical to the overall biometrics process. The DoDs Tactical Collection Systems include the capability to obtain biometric data as well as all related biographical and/or situational data. One goal is to provide this capability with a smaller, lighter, and more resilient device. Advances also can include not just sensors, but systems that take a different approach to the methods of collection in biometric modalities. Below are two Focus Areas of Tactical Collection Systems that should be addressed:<BR><BR>"	Expanded Rolled Print Capabilities  Increased capability in mobile devices to improve rolled print collection in the field. Improvements could include higher quality of the captured prints, increased speed of collection, decreased cost of the device, etc. Example solutions could be: Non-contact fingerprint imaging hardware, increase platens size, or other techniques.<BR>"	Faster Iris Captures Capabilities - Expedite the speed at which devices can collect and process iris images. The means to capture subjects in a less-than-ideal situation due to natural environmental aspects, constrained time for collections, or safe distance considerations is an important influence in technology development.<BR> <BR>b. Enterprise-wide Capability Enhancement: A large portion of advancements in the biometric field focus on the forward portion of current military biometric operations in that they only advance collection methods. The Enterprise-wide Capability Enhancement topic includes the ability to use the collected biometrics by making efficient use of processing, cataloguing, storing, matching and sharing of that data.  The enterprise strives for advances in universal data ingestion, database management, and matching techniques. Below are two Focus Areas of the Enterprise-wide Capability Enhancement challenges that should be addressed:<BR><BR>"	Latent Print Modality - Matching algorithm capabilities for collected latent prints whether on-site with limited processing power available or at a central database that users connect to. The solutions could be derived from sensor technology advances, collection, processing methods, and/or other means.<BR>"	Future Modality Support - Improved DNA, Voice, and Palm processing methods. The Palm modality is described as including the full palm as well as the Thenar, Hypothenar, Interdigital, and Writers regions. Currently these modalities are constrained in their ability compared to the dominant modality types of finger, face, and iris. Advances in new modalities and their related sensors, processing techniques, and matching capability are needed. With new modalities, challenges in biometric database management, such as discovery, synchronization, and optimizations occur and can also be addressed.<BR><BR>Offerors are invited to submit a white paper not to exceed five (5) pages under the topic area referenced above and shall be sent via email to Dr. Keith Aliberti (email: keith.aliberti@us.army.mil) by 9 July 2010.  Each white paper must be submitted with a single PowerPoint chart, in landscape mode, divided into four equal quadrants. The upper left quadrant shall contain a graphic representing the approach or product described in the white paper.  The upper right quadrant shall contain a brief description of the approach and the expected product described in the white paper.  The lower left quadrant shall contain a schedule of major milestones for the proposed effort as described in the White Paper.  The lower right quadrant shall contain estimated proposed cost for each major milestone as described in the white paper.  Use no smaller than 18 point Arial font.  This chart will not count against the white paper page count.<BR><BR>The Government will evaluate all white papers and provide a written response/proposal invitation to the offerors on or about 30 July 2010. Up to seven awards valued at ~$750,000 each are expected. Accepted proposals should lead to a tangible demonstration within 18 months.  Demonstrations and assessments will be performed in coordination with ARL and BIMA. Results are to include technical performance measurements and analysis from actual test beds and laboratory environments that indicate the effectiveness of the technology to advance the state-of-the-art in current biometrics capabilities across and/or within the above reference focused areas.<BR><BR>Any questions concerning the award(s) process shall be directed to: Julia Wertley-Rotenberry by email: julia.wertleyrotenberry@us.army.mil.  This special notice expires 9 July 2010 at 12:00 PM (EST).

<DESC><p>The DOC NOAA NCEP Operational (OPS) and Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) High Performance Computing Systems (HPCS)<br />Request for Information (RFI) RFI-NCEP2009</p>
<p><br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) anticipates acquiring advanced high performance computing systems (HPCS) to meet its operational and research and development computing requirements.  This requirement includes the possibility of accommodating unanticipated additional internal NOAA HPC requirements as well as external partner agency's weather related HPC needs.  The new Operational Centralized Computing System (OCCS) will replace or augment the current Operational and the Research and Development HPCS platforms at the National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) headquartered in Camp Springs, Maryland.  The new replacement systems will be known as the OCCS (operational environment) and the O-R&amp;D (research and development) HPCS and will provide primary resources needed to carry out NOAA's operational and research missions.  One of the primary objectives of the acquisition is to have the same technical configuration, i.e., HW, operating systems, etc. for both the OCCS and O-R&amp;D HPCS.  NOAA requires the vendor to provide a complete and fully integrated system solution.  This requirement facilitates and accelerates the process of transitioning codes developed in the O-R&amp;D environment to running as part of NCEP's production or operational suite of products.</p>
<p>Increased computational power is essential for NOAA to meet its strategic goals related to weather, climate, air quality, coastal and ocean resource management, and national commerce support, thereby providing improved service to the public.  NOAA anticipates contract award and initial system delivery in early FY2011.  An OCCS/O-R&amp;D HPCS Acquisition Team ("the Team") has been formed within the Department of Commerce. The RFI documents which describe this project are being made available via the Internet at the Project Web Site, http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/ccs.  Interested parties should continue to monitor this web site for additional information concerning this project.</p>
<p>NOAA is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to obtain the needed computing systems within the time frame and requirements. The RFI documents are intended to provide the high-performance computer industry with a general overview of the requirements and time frames, as well as to open a formal communication channel between industry and the Team.  The Team has provided a draft Statement of Need (SON) on the Project Web Site, including information on how to obtain initial benchmark codes.  The Team welcomes industry comments, questions and suggestions that will aid it in developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the SON.</p>
<p>The projected budget for this acquisition is shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Projected Budget By Fiscal Year ($M)<br />(subject to availability of funds) <br /> 2011	2012	2013	2014	2015	2016	2017	2018	2019<br />Equipment and Maintenance (Base)	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M</p>
<p>The Team will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop the SON and the Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Team does not anticipate the need for a pre-proposal conference, but if one is deemed necessary, information will be posted on the Project Web Site accordingly.</p>
<p>The Team may conduct one-on-one communications with interested vendors in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Parties interested in providing information that the Team may use in developing the Government's technical or acquisition approach should review carefully the draft Statement of Need and supporting documents referenced in the draft Statement of Need, all of which are available at the Project Web Site.<br /> <br />One of the purposes of this RFI is to provide vendors with initial benchmark codes that will give an indication of the type of model programs that may be expected to run on both of NOAA's new OCCS and O-R&amp;D HPCS.  A complete list of the major model programs and the proposed schedule is available at the Project Web Site.  Instructions for obtaining the benchmark codes are available at the Project Web Site. The Team requests that vendors submit their benchmark test results with their RFI response.  This will give NOAA an indication of the performance capabilities of each vendor's recommended computing resources.  One of the principal outcomes of vendor/government dialog will be to ensure that viable approaches are considered during the competition.  The Government may therefore utilize the information provided to refine its acquisition strategy to maximize competition among viable acquisition alternatives.</p>
<p>It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public.  The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the SON, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.&nbsp; Proprietary information should be marked as such.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics. Recommended page lengths are identified in parentheses at the end of each question.  Total response to this RFI should be limited to 20 pages, which provides flexibility to extend some answers beyond the recommended length, if needed.  Vendors who submit written responses may be invited to augment their written responses with a 2-3 hour oral presentation in early 2009.  Vendors responding to this RFI and who are interested in making a presentation to the Team, please notify the Contracting Support Office, Mr. Richard Parkerson, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at richard.parkerson@noaa.gov by 15 December 2008.  The Team will make a decision on which vendors to invite to make presentations.  Please address the following questions and concerns in the RFI submission:</p>
<p>1. Keep in mind that NOAA is looking to acquire a &lsquo;complete and fully integrated' system solution, i.e., a complete package which describes the Vendor's ability to provide this complete system solution.  Briefly describe the involvement Vendor's organization has had in providing HPC systems to Vendor's customers.  Has Vendor's HPC involvement included weather/climate applications? Describe relationships Vendor has or has had with particular HPC, storage, communications, software, and facilities providers in support of Vendor's HPC involvement.  Any references Vendor can provide would be appreciated. (1 page)<br /> <br /> 2. Describe Vendor organization's ability to provide engineering support to NOAA HPC users in the Washington, DC and Fairmont, WV areas. (1/2 page)<br /> <br /> 3. Describe any anticipated HPC technology developments (i.e. compute, storage, network) that NOAA should be aware of to ensure that our SON elicits the best responses from the vendor community.  Has Vendor's organization had a role in HPC Grid applications? (1 page)<br /> <br /> 4. Describe the largest file size Vendor's system can handle now, whether this is a hardware or software limitation and projections for the largest file size during the base and option periods of performance.  Describe any alternatives solutions to maximize file size and trade-offs compared with other solutions.  Describe the largest number of nodes Vendor's filesystem can handle now and projections for the base and option periods of performance. Describe any alternatives solutions to maximize node number and trade-offs compared with other solutions. (1 page)<br /> <br /> 5. The user profiles as identified in the SON show the majority of users located in 2 geographic areas with some additional remote users.  How would configurations comprising 1 or 2 locations affect Vendor's system design and network bandwidth requirements?  Identify the magnitude of any cost impact that could be expected in any given configuration. Additionally, describe the Vendor's approach to user management including local and remote access.  Does it include token management, 2-factor authentication and is it compliant with current federal laws policies and guidelines? (1 page)<br /> <br /> 6. What facilities will the Vendor propose to house the entire suite of equipment expected as a result of this procurement and what are the challenges associated with providing the facilities?  Vendor should describe their ability to evaluate such alternatives including the support and high bandwidth communications requirements. (1 page)<br /> <br /> 7. Based upon Vendor's knowledge of NOAA's current Operational (OCCS) and Research and Development (O-R&amp;D) procedures and configurations, are there technologies, available now and over the course of the contract period (thru 2020), that would enable NOAA to better integrate its operational and R&amp;D environments in such areas as: job scheduling, programming environment, data management, transitioning models from R&amp;D to operations, high levels of IT security protection? (1 page)<br /> <br /> 8. NOAA plans to include options to augment the OCCS and O-R&amp;D HPCS with incremental computational increases based on projected future requirements.  What would be Vendor organization's ability and approach to responding to unanticipated requirements throughout the course of the contract?  What would be the best way to include these requirements in the RFP to enable Vendor's company develop a response? (1/2 page)<br /> <br /> 9. What issues does Vendor have with respect to the individual benchmark applications NOAA has chosen for this procurement?  Does Vendor have any concerns about the approach including the number or the variety of benchmark applications? (1 page)<br /> <br /> 10. Does the SON make it clear that one of the major goals of the acquisition is to optimize the throughput of each benchmark? (1/2 page)<br /> <br /> 11. NOAA plans on issuing a performance-based contract for the OCCS and O-R&amp;D HPCS.  Describe any performance measures/incentives that Vendor would recommend that NOAA incorporate into the contract. (1/2 page)<br /> <br /> 12. What questions, recommendations or needs for additional information does Vendor's firm have in response to this RFI and draft SON that would help the Government prepare an RFP that Vendor's firm will be able to respond to effectively? (1 page)</p>
<p>The vendor's submission should reflect an understanding of NOAA's requirements for product delivery and an overall approach for providing the required capabilities.  Multiple or alternative approaches are welcome.  Although this RFI requests specific information, it is not intended to discourage innovative thinking on the part of industry to propose alternative solutions or approaches that the Team may not have considered.</p>
<p>Vendor responses should identify a point-of-contact including the representative's name, company, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number both in an e-mail and within the body of the submitted document.</p>
<p>Benchmark results should be summarized according to the instructions included with the benchmark suite of applications. The benchmark instructions are available at http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/ccs.  The benchmark codes can be accessed on the same website.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with NEPTUNE AND COMPANY, INCORPORATED, 1505 15TH STREET STE B, LOS ALAMOS, NM 87544-3000 to provide programming language, "R" program code and output for Yukon Charlie/Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve, Fairbanks, AK 99709. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background:  The products that are being requested are highly specialized.  Neptune is the only company that specializes in this type of modeling using ALFRESCO software. A system is in place for researchers to analyze fire patterns and compatibility is critical for the integrity of the data. 
1.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Input and output must be perfectly matched to unique software and its specifications.  ALFRESCO modeling program was specifically designed interior Alaska applications rather than other software applications that have been developed for the very different ecosystems of the Lower 48 states.
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.There are exact specifications that must be met to satisfy requirements of the modeling effort.  Neptune, Inc will provide the programming language, "R" program code and output, and modifications made to adapt software to the tundra ecosystems unique to northwest Alaska.  A report will document the work that the company has provided.
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).  Neptune is the only company that works with this software and has intimate knowledge of its workings to produce acceptable products in an efficient manner.  Other fire modeling software is based on ecosystems present in the Lower 48.  This work will provide a foundation that will build upon it using ALFRESCO.
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  The unique software used to model fire on the landscape of Alaska is not used by other vendors.  Future NPS work, based on the modeling developed here, will be undertaken using ALFRESCO.
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   No
6. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  N/A

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, Sioux Falls, SD, intends to negotiate solely with GE Healthcare for an Apex Pro Wireless Medical Telemetry Antenna System.  Only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) General Electric Apex Pro system components can be utilized in this installation due to the nature of potential interference to medical equipment monitoring systems and compatibility with the existing antenna system.  To accomplish this will require a complete new antenna system to be installed in a ward below the current system and the two systems must be connected together at an existing General Electric Apex Pro telemetry server.  Work will consist of complete design and installation of a General Electric Apex Pro telemetry antenna system and all cable, filters, splitters, amplifiers, power supplies, splitter boards, wire pulling, installations, terminations and antenna mounting must be provided by and completed by the vendor. Removal of old abandoned telemetry antennas as needed and dust containment procedures will be necessary as the area involved is occupied by patients in the facility. Complete testing and certification by a General Electric trained and certified field service engineer will be required after the installation is complete. Successful installation will include verification of immunity to HD TV signals using filters as necessary, adequate range testing and overall performance will be required. Tests must be conducted using certified and NIST traceable test equipment. Any proprietary General Electric software keys/upgrades, etc that may be necessary to configure the telemetry system for the expanded coverage must be provided by the trained and certified General Electric field service engineer doing this installation. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 54519 and the size standard is $23.0 million. The award will be issued as a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract. 

This notice is not a request for quotations. No solicitation will be issued and proposals will not be accepted.  However, any business that believes it can meet these requirements and possesses the financial capacity with relevant past experience and expertise may give written notice to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days from this noticeâs publication date.

Offeror's prices will be evaluated on a best value basis.<br />Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.<br />The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<br />Funding for this requirement is under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The below Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause is applicable.<br />FAR 52.204-11 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Reporting Requirements. <br />As prescribed in 4.1502, insert the following clause: <br />AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT-REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- <br />"Contract", as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. <br />"First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. <br />"Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): <br />(1) Salary and bonus. <br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. <br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. <br />(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. <br />(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. <br />(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. <br />(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. <br />(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. <br />(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov. <br />(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. <br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government's on-line reporting tool. <br />(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. <br />(4) Program or project title, if any. <br />(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. <br />(6) An assessment of the contractor's progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. <br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide- <br />(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and <br />(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. <br />(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if- <br />(i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received- <br />(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. <br />(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act. The contractor shall provide detailed information on these first-tier subcontracts as follows: <br />(i) Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor receiving the award and for the subcontractor's parent company, if the subcontractor has a parent company. <br />(ii) Name of the subcontractor. <br />(iii) Amount of the subcontract award. <br />(iv) Date of the subcontract award. <br />(v) The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. <br />(vi) Funding agency. <br />(vii) A description of the products or services (including construction) being provided under the subcontract, including the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the subcontract. <br />(viii) Subcontract number (the contract number assigned by the prime contractor). <br />(ix) Subcontractor's physical address including street address, city, state, and country.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide parts that satisfy all form, fit and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard's HH-65 aircraft. <br /><br />The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the salient characteristics of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the salient characteristics is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 8 JULY 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 12 JULY 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200148 in subject line.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 23 MAY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 23 MAY 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>The clause at FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (Mar 2009) ADDENDUM</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK:<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: <br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3)other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management<br />Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling <br />Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance <br />Contract Administration<br />Security <br />Testing</p>
<p>(b)The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c)The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

Such offer may not necessarily bethe proposal offering the lowest cost or receiving the highest technical rating.(b) Proposals will be rated and ranked on the evaluation factors listed below.It should be noted that cost is not a numerically weighted factor.  Althoughtechnical factors are significantly more important than cost, cost is animportantfactor and should be considered when preparing responsive proposals. Theimportance of cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree ofequality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.Whenthe offerors within the competitive range are considered essentially equal interms of technical capability, or when cost is so significantly high as todiminishthe value of the technical superiority to the government, cost may become thedetermining factor for award.  In summary, cost/technical trade-offs will bemade, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governedonly by the tests of rationality and consistency with the establishedevaluationfactors.Factor 1 and Factor 2 are of equal importance and are more importantindividually than Factor 3.Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS.10.  Offerors shall include in their proposal a completed copy of the provisionat 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items,with its offer.  A copy of 52.212-3 is included as Attachment 2 to thissolicitation.11.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- CommercialItems, applies to this acquisition and is included in this solicitation..12. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required ToImplement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to thisacquisition.  Additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are included as anattachment to this solicitation.13.  Additional Information:The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) may be accessed at:http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.Offerors shall submit a price for each CLIN in paragraph  5 above based on thenine milestones described in paragraph 7 above.L-324  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSALS(a) The technical proposal shall cover your understanding of the work and yourme

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ] , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are / are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a) Definitions.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) 0 Are, 0 are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) 0 Are, 0 are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<CONTACT>Katy Day, Contract Specialist, Phone 661-277-8216, Email kathrin.day@edwards.af.mil
<DESC>1. Industry Day is scheduled for an upcoming BAA titled <strong>"Liquid Rocket Engine Technology Development (LRETD)"</strong> on Wednesday, 30 June 2010. This BAA will include three (3) topics:
<p>A. <strong>Green Advanced Spacecraft Propulsion (Green ASP)</strong> - AFRL's object of this program is to develop a thruster that will accommodate increased temperature and oxidation product environments to deliver predictable performance. Associated life and delivered thrust scaling as well as degradation algorithms are sought to support predictability of performance. AFRL is pursuing increased delivered energy density, decreased toxicity spacecraft chemical propulsion to support development and deployment of smaller logistical footprint, more easily deployable and mission capable spacecraft. AFRL has developed increased energy density, decreased toxicity monopropellant formulations relative to the current state of the art; however, the combustion environments are more demanding than state of the art propellants due to the increase in combustion temperature and oxidative product formation. Correspondingly, thruster component temperature and oxidation resistance requirements have increased relative to the state of the art as well. Thruster development to date, specific to AFRL developed advanced monopropellant formulations, has emphasized catalytic ignition. Development work has been focused upon a specific AFRL-developed monopropellant formulation applied to thruster design and support system (tanks, valves, regulators, control components, etc.) primarily for satellite missions. The desired conclusion of this program is a relevant demonstration of flight-like optimized components and of relevant mission duty cycles that support a flight-weight propulsion system design with defined performance and lifetime attributes. To achieve this end, the program design will rely on a phased approach 1) to understand thruster component materials requirements defined by combustion environment, degradation behavior, etc., and initialize algorithms describing these, 2) to map out delivered performance in a basic thruster configuration and derive initial scaling and degradition algorithms there from, 3) to optimize light-weight thruster development, to test performance and to validate developed algorithms, 4) and to demonstrate program performance goals and design for a proto-flight propulsion unit with supporting data analysis.</p>
<p>B. <strong>Health Assessment and Recognition Tools (HART)</strong> - The purpose of this topic is to solicit proposals for the development of innovative technologies in the field of liquid rocket engine health management. More specifically, the purpose of this topic is to develop sensors and sensor data algorithms that will enable oxygen-rich staged-combustion cycle reusable booster engines to achieve the Air Force operability goal for engine turnaround time. Solutions of particular interest include those that reduce or eliminate time-consuming ground inspections and/or maintenance actions. This topic has two (2) areas of interest; Turbopump Assembly (TPA) Application and Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA) Application.</p>
<p><br />C. <strong>Propulsion Unit for Cubesats (PUC)</strong> - Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB is interested in developing a propulsion module for precision maneuvering of very small spacecraft. Spacecraft typified by the emerging "cubesat" standard may provide a new paradigm for responsive spacecraft. Spacecraft with stowed volumes of between 1,000 cm3 and 3,000 cm3 massing approximately 3 kg for a variety of missions are advantageous for a variety of Air Force missions. One significant drawback of present cubesat technology is the lack of capable primary propulsion. Recent analysis performed at AFRL has determined that it is possible to increase total impulse capability dramatically over current state-of-the-art while remaining within a 1,000 cm3 envelope.

1.	Will the existing areas/spaces of Building 24 be required to be brought into compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and the Barrier Free Design Guide?  In addition will any existing exterior improvements such as walkways, ramps and/or stairs be required to be brought into compliance with these standards? Compliance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS http://www.access-board.gov/ufas-html/ufas.htm) and the VA Barrier Free Design Guide Supplement.  These will be included in the design.

2.	Will the existing areas/spaces of Building 24 be required to be brought into compliance with NPFA 101, and other NFPA Fire Codes as referenced in VHA Program Guide PG-18-3?  Specifically will the existing fire sprinkler system and fire alarm system currently installed be required to be up-graded should they be found to be non-compliant? Yes

3.	Will Building 24 be subjected to the requirements of the VA's Physical Security Design Manual: Mission Critical Facilities? Or will security requirements directed towards the current security systems in place at Building 24? Building 24 is not considered a mission critical building and will not be held to the requirements of VA's Physical Security Design Manual: Mission Critical Facilities. Building 24 will be subjected to the requirements of the Physical Security Design Manual: Life Safety Protected Facilities. 

4.	Who are the structural engineers familiar with the Fresno Campus that have been involved with successful projects in the past?  There are no specific structural engineers that we can/will recommend.  We have not been able to determine what firm did the structural drawings, and in what year.

5.	Who are the other engineers and/or specialists that you work with regularly (civil, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical, fire life safety, etc)?  There are no specific engineers or specialists that we can/will recommend.

6.	Would it be possible for us to speak with Travis Horn before submitting our proposal?  If so, could you please provide his contact information?  The only way to get information prior to the proposal due date is through the contracting officer.

8.	"Clinical research space" is listed in the solicitation.  Is it clinical space where patients are seen, laboratory "bench" space with sinks and equipment, general office space or some combination? All new spaces are considered non-patient care areas. The VA expects that the majority of the space is developed as offices/conference space. 

9.	Does the 150 mile geographic restriction apply to our proposed sub-consultants?  The 150 mile geographic restriction applies to the prime contractor only.

<DESC>Introduction
This announcement constitutes the annual posting of BAA, HQ0147-09-ATI-BAA as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016(c).  The original announcement language is included below. 

Original Posted Information
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack.  The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  Technical advancement is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Director, Advanced Technology (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS.  This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.

MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Program to identify and develop innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  ATI is a competitive, science and technology research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."

The MDA contracts with private industry, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research in those areas covered in this BAA.  Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract.  MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards, however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Mr. Robert Barnes, MDA/DV; 256-450-2032, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a concept paper or proposal in response to this BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.  Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contracts are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2009 through FY 2010.

DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.

The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict.  Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  

The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e).  The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows: 

EVALUATION FACTORS 
MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation: 

(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; 
(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; 
(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; 
(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; 
(5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and

Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.

The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offerors proposal:

(1)  The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; 
(2)  The offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and 
(3)  The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk;  
(4)  Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.  

No further evaluation criteria will be used.  The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of ATD for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until February 25, 2011 and will be reposted in 2010.  Submittals will be accepted on a continual basis throughout the entire period of time the BAA is open.  

Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).  


Mr. Robert Barnes, MDA/DV; phone: 256-450-2032 has been assigned as the MDA technical point of contact for the HQ0147-09-ATI-BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission is encouraged and allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.

<DESC>Q&amp;A
<p>Q: Is there an incumbent developer/manufacturer of a MV-22 Cabin Part Task Trainer? Has another company produced other MV-22 part task trainers? If so who?</p>
<p>A: There is not an incumbent developer of a MV-22 Cabin Part Task trainer. A CV-22 cabin Part Task Trainer was developed by Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office; however, there has never been an MV-22 Cabin Part Task trainer developed. This is the first one. The mission requirements and the users between the MV and CV versions are different.</p>
<p>Q: Is there an incumbent developer/manufacturer of a MV-22 Cabin Part Task Trainer? Has another company produced other MV-22 part task trainers for any US Military service? If so who?</p>
<p>A: The MV-22 CPTT has never been developed. A CV-22 CPTT was developed by Bell-Boeing Joint Project Office. Different missions and different users which is why the MV and the CV are unique; however, they are similar in that they share the same common airframe.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), is requesting information, seeking sources, and conducting market research for Next-Generation Checked Baggage Explosives Detection Systems (EDS) to serve as a primary screening device of airline passenger checked baggage. TSA invites vendors of EDS and other interested parties to voluntarily provide information on capabilities of detection technologies that currently exist in market-ready bulk explosives detection systems. The market-ready systems must provide detection performance in accordance with TSA Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) Requirements for Automated Detection of Explosives. The TSA is interested in pursuing EDS that can comply with one or more of the following baggage screening throughput requirements: a. High-Speed EDS &ndash; Meets the TSA&rsquo;s Checked Baggage Detection standard while screening bags at a rate of 900 or more bags per hour (bph). This system will be procured in the High Speed Fully-Integrated Inline configuration. b. Medium-Speed EDS &ndash; Meets the TSA&rsquo;s Checked Baggage Detection standard while screening bags at a rate between 400 and 900 bags per hour (bph). This system will be procured in the Medium Speed Fully-Integrated Inline configuration. c. Reduced-Size EDS &ndash; Meets the TSA&rsquo;s Checked Baggage Detection standard while screening bags at a rate between 100 and 400 bags per hour (bph) and has a system size no larger than 26 ft x 6 ft x 6 ft (LxWxH). This system will be procured in the Stand-Alone, Partially-Integrated Inline, and Fully-Integrated Inline configurations. The TSA requires that Partially-Integrated Inline and Fully-Integrated Inline EDS be capable of operation in a networked configuration allowing communication between scanners and peripheral components. PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION.

****************** AMENDMENT 1: The due date for written responses to the RFI is hereby extended. Written responses are due by 4:30pm on Friday, June 26, 2009, to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov.

***************** AMENDMENT 2: Technical questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted by 2pm on Tuesday, June 23, 2009, to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov. Questions shall not contain classified information.

**************** AMENDMENT 3: The following documents are available upon submission of a written request to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov: 1. DHS 4300A V6.1.1 2. DHS Linux Secure Baseline Configuration V2.1 3. DHS Windows 2003 Server Windows XP Windows Vista Secure Baseline Configuration Guide V1.2

***************** AMENDMENT 4: The attached Excel document contains the questions and answers between TSA and vendor participants during Session 1 of Industry Day held on Tuesday, June 16, 2009.

***************** AMENDMENT 5: The purpose of Amendment 5 to HSTS04-09-R-ST2180 is for Explosive Detection Systems data distribution and collection purposes. Attached, entitled "Amendment 5 - HSTS04-09-R-ST2180 - Letter to Vendors," provides details and instructions for distribution and data collection. All information exchange must occur no later than August 9, 2009, via email to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov. Note that TSA's intent to share new detection standards information and collect information from industry is for market research purposes only. Therefore, TSA is not responsible for any development expenses resulting from this RFI. Vendors are fully responsible for costs incurred in the response to this request. Collected data will not be utilized to evaluate any potential offerors' capabilities in regards to any potential awards.

**** Amendment 12*****<br />The purpose of this amendment is to update vendors on the status of the testing program. TSA has revised the CRT-QMP which will include changes to the schedule.
<p>Below is a list of major changes to the program:<br />1) There will be an additional opening for CRT-QDP submittal. Vendors who have already received a favorable assessment of a CRT-QDP package do not need to resubmit a package for the current configuration. <br />2) There will be three testing windows available for vendors to pass certification within this testing cycle.<br />3) Vendors who have received a favorable assessment of the CRT-QDP will be permitted to participate in Full Threat Weight (FTW) data collection. <br />4) TSA has added additional time in the schedule to allow vendors to use the FTW data for further algorithm development.<br />5) The Schedule of the CRT-QMP (located Appendix A) is a dynamic document; this document will be updated as needed. An updated schedule will be provided to registered vendors as needed.<br />a. Below is a summary of Revised major milestones:</p>
<p>Significant Milestones (Tentative; subject to change)<br />Completion of Window 1 Cert Testing December 21, 2010<br />Opening of Second Window Testing November 3, 2010<br />Completion of Window 2 Cert Testing February 3, 2011<br />Estimated Completion of Window 1 QPL April 29, 2011<br />Estimated completion of Window 2 QPL July 8, 2011<br />Submittal of Window 3 QDP October 1, 2010</p>
<p><br />Vendors who have received a favorable CRT-QDP assessment will receive the updated CRT-QMP schedule automatically.</p>
<p>All other interested parties will have to follow the process noted in Amendment 10 in order to receive any documentation related to this announcement. Vendors submitting a CRT-QDP for the second submission opportunity must submit the information requested in Amendment 10. It is estimated that the vetting process will take up to 10 business days. TSA will not grant vendors additional time for CRT-QDP submission to allow for vetting of a vendor.</p>
<p>Once a vendor is vetted, TSA will provide vendors with the opportunity to enter into CRT data collection. Vendors systems must be in place and ready to begin data collection no later than August 30, 2010 to participate. This data will be used by TSA to evaluate the CRT-QDP. TSA intends to use CRT data for equipment under various categories,</p>
<p>1) CRT data for TSA certified equipment without any configuration changes. Equipment under this category does not require re-testing for CRT and TSA will use existing CRT data to evaluate QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p>2) CRT data for TSA certified equipment with configuration changes. Data previously collected under this equipment category will not be utilized for QDP evaluation due to configuration changes after the initial certification. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process again in order to collect new CRT data for purposes of evaluating the QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p>3) CRT data for new systems never certified by TSA. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process just like certified equipment with configuration changes.</p>
<p>Vendors in category 2 &amp; 3 will be fully responsible for shipping, installation, and decommissioning of equipment proposed to be included in data collection. Note that TSA or vendor owned equipment currently located at the TSL may be eligible for use for CRT data collection purposes; however, Offerors that wish to use TSA-owned equipment will be solely responsible for configuration changes expenses before and after testing.</p>
<p>After data collection for equipment under 2 and 3 above is complete, TSA will share all system specific data simultaneously with the respective original equipment manufacturers. This includes data for equipment that falls under any of the equipment categories listed above. <br />NOTE: Vendors planning to participate in the upcoming CBIS procurement will need this data in order to properly prepare a complete QDP package.<br />Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov and provide Amendment 12: Company Name in the Subject Line.</p>
<p>This information is being shared with vendors for planning purposes only. Therefore, TSA is not responsible for any expenses incurred as a result of this RFI. The RFI does not represent an official acquisition plan nor does it commit the Government to any course of action in the future.</p>

<DESC>Q4: I was contacted by a large business concerning JDLM (HH60) and our potential for teaming. I saw where this is in the small business category. Are you considering placing this work in the 8a program? Sorry, if you answered this at Industry day, I did not attend.<br />A4: No, however, an 8a firm is not precluded from proposing on the effort.
<p>Q5: In reviewing the subject solicitation in FedBizOpps today and reading the Q&amp;A added yesterday, I noticed that SRA International was not listed as a prime contractor for the current USCG JDLM work. In fact SRA has been a prime contractor for a number of years providing logistics services for USAF-owned HH-60 JDLM. Current contract is GS-23F-0038L, Delivery Order HSCG38-08-F-410040.<br />A5: Answer 3 is revised to include SRA International, who provides logistics support on the current JDLM effort. Current contract is GS-23F-0038L, Delivery Order HSCG38-08-F-410040.</p>

<AWARDEE>Dooley Lumber Company, 702 East Balboa Blvd
, Newport Beach, CA 92661 US
<DESC>DSCP is issuing a Bridge Contract for the Wood Products for the Hawaii/Guam Region. Subject contract is for twelve months and twelve days to provide for the purchase of wood products, such as softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, preservative treated lumber, poles, pilings, crossarms, ties, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors, and moldings to support military customers in the Hawaii/Guam region. The Estimated Demand is $600,000.00. The maximum dollar value for this proposed contract is $3,000,000. For administrative purposes, the proposed bridge contract will use the same numbers as the current contract and will contain the same terms and conditions. The contract numbers are SPM500-05-D-BP21/SPM5E406D0254. Two contract numbers are utilized to prevent duplication of delivery order numbers as both system-processed (mechanized) orders and manual orders are issued. The effective period of the proposed bridge contract will be from June 24, 2010 through July 5, 2011. Should a competitively-awarded contract be issued ahead of the projected timeframe and the guaranteed minimum of $100,000 met, this bridge contact will be terminated. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements. Subject Bridge Contract is being awarded under Other than Full and Open Competition 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

S, C, 7016-1 and the Watershed Protection and Flood Control Act of 1954, 16 U. S. C. 1001-1012 are generally regulated by state dam safety agencies.  An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is a fundamental management tool that (1) describes appropriate actions for emergency response personnel to take during an emergency situation, and (2) attempts to lessen the adverse consequences of a dam failure.

Requirements:

1) The contractor shall revise existing curriculum for a training workshop with the primary objective of preparing the participants to assist owners of high hazard dams to develop Emergency Action Plans (EAPs).  The intent of the EPAs will be to better prepare the owners to respond to emergencies involved with the potential failure of their dams.

2) The workshops shall:  a) educate state dam safety officials and NRCS employees about the EAP process; b) educate state dam safety officials and NRCS employees about their roles, responsibilities, and liabilities related to the EAP process; c) provide training on preparing, modifying, administering and maintaining EAP; d) provide training strategy to include local emergency management personnel in the exercise process.  A draft of the revised curriculum and training materials for NRCS concurrence must be provided to the NRCS point of contact (POC) not later than August 1, 2010.

3) Arrange for qualified instructors.  Submit resumes for proposed instructors along with the final draft of the curriculum and training materials.  (Substitution of instructors after approval of the resumes shall only be done after written notification to and approval of NRCS.  No substitution may be done within three (3) days of the start of the workshops).

4) Propose workshop locations, facilities, and dates.  Submit proposed locations along with the final draft of the curriculum and training materials.  (Substitution or changes to approved locations, facilities, or dates shall only be made after written notification to and approval of NRCS.  No changes shall be made to the approved locations within 21 working days of the start of the workshops).

5) Conduct three (3) workshops consisting of a minimum of 14 hours of instruction each to a total of audience of approximately 180 State Dam Safety Officials and NRCS state staff members.  Workshop #1 shall be conducted not later than November 15, 2010.  Workshop #2 shall be conducted not later than March 31, 2011.  Workshop #3 shall be conducted not later than June 15, 2011.  The contractor must: a) organize all on-site preparations for the workshops; b) oversee marketing of all workshops; c) oversee all registrations/participant processes; d) pay all expenses associated with arranging for and conducting the workshops, including the instructor, training materials and training facility; and e) prepare and provide a copy of all training material to each participant.  Originals of all training materials shall become property of NRCS upon completion of the contract.  Participants will be responsible for their own travel costs to attend these workshops.

6) The contractor must prepare a summary report of each workshop including final list of participants, evaluation of the training experience, and recommendations for future training needs to include, but not limited to, suggested revisions in the training materials, methods of instruction, and locations not later than July 1, 2011.

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ09UA00023.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to the Management and Training Corporation (MTC) under contract number DOLJ09UA00023.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $54,000 to the Brunswick Job Corps Center, operated by Management and Training Corporation.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceilings for this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The CRA funding is intended to address facility deficiencies at Brunswick Job Corps Center.   The operator of the Brunswick JCC will procure the services of local construction and service providers, by making these funds available through subcontracting opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.
  
This Modification has been awarded on June 14, 2010.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification to redirect $86,233 in ARRA CRA funding previously awarded to Bamberg Job Corps Center operated by DESI to correct additional CRA deficiencies at Bamberg Job Corps Center.

<AWARDEE>AMERIVETS CONSTRUCTION INC;315 S BOLMAR ST STE 100;WEST CHESTER;PA;193824932
<DESC>Sole Source Justification

Solicitation VA-786A-10-RP-0084 is for the Irrigation Pump Replacement at the Long Island National Cemetery.  This solicitation is being Sole Sourced in accordance with PL 109-461 to Amerivets Construction, Inc.  

Long Island National Cemetery requires the repair or replacement of the motor for the existing water tank and pump station.  This pump is the primary source for the irrigation system supplying water throughout the entire 175 acres of the cemetery grounds.  This water is vital for maintaining the turf in accordance with the cemeteries required standards as a National Shrine.

At this time, the reactivation of the irrigation system is imperative in order to establish the sod placed as part of the completion of recent Millennium Projects.  In addition there are ongoing Millennium projects at the site that may warrant the demobilization of the contractors due to the lost of water resources. 

Amerivets Construction has prior experience with this type of work and we need a company with this experience to replace the failing pump.

Sole Sourcing to a SDVOSB is in the best interest of the Government.
