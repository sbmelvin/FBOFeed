<CONTACT>Melissa Rountree Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.Rountree;
<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION SYNOPSIS  for Faith-Based Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Program for Women of Color.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks, under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI), on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women?s Health, Washington, DC.  GovWorks is seeking potential contractors to provide one or more cardiovascular disease prevention programs for women of color, aged 40-60 years.  Each program shall be implemented at 25 faith-based sites throughout the United States.  Participants at each site shall be committed to increasing their level of physical activity and establishing a healthy weight over the course of the program.  The educational phase of the program shall consist of seven bi-monthly sessions that shall educate women on all of the major risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke--smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, obesity, and physical inactivity, while primarily focusing on controlling weight and increasing physical activity.  The maintenance phase of the project shall consist of regularly scheduled, interactive maintenance sessions that shall be designed by program participants.  All educational and maintenance sessions shall include small group discussions and a physical activity component focused on reducing risk.  The ultimate goal of this project is to reduce cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity among women of color in the US.  The project shall take approximately 18 months and will include three phases.  In 2001, the DHHS Office on Women?s Health funded a pilot cardiovascular disease prevention program in six churches across the United States through the Association of Black Cardiologists.  The program was designed to encourage cardiovascular disease risk reduction among African American women.  The program included personal risk assessment, cooperative support groups, and regularly scheduled educational sessions on cardiovascular disease risk factors and risk modification.  The new programs to be funded shall incorporate the most successful aspects of the pilot program as well as the lessons learned and feedback (to be provided upon issuance of the RFP to interested sources).  Additionally, the new programs shall expand upon other successful faith-based programs with similar goals.  GovWorks intends to issue one or more Time and Materials contracts for this procurement.  A draft copy of the Statement of Work can be found at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp .  As a result of this announcement, GovWorks will issue a solicitation to interested parties on or about October 24, 2003.  Interested parties shall identify their interest and request a copy of the solicitation package on or before 4:00 pm Eastern Time October 23, 2003.  Requests MUST be submitted via email to melissa.rountree@mms.gov  AND kimberly.blue@mms.gov.  The email must contain your company name and a point of contact including name, address, phone, fax, and email if you are interested in participating in this requirement.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Synopsis of an upcoming FDA solicitation. This is not a request for a formal proposal. 

This procurement will be a fixed-price, indefinite-quantity indefinite-delivery contract, with a base year plus four option years, for access to longitudinal patient-level electronic medical record (EMR) data.  The data shall provide a unique resource for the study of adverse reactions to prescription medications.  The objectives are to 1) provide direct access to longitudinal, population-based EMR data, including but not limited to the following types of information at a patient level: demographic, health history, diagnoses and procedures, laboratory test results, drug and biologic utilization and administration, and health encounters (e.g. hospitalizations, specialist visits, etc.); 2) provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet or network-based access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time; and 3) provide FDA personnel with the ability to download (or obtain by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.

The data shall meet the need of the FDA to access patient-level, longitudinal, EMR data.  The size and characteristics of the database population as well as a comparison of the database population to the larger geographic population from which it is derived shall be provided to the FDA, since these can affect the quality and usefulness of the data.  Characteristics of the database population shall minimally include the country of origin for the database population, number of people (active and inactive) in the database, extent of geographic diversity, demographics, size of special populations of interest (including children, women of childbearing age, and elderly patients); turnover rate, and enrollment data (if applicable) for participating individuals.  The electronic medical record shall include, but not be limited to, information concerning an individual’s health status, medical history, current medical conditions and health indicators (e.g. height, weight, blood pressure, smoking status), medications, allergies, vaccination and immunization history, visit history, and visits to other specialists or inpatient facilities.

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a six-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.  In addition, Offerors must be able to meet the following minimum mandatory requirements: verification of the commercial availability of the data resource as of June 1, 2003; verification that the database is in English, and includes English documentation and English-language-based training and technical support; verification that the database is accessible real-time via Internet or network-based methods, as of June 1, 2003; documentation that the database has a minimum of one million active patients as of June 1, 2003; confirmation that the Offeror shall provide training and a six-month trial subscription for two individuals, at no cost to the FDA, to the full, commercially available version of the database for the purposes of evaluation.  This trial subscription shall include direct access, documentation, and technical support for the entire trial subscription period; the Offeror shall provide FDA with a description of the process for downloading (or obtaining by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies; upon award, the Offeror shall agree to provide unlimited access to the data for FDA’s internal use without prior restraint, e.g., institutional review board (IRB) approval.  FDA acknowledges that any external release of results based on these data may be subject to mutually agreed-upon disclosure policies.

In addition, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the number of years of data available overall and in real time; the lag time between the health encounter date and online availability of the data; the mean, median, and range of observation time for patients in the database; the procedures for accessing data that are no longer online; the process for downloading datasets to be used for epidemiological investigations; and data collection and management procedures.  A complete data dictionary shall be included.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on October 15, 2003.

Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing proof for rights to use the data from the OEM.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA. Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to: Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center P.O.

All responses to this market survey will be considered prior to further acquisition action by the Government.  Any information received as a result of this announcement will not be provided to other contractors and will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to procure engineering technical services in support of the tasks associated with TAMPS version 6.2.1 engineering products.  The TAMPS version 6.2.1 was released to the fleet in FY-2001, to remain in operation until such time as it was to be replaced by the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  Technical services and sustainment support for TAMPS version 6.2.1 are required until fleet introduction of JMPS.  TAMPS 6.2.1 engineering sustainment support is necessary for mission planning, imagery exploitation processing, force, strike level and route planning.  Mission Planning Modules (MPM) provide the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps with an automated means to plan and analyze mission routes against threats and targets in an operational environment.  TAMPS and MPM support all Navy aircraft, e.g. F-14, F-18, AV-8B, EA-6B, E-2C, AH-1W, ES-3, C-2A and SH-60.  The required services will provide software engineering sustainment support for TAMPS 6.2.1 products.  The Government anticipates awarding a five-year basic, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity delivery order contract through other than full and open competition to BAE Systems Mission Solutions, 16550 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, CA  92127-1806.  As the designer and developer for the TAMPS 6.2.1, BAE Systems has the required technical and engineering expertise and the technical data package for TAMPS 6.2.1, including data not delivered to the government.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm, other than BAE Systems Mission Solutions should respond in accordance with Numbered Note 22.  Numbered Note 26 also applies.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 23 October 2003 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home pages at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for a variety of seminars entitled "Building High-Performance Organizations" to be conducted periodically for Center personnel for a period of up to five years.  The number and types of seminars will be specified within a range of quantities in the resultant solicitation. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase performance of these seminars from the Commonwealth Centers for High Performance Organizations (CCHPO) of Charleston, S.C. 29401.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.  Presentation of these seminars is considered essential for identifying and implementing at Dryden proven leadership philosophies, values, functions and other aspects characterizing high-performing organizations.  Throughout the year, selected Center personnel will be invited to participate in periodic seminar presentations, and apply learned principles to their respective organizations.  The intended results are more focused planning, more effective decision making, and increased resource utilization.  Without these particular seminars, the intended results would be seriously jeopardized and the Center would be deprived of the anticipated benefits resulting therefrom. The series of seminars anticipated by this procurement are a continuation of HPO presentations that were initiated at Dryden in September, 2002.  Since then, many Center personnel have begun implementing the unique and inclusive leadership aspects characterizing this approach to being more effective.  This has resulted in a recognizable Center leadership culture that will be continued and expanded through the additional seminars purchased for FY2004.  The HPO seminars, therefore, embody a unique myriad of leadership functions, philosophy, diagnostic/change model, and other concepts the Center intends to perpetuate. CCHPO is the only known firm that encompasses these leadership theories and practices into a viable teaching and motivating approach.  Principals and associates of the firm are uniquely qualified, with conceptual understanding and practical experience, to convey the desired leadership intent.  Accordingly, no other known firm could meet the Government's requirements in providing these particular seminars. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 23, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Parklawn Health Library, Division of Technical Support, AOS/PSC (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Ovid Technologies, Norwood, MA.
Purpose:
 
The Parklawn Health Library (PHL) is requesting access to Ovid’s (previously SilverPlatter) electronic database services for the period October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004.
	With the merger of SilverPlatter and Ovid Technologies in 2001, Ovid has become a total solution for the library’s research needs.  Some of the unique features of Ovid technologies are:  SilverLinker links directly to the full text articles, LinkWizard takes the user from WebSpirs to applicable Internet sites identified by the library staff, every word can be searched from the Ovid e-journals and webstats are sent automatically.  In addition, our staff has done research to determine if another vendor can provide all of the required databases under a single interface and found that only Ovid’s SilverPlatter brand meets these requirements.  

	It has been the library’s experience during the past eleven years that SilverPlatter’s/Ovid search engine provides the best customer satisfaction, i.e., ease of use and effective retrieval.  Use of a common search engine also allows library clients to perform the same search across several databases when necessary without having to re-key the same search strategy separately for each database accessed.  Likewise, clients can use the same consistent commands when searching Ovid databases.  The speed and quality of seamless, full-text retrieval from the variety of topical databases, made possible both by proprietary database construction and proprietary software, make Ovid uniquely qualified as the only supplier of the ERL,  wide-area networking system.

 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The informa tion provided in response to this RFI/SSN will be used to identify qualified vendor sources and assist the government in its preparation of program funding requirements.   Directional antenna systems are key to enabling network-centric applications for the Future Combat System (FCS) and Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T). Directional antenna technologies have been evaluated under the DARPA FCS Communications ( FCS-C) program, and emerging SMART directional antenna technologies have recently been identified during the Army Science Board's (ASB) ad hoc Advanced Antennas study. A new Science and Technology Objective (STO) program entitled Multi-dimensional, Assured , Robust, Communications for an OTM Network (MARCON-i)  is beginning development of a SCA compliant, directional networking waveform utilizing enhanced multilayered QoS and antenna beamforming / steering protocols. One of the goals of this effort is to eli minate omni-directional networks.  A key risk area identified under this program is the cost to develop and produce directional antennas.   The government is interested in directive antenna system approaches that will support the directive networking efforts initiated under the Marcon-i STO, and can operate in the JTRS Cluster 1 frequency band (2MHz to 2GHz) and the newly emerging Cluster 6 fr equency band operating above 2GHz (possibly up to 44 GHz). It is envisioned that these directive antenna systems will be integrated into FCS type platforms similar to the Stryker or Bradley variants.  Design approaches should consider the limited space ava ilable on these types of platforms for integration, and realize that  low profile designs are preferred. The antenna systems proposed may consider beamforming, switched beam(s), hybrid solution sets or innovative design approaches.  Design approaches that can leverage DARPA's FCS-C directional antenna technologies are desirable. Unit production cost is a primary driver. Interested parties are to submit white papers that shall include, but are not limited to the following information:   a.	descriptions of candidate approaches b.	expected performance c.	advantages / disadvantages of candidate approaches d.	discussion of design maturity and remaining development  e.	configuration drawings or illustrations of physical profiles f.	mounting concepts  g.	technical and schedule risk assessments h.	modeling & simulation capabilities  i.	unit quantities required to achieve a production unit cost of 10-15 K  White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM, 24 Oct 2003, at HQ USA CECOM, Attn: AMSRD-CER-ST-WL-AA (Steve Goodall), Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey 07703-5203.  Questions concerning this announcement may be addressed to Steve Goodall at 732-532-0445, Fax  number 732-427-4611, or Steven.Goodall@us.army.mil .

<DESC>The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) requires the short term lease of narrow bodied (single aisle) large passenger/transport jet aircraft.  This requirement will be unrestricted under full and open competition.  The NAICS Code is 532411 with a size standard of $6 million.  Because the aircraft to be acquired will be flown by JPATS pilots/crew, only the following aircraft types, for which JPATS pilots are certified, will be solicited:  McDonnell Douglas MD82/83/88 Aircraft, Boeing 727-200 Advanced Aircraft, and Boeing 737-300/400 Aircraft.  All aircraft shall be U.S. registered transport category turbojets, meeting Stage III noise criteria, with a Certificate of Airworthiness.  The aircraft will generally depart and return to one of three designated points: 1) Oklahoma City, OK; 2) Mesa, AZ; 3) Alexandria, LA; however, JPATS may require alternative sites for positioning/re-positioning of the aircraft.  It is estimated that each of the aircraft will be flown approximately 15 to 30 hours per week.  The contractor shall provide the aircraft, all maintenance (including line maintenance/line servicing/aircraft cleaning), logistics support, and insurance.  

JPATS anticipates acquiring these aircraft under a multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, utilizing individual delivery orders to acquire aircraft for each of its three operational sites.  Each IDIQ contract awarded will be for a one (1) year base and two (2) one-year options.  This solicitation will utilize the procedures in FAR 12.602, Streamlined Evaluation of Offers, in performing the evaluation to select the offer(s) that is most advantageous to the Government.  Offerors will be evaluated on their (1) Past Performance on similar projects, (2) Price, and (3) To be considered for award, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission that it has the ability to provide aircraft maintained under an FAA approved maintenance program for a certificated Part 121/125 operator or through an FAA Part 145 Certificated Repair Station utilizing the original manufacturer's Maintenance Planning Document (MPD).  Only those proposals, which meet the criteria, shall be evaluated.  
 
Solicitation MS-04-R-0005 will be available on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on or about 20 Oct 2003 with proposals due thirty days from the issue date of the RFP.  The RFP will be posted in its entirety at this FedBizOpps website.  NOTE: Contractors proposing on this solicitation must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award or payment for any delivery orders issued.  The CCR database can be accessed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued and no electronic proposal submissions will be accepted.  All questions must be submitted in writing either by e-mail or fax to the addresses/fax number listed below by 4:00 pm CDT on 27 Oct 2003.  To ensure that you receive all information regarding this solicitation, please register to receive updates at www.fedbizopps.gov and follow the procedures for notification registration.

The objective is to minimize the number and types of sensors required to perform the complete EAADS mission. BMC4I: The EAADS BMC4I communications and battle manager must provide operational capability for force operations planning, coordination, directing,  and controlling of EAADS in support of the UA.  The BMC4I links FCS passive defense, active defense, and attack operations to provide timely assessment of the AMD threat, and must include intelligence preparation of the battlefield, rapid dissemination of  tactical warning, and post-strike assessment to the FCS element.  For each EAADS operational element, a BMC4I node must provide the capability for planning FO and some EO.  It must also provide the capability for coordinating, directing, and controlling E AADS engagement operations for surveillance in support of the UE and the UA.  All nodes require embedded training capabilities.  In developing concepts for the EAADS BMC4I system, the following technical requirements should be considered:  Battery/Platoon FO and certain EO nodes, hardware/software/network architecture, battle management planning models and simulations, engagement planning models and simulations, threat discrimination, interoperability, communications.  BMC4I communications and battle manage r will interface with EAADS and external surveillance and warning systems, intelligence assets, decision-making facilities, and EAADS fire control elements.  The EAADS BMC4I fire control manager must provide engagement operations, RAM surveillance, plannin g, coordination, directing, and controlling of EAADS weapons in support of the UA.  EAADS BMC4I fire control will have the following technical requirements: fire control nodes, engagement operations, architecture, fire control models and simulations, inter operability, platform, and local communications requirements including latency, compatibility.  The EAADS BMC4I fire control will interface with the EAADS BMC4I communications and battle manager, fire control sensors, and with EAADS weapons. The RFI is seeking innovative ideas for the following BMC4I Communications and Battle Manager technologies:  BM planning models and simulation tools, engagement planning models and simulation tools, and surveillance processing, BMC4I uncertainty analysis t ools, decision aids, impact point prediction, data processors, interoperability translator, and packaging. The RFI seeks innovative ideas for the following critical EAADS BMC4I fire control technologies:  Engagement architecture, controlling of rules of en gagement and management by exception strategies, algorithms and software development, communications elements to reduce data latency and prioritize messages for critical engagement operations, data protocols and unique algorithms, use of expanded bandwidth , enhanced data rates, high-speed processing, span of control, rules of engagement, precision pointing, computational equipment, and BMC4I fire control models and simulations.  Special emphasis will be given but not limited to the following:  the quantity,  speed, accuracy, and latency of data exchange between the fire control and weapon during multiple simultaneous engagements and the degree of centralization (or decentralization) of BMC4I functions to include surveillance, force warning, situational awaren ess, common operational picture, airspace management, counter battery, target identification and type classification, and inner tier fire control.  The question is how should functions such as engagement operations be distributed between potential elements  such as the acquisition sensor, operations center, fire control node, weapon platform, and weapon. The objective is to design the network architecture to execute the functions within the time and accuracy required to perform the complete EAADS mission. RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS The system concept and critical technology ideas provided by respondents will be used to augment and refine the current government system concepts and associated critical technologies.

<DESC>Subject to the availability of funds and project approval, VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for preparation of working drawings and specifications, cost estimate, submittal review and other construction period services for Project Number 528-707 Construct Addition for Cath Lab/CT at the VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY.  The purpose of this project is to provide space for a new Cardiac Catheterization Lab and an additional (second) Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner. The Syracuse VA Medical Center currently accomplishes Cath lab procedures using equipment that is almost at the end of its useful life. The new equipment planned for this function will not fit into the existing space. An additional CT scanner is required to reduce the waiting times associated with the workload of the existing scanner. An analysis has shown that construction of new space is the most effective way to meet the needs of our patients.  This project involves the construction of an additional floor to accommodate these functions. The addition will be placed over an area that is now being constructed and was structurally designed to support an additional floor level. The design will try to comply as much as possible with the goal to align the functionality of services, placing the new equipment adjacent to the Imaging Department, which is located on the 3rd floor. The construction will meet all applicable Patient Privacy/UFAS/H-08-09 space planning standard/criteria, and will comply with the VA Design Guide.  The design entails evaluating the existing areas that adjoin the future addition and determining the optimal way of tying into the space in terms of cost, NFPA compliance, impact on existing activities and functionality. The designer shall perform a structural analysis to ensure the capability of the existing building to support the new construction and equipment. The VA will inform the designer of the intended make and model of the equipment as soon as possible so as to allow compliance with any specific requirements. This will occur after award of the design contract. The designer will evaluate the electrical power (and other utility) requirements and include all necessary construction to bring necessary utilities to the addition.  The project will include providing all telephone and computer network infrastructure required and affected by the construction. The addition will be approximately 6.000 square feet.  Services require mechanical, electrical, structural, civil, architectural, and asbestos abatement investigation of the existing facility as necessary including full on-site investigation to verify existing conditions as it pertains to this project. Investigative services shall include review of VA program requirements and project scope to determine the equipment and construction criteria, and to provide preliminary plans, drawings, and estimates.  Design services shall include, but not be limited to, providing complete working drawings, specifications, and detailed cost estimates.  Services include meet with various VA employees, in order to fully understand the functional needs, carefully review the space selected for this project, then prepare construction cost estimates, designs and construction contract documents as described herein.  Design services for asbestos abatement, if found to be required at any time during the project, shall be included.  Design services shall include infection control design in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards.  Asbestos Monitoring services during construction may be required of the A/E as a reimbursable expense. VA if required may contract for these services separately.  Design services shall also include interior design including graphics, signage, equipment and furniture.  Provide computer generated color isometric views as directed by the COTR to illustrate the design.  Designer shall work with GSA contract vendors (as necessary and at designer’s expense) to develop furniture plans and drawings, window treatments, equipment listings and layouts for purchase directly by VA. Drawings will be CADD generated with Auto Cad 14.  Specifications shall be compiled from VA master specifications which are available on the internet.  Selection of the Architect/Engineer will be based on specialized experience, capability of the firm to perform, professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to the project, past performance for VA work and/or similar hospital projects, and the record of past performance in the form of a comparison between their estimates and actual project awards.  The area of consideration is restricted to firms within a 165 radius of the Medical Center.  Appropriate data for this project must be submitted on Standard Forms 254 and 255 no later than November 14, 2003.  FIVE COPIES OF EACH (along with any supplemental information) ARE REQUIRED.  Submission should emphasize experience on similar projects (Block 10 of the SF 254), the personnel to be assigned to this project (Block 4 of the SF 255), and specific VA experience.  A/E Selection will not be made until at least 4-6 weeks after receipt of applications and may not occur until March 2004.  This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 54131 applies.  Construction cost estimate is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.

<DESC>NA CODE  R Ã¢Â€Â“ Sources Sought Market Survey The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, PM Light Tactical Vehicle (PM LTV) Office, Warren, MI, is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey due 6 December 2003.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Gov ernment is not requesting any interested or potential suppliers to incur any expenses of any kind in connection with their review of the enclosures or their response to this survey.  Nothing contained herein should be regarded as basis upon which to seek p ayment, reimbursement or other consideration from the Government.  Furthermore, this is not intended as a solicitation of any proposal and submissions of an 'unsolicited proposal' will not be given consideration.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM-Warren.   Sources Sought for Environmental Control Kit for Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV specific)  This market survey is to determine what commercially available Environmental Control Kits (ECK) are available for supplemental climate control in the crew compartment of HMMWVs. It is also intended to obtain information on the current capabilities, availab ility, and estimated product and life cycle costs of such kits.  Based on review and analysis of vendor responses, TACOM/PM LTV may elect to develop a performance specification or commercial item description for competitive procurement of environmental con trol kits for tactical wheeled vehicles (TWV). There is no restriction on the type of construction for the ECK, although a portable model or a bolt-on, bolt-off system with simple installation and removal is required.  The emphasis is on providing a cooler cab compartment for the crew.  Additional heat ing capability provided by the ECK is an optional feature, but not a requirement. The ECK proposed for the HMMWV and other TWVs shall, at a minimum, provide cooling comfort for a four-man crew.  The level of cooling provided by the ECK within the TWV, shall be quantified both in change from ambient temperature (ÃŽÂ”Ã‚Â°F) and crew compa rtment volume cooled (ft3).   If there are additional features to a proposed ECK beyond those captured in the specifications above, the vendor shall define them and state how they will benefit the Government. The vendor shall identify high-cost drivers so that the Government can decide  which features to trade-off if necessary.  It is the goal of the TACOM/PM LTV to provide a bolt-on cooling kit to HMMWVs.  Product information provided should address life cycle costs, kit weight, and all relevant performance capabilities.   The informati on provided shall also identify interface needs, such as power, interface space, mounting needs/structure, etc. Interested sources shall provide the following: 1.	Supplier name, address, phone number, CAGE code, and POC. 2.	Unit style, model number, and name. 3.	Current performance for each suggested model including: cooling capacity, reliability, durability, availability, maintainability, efficiency rating, type of system, etc. 4.	Vehicle interface needs such as: power requirements, electrical interface, mounting surface needs, volume needs, air flow needs, fastening points and sizes, etc. 5.	Weight and dimensions for each model. 6.	Estimated costs for system for both four-man and two-man configurations. 7.	Additional features, such as reliability and durability of system, maintenance, and associated costs/life cycle savings. 8.	Identify product features that have been verified, verification method, location and date of verification. 9.	If your product has ever been mounted on a HMMWV, state when and where that was performed, what model ECK was used, and where and how it was mounted on the HMMWV. Interested sources may obtain copies of this Market Survey, draft performance criteria and representative drawings located under Market Surveys and Sources Sought Notices on the TACOM Acquisition Web Page at: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/opportunity.htm.  All interested firms regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this announcement. Responses to this Market Survey should be sent to Steve Sabbagh and sh all include the information requested in items 1-9 above.  You may either e-mail or send hard copies of your response.

<DESC>APPLICATION SUPPORT CENTERS (ASC) - WORLDWIDE:  The following is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only.  DHS has a worldwide requirement for: fingerprinting and other biometrics collection; ASC scheduling center/local scheduling support; outreach mobile route operations; facilities leasing/maintenance; application collection; special projects; forms and information distribution; citizenship testing services; project/administrative support; and other services to individuals seeking immigration benefits and/or entry into the U.S.A.  

Biometrics capture and other services for approximately 2.9 million immigration applicants annually is currently performed by almost 1,100 contractor staff at: approximately 135 government- or contractor-leased ASCs throughout the USA and its territories; over 45 domestic mobile routes; three overseas ASC test sites in Russia, Austria, and Kenya; and approximately 17 overseas mobile routes.  Sites may be added, moved, or deleted worldwide, and may include up to 150 overseas mobile routes with some travel to very primitive locations. Overseas sites/routes may be required in Europe, Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and Pacific locations.  DHS anticipates significant ASC organizational and process changes to meet future workload and homeland security issues.  Changes may include expanding biometrics capture to all immigration-benefits applicants (approximately 7 million annually), and/or to significantly expand or relocate biometrics collection overseas.  

The prime vendor must assume all leases for contractor-leased space (currently 83 leases), and may be required to obtain leases for a new domestic scheduling center, and potentially all overseas sites.  All contractor staff must be U.S. citizens, and must be able to obtain a T-2 clearance.  Labor categories will vary by site and may consist of site supervisors, quality assurance specialists, biometrics technicians, application technicians, linguists, armed and unarmed guards, schedulers, and other labor categories that cover the work listed above.

The DHS intends to acquire these services by awarding a competitive multiple-year BPA to up to two prime contractors with current General Services Administration (GSA) contracts.  All prime-contractors  MUST be Schedule 84 contract holders. Team members must be GSA Schedule contract holders. Subcontractors (non-team members) will not need to be Schedule holders.  DHS intends to limit Prime Offeror Teams to combined business concerns/organizations over 2,500 employees due to the staffing and management requirements of this large-magnitude project.    DHS will provide electronic solicitation copies only.  DHS anticipates receipt of proposals by January 2004, BPA award(s) by July 2004, and full contractual performance to begin November 2004.

	All interested business concerns shall provide the company name, mailing address, point of contact, email address, GSA Schedule 84 contract information, and information indicating the vendor's capability to provide these services in ten (10) or less pages, to the contracting officer listed below.  Text shall be at least single spaced, on a 8 ½ x 11 inch paper, with a minimum one inch margin all around.  Pages shall be numbered consecutively.  Pages submitted in excess of the page limitations stated throughout this document will not be evaluated.
	
Font Size - Print shall be of a minimum 12-point font size or a maximum 10 characters per inch (10-pitch, pica) spacing.  If not currently on GSA Schedule 84, your response MUST include replies to the following questions:  (1) Is your company willing to take the steps necessary to get on GSA Schedule 84?  (2) Please provide your anticipated timeframe and plan to get on GSA Schedule 84.  All prime contractors considered eligible for this award must be on GSA Schedule 84 by December 31, 2003.

The Department of Homeland Security  encourages the establishment of Contract Teaming Arrangements in accordance with - and as prescribed by - FAR Subpart 9.6.  

Use of information received from industry to complete final planning documents will be at the discretion of the government.  The government will not pay for the information solicited.  Proprietary information shall not be sent.  Questions may be submitted via email to the contracting officer only on August 18, 2003.  Submit responses no later than September 2, 2003 via email.  Attachments must be MS Office 97 compatible.  Reply to Jeanette Housen, email address jeanette.housen@dhs.gov, telephone number (202) 305-3113.  An electronic response is the only accepted method.

TSA is establishing Mission Support Centers (MSC) in four (4) locations around the nation. The Mission Support Centers will be located in the following cities:  Atlanta, San Francisco, Dallas and Detroit.

Installation, Qualification and Acceptance testing, and all training relative to the three AECS.   Installation shall be conducted during normal working hours, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  Installation operations may be allowed on second shift with prior authorization.
Notification of Visit.  
The contractor shall give notification to the NADEP project engineer or COR at least five days prior to the date of each visit.  The project engineer and contracting officer’s representative will be noted in the contract award document.  
Notification shall be provided as follows: Attention: Security Manager, Naval Air Depot,  NAS Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, 32212-0016, Phone:(904) 542-0887.  Fax: (904) 542-2805.
Technical capability of the proposed AECS Upgrade to meet the Government requirements will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in the proposal.  Therefore, it is imperative that each offeror provides sufficient technical documentation, specifications, etc. in order for the Government to perform an adequate technical assessment.  Product sales literature such as bulletins and specification sheets typically do not provide sufficient information for an adequate assessment.  In addition, a statement that the proposed autoclave upgrade will operate per the Government’s specification will not suffice without a description of how the proposed upgrade will meet the Government’s requirements as specified in this RFP.
