<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office (UCAO) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to assist the UCAO, by providing technical and other services, in fulfilling its obligations as specified under the Endangered Species Act to the Bull trout.   Bull Trout are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.  The purpose is to develop a plan and implement those solutions as developed within the plan to ensure upstream and downstream passage for bull trout from Yakima Project Reservoirs through the inundation zone during drought conditions.   The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1) (i) (2).   WDFW as the co-manager of the states fishery resources have the authority and the responsibility to ensure passage during drought conditions.  WDFW has an established and on-going program to survey and implement temporary passage structures to rectify blockages due to drought condition.  WDFW has agreements and procedures in place to access the Washington Conservation Corp and the Americorp to enable them to acquire personnel immediately to address emergency issues caused by drought.  The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs.  Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, insufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  All responses received by close of business December 14, 2007 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Goverment not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Goverment.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining wether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5611, Attn. Connie Morgan, or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Office of Contract Operations, Major Systems Acquisition Division, of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Headquarters expects to release Request for Proposal (RFP) No. HSCG23-08-R-ADA011 to procure Increment 2 Phase I of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS).  The expected release date for the RFP is on or about December 20, 2007.  The USCG contemplates an award of one hybrid type contract.

The NAIS, which uses international standards-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship communication of navigation information to support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), is being implemented by the USCG incrementally.  Increment 1, which was completed at the end of FY 2007, is operational and providing receive-only capability in 55 critical ports and 9 coastal areas across the country.  Increment 2, to be implemented over two phases, will establish coastal transmit and receive capability nationwide.  Increment 3 will provide long-range receive capability nationwide.  Phase 2 of Increment 2 and Increment 3 will be the subject of separate procurements.

Increment 2 Phase I, which is the subject of this RFP, involves the work necessary to design, develop and deliver the core NAIS capability, achieve NAIS receive and transmit coverage for three designated Coast Guard Sectors to establish Initial Operational Capability (IOC); and, to provide systems engineering, physical and logical shore stations hardware and software, initial logistics, and Sector coverage design services to support post-IOC deployment towards achieving Full Operational Capability (FOC) or complete receive and transmit coverage.

This core system shall provide all of the necessary I-2 functionality for a fully-capable system, albeit with a limited number of Physical Shore Stations (PSSs) and Logical Shore Stations (LSSs).  The core capability of the NAIS, which is a subset of the IOC, is defined as the following system elements or capabilities:

     ** Centralized storage and enterprise services for the Enterprise Data Center (EDC), to include data storage, data retrieval, and external data capture services, as well as the interfaces to the External Data Providers and External AIS User Systems as described in the PSPEC; 

     ** The AIS Service Management at the System Operations Center (SOC), to include the SOC User Human System Interface as described in the PSPEC; 

     ** Three Physical Shore Stations (PSSs) ? one at Government designated site within Sector Delaware Bay and two at the Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN);

     ** Two Logical Shore Stations (LSSs) ? functionality to be provided at the SOC and  C2CEN;

     ** Both the Sector Command Center User and SOC User Human System Interface components;

     ** Incorporation of Increment 1 AIS data feeds into the EDC; and

     ** All network functions and capabilities associated with connecting these elements into a fully integrated and monitored system that meets the information assurance requirements of the SOW and the PSPEC.

The USCG will be hosting a site visit at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey on or about January 8, 2008 to familiarize interested Offerors on Government infrastructure relevant to the NAIS procurement.  Presentations will be provided on NAIS/Rescue-21 integration testing, existing Rescue-21 sites within the designated IOC Sectors, Sector Command Centers within the IOC Sectors, NAIS Increment-1 sites within the IOC Sectors and USCG Centers of Excellence, including the Coast Guard Navigation Center (NAVCEN) and the Operations System Center (OSC,  Martinsburg, WV) facilities and capabilities.

In addition, potential Offerors will have the opportunity to visit the Cape May, NJ, Rescue-21 Remote Fixed facility (RFF) where the Coast Guard has conducted an initial assessment of the feasibility and interoperability of collocating NAIS systems at Rescue 21 remote sites.

Potential Offerors interested in attending the site visit must register on the NAIS I-2 RFP Development Website:  www.naisproject.net.  At this time, attendance is limited to two representatives per company.

The NAIS Project Office has established a Technical Library to provide a variety of relevant technical information on system design guidance and existing capabilities.  To view the contents of the Technical Library, Potential Offerors are required to register for access at the following location: http://www.naisproject.net/NAIS_External/NAISDiscussion/tech_registrationform.asp.

Registration requires completing a registration form, signing a non-disclosure agreement, and sending in the non-disclosure agreement via fax or e-mail (if the signed agreement is scanned as a PDF beforehand).  The NAIS Contracting Officer will review submitted registrations.  If approved, a unique username and password will be electronically mailed to the registrant.

Notice for Filing Agency Protests:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593,

Technical Assistance for the Implementation Plan for the Modernization of the Malawi Department of Civil Aviation 

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance aimed at establishing an autonomous Civil Aviation Authority with a supportive legal and regulatory framework and adequate institutional capabilities.

The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) is not a stand-alone aviation authority as it currently functions under the Ministry of Transport and Public Works.  It is responsible for overseeing safety and security related issues; however, due to the lack of financial resources, the DCA has not been able to operate under internationally accepted safety standards or provide adequate services to airport users.  The Government of Malawi has concluded that a restructuring is essential to enable Malawi's aviation sector to become compliant with international standards of safety and security, and to ensure adequate levels of service in order to promote economic development.  

The Terms of Reference includes the following tasks:

Task 1:  Project Start-Up
Task 2:  Organizational Structure
2.1:  Preliminary Review of Staffing Requirements
2.2:  Analysis of Staffing Requirements and Implementation Plan
2.3:  Identification of Organizational Costs
2.4:  Training Seminar
Task 3:  Legal Framework Assistance
Task 4:  Certification Procedures
4.1:  Pilot Certification
4.2:  Aircraft Certification
4.3:  Air Carrier Certification
4.4:  Airport Certification
Task 5:  Evaluation of Security and Accident Investigation Procedures
Task 6:  Financial Analysis and Plan
Task 7:  Plan for Private Sector Participation
Task 8:  Developmental Impact 
Task 9:  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $460,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></b>  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, January 14, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 30 Mar 2008; FY 09 by 30 Mar 2009, and FY10 by 30 Mar 2010.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Apr 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the lab's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required to support of automated COMINT collection and processing.  Solutions to basic research and engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought.  The overall technical objectives of the BAA are to develop techniques and algorithms for the detection, recognition, exploitation, and location of analog and digital communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. We are interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation; (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved digital signal processing hardware and software. The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Signal detection; (2) Signal recognition and classification in low Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) environments; (3) Improved methods to accomplish geolocation; (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD) algorithms; (5) Interference cancellation; (6) Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA)/Frequency Difference Of Arrival (FDOA) techniques; (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices; (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked); and (9) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms.  Detailed scope and definition of problems follow here: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, geolocation in moderate to low SINR environments: Current SIGINT platforms are inundated with multiple signals of interest across the spectrum, but are not able to process all of the high priority signals for a host of reasons including dense signal environments, low power signals, low SINR, power control, etc. (2) Any technologies that will enable current systems greater ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and locate signals would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation:  Technology to further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is another area of research covered by this BAA.  Particular attention will be paid to technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters beneath interference.  (4) Multi-User Detection: Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired.  Specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms are also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamformed, digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antenna are desired. (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques for improved geolocation for moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable is desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: We are interested in developing the above capabilities for existing and emerging military and commercial radio communications. (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked): We are interested in techniques for second, third and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (9) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Attention to DSP requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; as well as the qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives. (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. 

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

<SUBJECT>99 -- Rotatable Bayonet Receiver
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-RBR

<CONTACT>Richard Williams, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-4728, Email richard.williams@brooks.af.mil - Richard Williams, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-4728, Email richard.williams@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>1. This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a direct result of this RFI.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or on any follow-up information requests.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources. Please do not request a copy of a solicitation. 

2.  The Government is seeking, for preliminary planning purposes only, experienced sources capable of delivering a new technology/capability for the Aircrew Life Support (ALS) community.  The required capability is a Rotatable Bayonet Receiver (RBR) for aircrew flight helmets.  This capability may be considered for application throughout all Major Commands (MAJCOMS) and may need to accommodate design differences between various oxygen masks in the AF supply inventory.  

3.  Current bayonet receivers are not designed to allow for an ALS or Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) technicians to make rapid changes in the fit of an aircrew member?s oxygen mask.  The Air Force is seeking information on an RBR that provides ALS personnel the capability to quickly adjust aircrew flight helmet bayonet receivers.  Due to the design differences (angle) of the bayonets installed on MBU-5/P, 12/P, 20/P & 20A/P oxygen masks, it is difficult to properly integrate the helmet with the Aircrew Eye & Respiratory Protective (AERP) system.  If the bayonet receiver rotates, ALS/AFE technicians could simply change the "receiving" angle on the helmet mounted bayonet receivers which would allow proper fit of an AERP mask and quickly convert back to a MBU-20/P fit.   
4.  As a minimum the Air Force is seeking information on technology which will:

a. Provide a minimum of 30 degrees of rotation plus or minus 15 degrees from a nominal position.      
b. Provide capability to lock the receiver in position once adequate angle/fit is obtained. 
c. Provide the capability of "free hinging" consistent with currently fielded hinged bayonet receivers.      
d. Hinge capability must be available for both left and right side as mounted on aircrew flying helmets.    
e. Provide capability for receiver to be installed in a fixed position on both left and right side as mounted on aircrew flying helmets.   
f. Anti-snag and slick capability must be available for both left and right side as mounted on aircrew flying helmets.   
g. Use of standard tools for installation on aircrew flying helmets.
h. Hardware used to attach the receiver to the aircrew flying helmet will be Phillips head screws.
i. If additional hardware (Screws) is required, the use of Phillips head will be consistent throughout design.        
j. Integrate with all current and planned (post milestone B) ALS equipment. 
k. Adjustments accessible only by ALS/AFE personnel.  
l. No training required for ALS/AFE personnel to install on aircrew flying helmets. 
m. Metal parts must be kept to a minimum as to not interfere with Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System magnetic field mapping.  
n. Compatible on both HGU-55/P and HGU-55A/P aircrew flying helmets.  
o. Provide ALS/AFE personnel the capability to adjust the "angle" of receiver from outside of helmet with standard tools commonly found in ALS shops.
p. Meet or exceed current MIL SPEC standards of bayonet receivers currently utilized on aircrew flight helmets in the AF supply inventory.   
q. Be logistically sustainable, stock listed and supported via current aircrew helmet technical order guidance. 
r. Color similar to currently fielded bayonet receivers.
s. Operability: Allow aircrew to operate hinge capability with one gloved Mission Oriented Protective Posture -4 hand.
t. Mean Time Before Failure rate will remain consistent with currently fielded hinged bayonet receivers. 

5.  As a minimum the Government is seeking information on an RBR which has the following characteristics:  
a. All performance specification thresholds meet or exceeds the thresholds in the current bayonet receiver
b. This technology/capability will be available no later than 14 December 2007. 
c. At least 95% of test data will be available no later than 14 December 2007. 
d. Test data/reports will be made available for government review and will include, but not be limited to: weight, wind blast, centrifuge, sled.  
e. The bayonet receivers is available in kits to retrofit the existing HGU-55/P and HGU-55A/P aircrew flying helmets.

7.  Please forward all responses to the following points of contacts: Mr. Rick Williams, 210-536-4728 (richard.williams@brooks.af.mil); Ms. Priscilla Cruz, 210-536-2068 (Priscilla.cruz@brooks.af.mil)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Ft. Gordon, GA, US Army Medical Command Southeast Region has a requirement for Surgical orthopedic Implants and other medical supplies. The Government intends to award a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)  for this requirement (Note 22), for this requirement.  The suggested contractor is Zimmer Inc. 345 Main Street, Warsaw, IN  46580-2717.  The Implant System, as with many other commodities, numerous products will theoretically and technically offer similar  or identical levels of of performance.  It is essential, however, that a physician utilize surgically implanted products with which he/she has the very highest degree of training, experience knowledge and confidence. The high cost of these products makes it both fiscally and physically impractical to purchase, maintain and rotate adequate levels of stock.  This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.

<DESC>THIS NOTICED IS MODIFIED TO POST QUESTION AND ANSWERS WHICH HAVE ARISEN DURING THE RFQ PROCESS. NOTE CLOSING DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 12/07/07:

1.) We understand that the requirement for chemical analysis of the shafting will include removing shavings from the shaft sections and sending them to a lab for analysis. We would prefer that the Government specify the location for shaving removal in this case.

Reply to Contractor:  Drill a sample hole adjacent to the centering hole ?? to 3/8? to get sample.  If shaft material and heat treatment is already stamped no chemical analysis will be necessary.
 
2.) We also understand that the history is unknown on these shafts with regard to ultrasonic examination as required by paragraph 3.3.2 of reference 2.3.1.c. Therefore, we will include ultrasonic inspection of the shafting in our proposal.

Reply to Contractor:  Ultrasonic examination will be required IAW references above.
 
3.) We have successfully installed split-type CuNi shaft sleeves on several US Naval vessel propulsion shafts. We are very familiar with utilizing strain gages to monitor stresses in the sleeves during the welding operation. However, we do not understand the procedure outlined in paragraph 3.6.6. of the RFQ, which seems to require the use of a test sleeve to somehow determine the shrink fit. The shrink fit on these sleeves is normally determined by the elimination of the gap between the sleeve and backing strip while maintaining stresses below 16,000 psi in the sleeve. Please either expound on the use of a test sleeve, or allow it to be omitted from the requirements.

Reply to Contractor: If the shop can provide documentation on their experience with performing this procedure for Navy shafts such as a copy of the procedure to be used with a Navy QAR authorization signature then we can omit the test requirement.
 
4.) The sleeve welding procedure referenced in the RFQ specification is apparently a Shielded-Metal-Arc welding procedure. We have performed all split-sleeve installations to date using an approved Gas-Metal-Arc (GMAW) welding procedure (to Tech. Pub. 248), along with a Process Control Procedure which outlines the process of attaching and monitoring the strain gages, welding procedure to be used, peening technique, etc. We propose being able to use this procedure in lieu of the one specified in the RFQ.

Reply to Contractor:  As long as the correct filler is used the above procedure will be acceptable.
 
5.) We have a NAVSEA-approved welding procedure for welding MIL-S-23284 Class 1 and Class 2 shafting. The referenced shafts are MIL-S-23284, Class 3. The filler metal requirement for Class 3 shafting is the same as that for Classes 1 and 2. Will it be allowable to submit the PQR for Class 1 shafting with a specific procedure for welding the Class 3 shafting without qualification testing to Class 3 base material? Please note that we have queried some local marine welding sources and have found that they are also not qualified for Class 3 materials.

Reply to Contractor:  The Class 1 weld procedure can be used as long as the post-weld heat treatment temperature can be adjusted to meet the requirements of 2191 Table II.

<DESC>THE CURRENT RESPONSE DATE UNDER GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE ORIGINAL PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS CORRECTED TO 12/05/2007. Provide A/E Qualifications for construction of a Cardiology Step-Down Unit at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston, SC.  The required services shall include schematic design concept (15%) design development (60%), preparation of final construction documents including cost estimate for the 100% level, selected post construction period service, post construction as-builts, and other task related to these services for Project 534-08-109.  The proposed construction is to renovate some respiratory and pulmonary space next to the Cardiology Department and the Cardiac Cath Labs into an appropriate Cardiology Step Down Unit for Cardiology patients.  The primary intent is to have a unit that can support the utilization of the cardiology catherization room and possibly other heart procedures that would need a step down recovery area before release to the surgical/medical wards and/or to outpatient surgical areas.  A nurse's station (and/or area/alcove), recovery area/rooms for the cardiology patients with medical gas, electrical power (both normal and emergency), lighting, telemetry, data lines, etc. will be part of the design and determination of the layout for the area.  Secondary intents would be to be able to utilize the area as a possible swing space for either MICU or SICU during a possible renovation of the areas and also to be utilized as an Ambulatory Care Surgery Observations area if excess capacity might exist.  Meetings with Nursing and medical staff for programming (exact determination of the space layout and resultant engineering needs will be required.  Project will also require the coordination of relocation of some of the cardiology functions within approximately the same area as the step down units.  Exit determination will be during the programming meetings, but it appears that the exact stress test area, EKG reading rooms, and holters  scanning area will have to be relocated within the same general space.  Approximately 4,000 SF of space will be renovated.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.   Consideration is limited to concerns located within a 200 mile radius of VAMC, Charleston, SC.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541310.  This notice is issued subject to the availability of funds and is not a request for proposal.  Interested firms who posses experience in this type of design and renovation may submit three (3) copies of an SF-330 located at the following website:  http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF  to Sandy Mulligan, Contracting Officer, 109 Bee Street, Charleston, SC  29401 not later than 3:00 PM eastern time, December 5, 2007.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.  SOURCE:  FedBizOpps Synopsis http://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/ChaVAMC/VAMCCO80220/VA-247-08-RP-0066/listing.html

<DESC>--  AMENDMENT 0001A  --  This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with small businesses.  The NAICS solicited is 541380  Testing Laboratories.  The small business size standard for NAICS 54 1380 is $11.0 million.  The BPAs duration will be for a period of one (1) year and may be extended in one (1) year increments, not to exceed 5 years.  The tests to be performed and the test methods to be used are as shown on Table 1 (Attachment A).  The e stablishment of BPAs does not imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the BPA holders.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered.  The establishment of BP As does not justify purchasing from only one source.  The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement.  Price reasonableness will be determined by competing BPA calls among BPA holders.  If, for a particular purchase greater than the mic ro-purchase threshold, there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the Contracting Officer shall solicit quotations from other sources and make the purchase as appropriate.  Orders may be placed for USAERDC, Environme ntal Chemistry Branch, Vicksburg, MS.  BPA holders will be selected based on successful past performance of same/similar services, and business experience.  Responses to this announcement must include past performance information and business experience to  include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, contract numbers, as well as a description of the services provided.   Past Performance Questionnaire  For all contacts identified, a Past Performance Questionnaire must be completed and submitted.   Past Performance Questionnaire is available upon request by email.  Point of contact is Cynthia Sims at Cynthia.L.Sims@mvk02.usace.army.mil.  A solicitation will not be issued.   Responses to this announcement must be received not later than 30 November 2007, 4 :00 p.m. central standard time, to be considered.  All respondents must have an active registration at Central Contractor Registration www.ccr.gov.  Responses shall be mailed to Cynthia Sims, USAED, ERDC Contracting Office, Vicksburg, 4155 Clay Street, Vic ksburg, MS  39183-3435.  Facsimile offers shall not be accepted.

<DESC>--  AMENDMENT 0001  --  This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with small businesses.  The NAICS solicited is 541380  Testing Laboratories.  The small business size standard for NAICS 541 380 is $11.0 million.  The BPAs duration will be for a period of one (1) year and may be extended in one (1) year increments, not to exceed 5 years.  The tests to be performed and the test methods to be used are as shown on Table 1 (Attachment A).  The es tablishment of BPAs does not imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the BPA holders.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered.  The establishment of BPA s does not justify purchasing from only one source.  The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement.  Price reasonableness will be determined by competing BPA calls among BPA holders.  If, for a particular purchase greater than the micr o-purchase threshold, there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the Contracting Officer shall solicit quotations from other sources and make the purchase as appropriate.  Orders may be placed for USAERDC, Environmen tal Chemistry Branch, Vicksburg, MS.  BPA holders will be selected based on successful past performance of same/similar services, and business experience.  Responses to this announcement must include past performance information and business experience to include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, contract numbers, as well as a description of the services provided.   Past Performance Questionnaire  For all contacts identified, a Past Performance Questionnaire must be completed and submitted.   Past P erformance Questionnaire is available upon request by email.  Point of contact is Cynthia Sims at Cynthia.L.Sims@mvk02.usace.army.mil.  A solicitation will not be issued.   Responses to this announcement must be received not later than 30 November 2007, 4: 00 p.m. central standard time, to be considered.  All respondents must have an active registration at Central Contractor Registration www.ccr.gov.  Responses shall be mailed to Cynthia Sims, USAED, ERDC Contracting Office, Vicksburg, 4155 Clay Street, Vick sburg, MS  39183-3435.  Facsimile offers shall not be accepted.

<DESC>Request for Information - Providers of Human Factors Research Support

1.0	SUBJECT

This is a Request for Information (RFI) on Providers of Human Factors Research Support for the U. S. Department of Transportation. 

2.0	DESCRIPTION

The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is seeking information on Human Factors research conducted across the various modes of transportation, and the organizations that can provide this support. 

This request has been initiated by the DOT Human Factors Coordinating Committee (HFCC).   HFCC was established by the Secretary of Transportation in 1991 to become the focal point for human factors issues within DOT.   DOT needs coordinated human factors research to provide synergy across modes on topical areas, permit large research efforts that modes cannot support individually, as well as to advocate for the importance of human factors research in transportation system solutions. By its continuing support to HFCC, DOT recognizes that an emphasis on human factors in transportation systems is imperative to meet the Departmental safety and efficiency goals.  HFCC membership is composed of representation from the Office of the Secretary and from each of the DOT administrations that have human factors programs.

HFCC is requesting information on organizations conducting human factors research in order to raise awareness of organizations capable of performing research, the scope of available research, as well as to encourage cross modal communication and to sensitize DOT modes to the importance of incorporating human factors considerations in its projects.   

3.0	INFORMATION REQUESTED

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:
a.  A description of your company, products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  
b.  Your capabilities in conducting human factors research across the various transportation modes.
c.  Your equipment and facilities that would be available for human factors research
d.  Areas of staff expertise.  
e.  Your previous human-factors-related projects sponsored by DOT.
f.  Concepts for how human factors research, in general, and within your organization could be demonstrated interactively in an information exchange meeting.

4.0	INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETINGS

DOT will hold an industry exchange meeting to discuss the information requested through this RFI.  DOT will also consider additional meetings as necessary to meet and address special needs of potential respondents.

All interested potential respondents must provide their contact information via electronic mail to the Government personnel identified in Section 6.0 RFI in order to receive the meeting details or make arrangements.

5.0	DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned, are not considered offers, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.   The Government is not responsible to the Responder for any expenses associated with preparing and submitting a response to this RFI.   The Responders are solely responsible for any and all expenses.

6.0	CONTACT INFORMATION

Responders are requested to submit information via electronic mail in Microsoft Office format with five copies any supplemental hardcopy materials such as brochures, pamphlets, and other published documents by 4:00 PM on January 25, 2008 to Arnold Konheim and Clementine Caudle-Wright as follows:

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.     THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.     THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).     The 30th Contracting Squadron, Vandenberg AFB, CA is in the process of conducting market research to determine the existence of potential sources to perform Base-Wide Painting and Corrosion Control at Vandenberg AFB, CA.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238320-Painting and Wall Covering Contractors.     The contract type is planned to be a single award, firm-fixed-price requirements contract.  The performance period is planned to include a twelve-month basic year, with four twelve-month option periods.  The estimated price range of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

	The contractor will provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, labor, transportation, supplies, supervision, plans and other items and services necessary to accomplish the base wide corrosion control and protective coatings requirements at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB).  The contractor will perform corrosion control and apply protective coatings on all completed and partially-completed exteriors of facilities and supporting structures, including but not limited to propane tanks, water tanks, generators, transformers, towers and roofs, to match existing color(s) and finishes.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Logistics Support Center (NLSC), located in Kansas City, MO  intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for fifteen (15) electronic enclosure assemblies, NSN:  5998-01-520-7208, ASN:  S100-2MT6-3A2 on a sole source basis from C. C. Lynch & Associates, Inc, Pass Christian, MS based on the following: 1) The All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gage (AWPAG) is an unattended sensor, operating continuously under the control of the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).  The sensor measures precipitation by weighing total accumulation and compensates for evaporation and wind-induced vibration effects via an internal algorithm.  While the technology for AWPAG is Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), the sensor was modified for ASOS implementation in 2003.  It is clear that the Electronics Enclosure Assembly was designed as a full developmental effort to satisfy the needs of the Government and it appears that the Government has unlimited rights to the technical data used to physically integrate the AWPAG into the ASOS; 2) A complete escrow drawing package is available for all hardware components, however, the Government is not able to effectively segregate the proprietary data from publicly owned data without an engineering effort to prepare derivative works; 3) Without appropriate drawings and specifications for the AWPAG Electronics Enclosure Assembly, the unique design characteristics are unable to be duplicated on the open market; 4) Any unexpected variations in performance may damage the sensor and/or affect the operational output of precipitation data, potentially adversely impacting aviation and the climactic record; 5) Existing hardware repair parts for this system are now stocked by part number at the NLSC; 6) Design changes will result in considerable and unnecessary expense to the Government in logistics and maintenance; 7) Additional funding is not available for an engineering effort to prepare derivative works and the Government sees no reason to allocate funding for that additional task;
 
Delivery is expected prior to 01/15/2008.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide an assembly that provides the exact form, fit and function of that described herein.  2) Demonstrated past experience in completion of work that is similar or the same as that described herein.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
?	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
?	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
?	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
?	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
?	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
?	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.
III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent?s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<DESC>C-130 Cockpit Armor Attachment Improvement

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to explore commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies to provide a single installation solution for C-130 cockpit armor kits.  Through this RFI, the US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is requesting information concerning mature technologies which meet these requirements:  


1.	AMC has a need to improve/replace the current armor attachment system for C-130 aircraft. Currently the aircraft armor is attached using Velcro?.  Due to dust, the Velcro?s? adhesion is reduced and the fit is compromised.  Portions of the interior cockpit vertical pieces may separate or dangle loosely from their Velcro? attachments. 

2.	In the wheel well of the aircraft, weight of the armor is a larger factor.  The weight of the armor plates, cause the Velcro? to sag and separate from its attachment.  This separation may cause the armor plate to rub against the nose wheel tire when the landing gear is retracted in the wheel well.

3.	For further information and/or pictures contact Capt. John Yerger (609) 754-7608 john.yerger@mcguire.af.mil.


This RFI may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration or purchase of products that respondents indicate will meet the requirements of this request.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request. 
NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS:  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS:  Product information may be submitted until close of business Wednesday, 15 January 2008.  White papers should not exceed five pages and should include cost estimates.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in Microsoft Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the Air Mobility Warfare Center Battlelab at battlelab@mcguire.af.mil.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS CAPT JOHN YERGER.     Capt Yerger can be contacted at (609) 754-7608 or john.yerger@mcguire.af.mil.
Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.     GENERAL AMB INFORMATION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  The AMB strongly encourages partnering with companies to complete demonstrations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), cooperative agreements, or bailment agreements, but does have a small budget to purchase COTS/GOTS-derived hardware.

GENERAL RFI INFORMATION:  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Mental Health
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health intends to conduct negotiations on a sole - source basis with the University of Michigan for a multi-year contract to provide a variety of assessments on global mental health issues, using the World Mental Health Survey (WMHS) database.  The WMHS database is not publicly available and can not be accessed by 3rd parties. The University of Michigan serves as the WMHS Data Collection Coordination Centre, and is thus in a unique position to provide access to this dataset and to provide first-hand expertise in analyzing the data. 

The WMHS dataset is a collection of nationally or regionally representative population surveys conducted in 26 countries. These data are the only existing source of accurate cross-national information about the prevalence and correlates of mental, substance, and behavioral disorders, in both developed and developing countries. It is also the only source of consistent, population-based cross-national information needed to measure quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the preferred outcome for cost-effectiveness research in health care; specifically, it includes 'standard gamble','time tradeoff', and 'visual analogue scale' measures of respondents' quality of life, as well as unprecedented detail on morbidity and disability. These data will allow NIMH to develop, test and compare different methods of evaluating the impact on quality of life of different mental health and medical conditions; and to relate epidemiology and health care use with country-level measures of health system capacity, spending, and other relevant indicators, e.g., to identify potential policy 'levers' for addressing mental health burden.

The objectives of this contract are to: 1) Update evidence on the burden of mental illness and other disease by implementing and comparing alternative measurement methods; 2) Identify major areas of unmet need for mental health care globally, along with individual and environmental correlates of mental illness and mental health treatment; 3) Develop a research agenda of treatments, delivery strategies, outreach methods, policy planning and implementation, financing and human resource development aimed at reducing unmet needs for mental health treatment globally; and 4) Help identify specific 'leverage points' for educating key stakeholder groups, focusing/targeting public awareness and other types of interventions, and ultimately facilitate access to effective mental health treatment across developed and developing countries. 

The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the University of Michigan) is: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.

This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals, nor is an RFP available. Responsible sources that believe they posses the expertise and capabilities identified above should submit to the Contracting Officer, by the closing date listed above, their proposal and supporting information in the format they choose.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIMH. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>A -- State Mental Health Programs, Policies, and Epidemiology
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health intends to conduct negotiations on a sole - source basis with the NASMHPD Research Institute (NRI) for a multi-year contract to improve data resources and knowledge regarding state-level mental health spending, health care use, epidemiology and unmet need. The mental health agencies of all 50 states, 4 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia are represented by a single organization, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD, and the NASMHPD Research Institute (NRI: http://www.nri-inc.org/) is the only existing source of cross-state data on state mental health programs from all US states and territories, and NRI's databases are not publicly available. Also, NRI is the only organization with established relationships with all (or even most) states for collecting and analyzing mental health-related data. As such, NRI is the only viable source for conducting this work. 

The objectives of this contract are to 1) Develop an initial assessment of the scope and quality of data currently collected by NRI for conducting policy research, and identify priorities for strengthening and extending these data; 2) Conduct cross-state analyses of mental health-related costs, service use, epidemiology and unmet need across multiple relevant state agencies and programs, including analysis of different levels of geographic variation; 3) Work with states to build an initial consortium of states willing to pool mental-health related data for ongoing policy evaluation, and a framework for such pooling; and 4) Develop pooled data from multiple states, for potential use by states for research and policy evaluation. 

The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the NRI) is: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.

<SUBJECT>A -- Engaging Large Employers Regarding Evidence-Based Mental Health Treatment
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health intends to conduct negotiations on a sole - source basis with the National Business Group on Health (NBGH: http://www.businessgrouphealth.org/) for a multi-year contract to engage large employers regarding their employees' mental health treatment and to encourage them to adopt/disseminate current evidence-based mental health practices. Through this contract, the NIMH seeks to engage the largest employers in the U.S. (i.e., Fortune 100/Fortune 500 companies), to identify their current practices regarding mental health and to engage them systematically regarding specific, business-focused steps to facilitate evidence-based practices and improve mental health treatment. 

The NBGH has unique capabilities for conducting this work. In particular, NBGH is the only national organization that specifically represents large employers on health care and health policy issues, and thus has a direct mandate both to solicit and represent the views of large employers and to engage them proactively regarding health and health care; and NBGH is the only health-focused organization whose membership includes a majority of Fortune 100 firms - overall, NBGH's membership directs health benefits for some 55 million Americans, i.e., approximately 1/3 of all Americans with employment-based health insurance. Thus NBGH is the sole organization with the access and mandate needed to conduct this work. 

The objectives of this contract are to: 1) Understand the current mental health benefits strategies within these companies, and their strategies for addressing other health/productivity issues; 2) Understand the receptivity of these large employers to initiating specific new strategies to improve mental health treatment and outcomes, and on barriers to change; 3) Study dissemination of evidence-based practice recommendations for improving mental health treatment and outcomes to individual large employers; and 4) Develop research reports on potential leverage points for engaging large employers, based the findings from the other activities in this contract. 

The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the National Business Group on Health) is: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1(b)(1) -- unique supplies or services available from only one source.

<DESC>IMI/CBT Industry Day The Project Manager Battle Command (PM BC) will host an Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI)/Computer-Based Training (CBT) Industry Day 11-12 Dec 07, at Gibbs Hall, Fort Monmouth, NJ.  Gibbs Hall is on the Fort Monmouth Sun Eagles Golf Course off of T inton Avenue in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. Description of Event   PM BC is hosting an IMI/CBT Industry Day 11-12 Dec 07.   Day One (11 Dec) will include Vendor displays and booths, if desired, Government Overview brief of current and potential requirements, and One-on-One 30-minute sessions for vendor presentations and q uestions to key Government officials.  Day Two (12 Dec) will continue One-on-One sessions until Noon.  Any additional One-on-One sessions not scheduled during these dates will be separately coordinated and scheduled the following week.   Day One (11 Dec 2007)  Full Day 0730  0845	Vendor / product booths setup for day one (Main Hall) 0900  1030	Overview Briefing / Open Forum in Small Conference Room 0900  1630	PM/PdM/PD Product Booths & Vendor Booths available 1100  1130	Lunch (Pizza) Optional (Donations Accepted) 1130  1700	One-on-One 30-minute blocks scheduled for individual vendor presentations  Small Conference Room Upstairs 1630  1700	Break down Product and Vendor Booths 1700		Conclude first day  Day Two (12 Dec 2007)  Half Day - morning only (No Product or Vendor Booths) 0830 - 1200	Continue vendor presentations to Govt Team as needed Background  In implementing the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process, there is a critical need to synchronize people, equipment, and training to create combat-ready forces.  Training must adequately address the requirements and be a sustainable, repeatable process  that can fulfill both programmed requirements and surging immediate requests for forces.  It is important for industry (vendors) to understand the evolving training requirements and for Government (PMs) representatives to be fully aware of the products/se rvices available from the vendors.   Purpose From the perspective of individual systems/Battlefield Functional Applications (BFAs), Army Battle Command System (ABCS) System of Systems (SoS), and/or PEO C3T Family of Systems (FoS), we need to identify currently available and evolving training and docu mentation products and service capabilities and technologies that will meet current and future training requirements for our programs.  Our training solutions must be adaptable to support platform based formal classrooms, as well as web based or IMI/CBT tr aining products.  They should be useable and modularized to support New Equipment Training, Collective Training, Sustainment Training, Institutional Training, and Self Paced Refresher training in support of continued troop rotations and to accommodate pers onnel turnover.  Our training community is open to new and evolving technologies, to assess how well they meet our evolving requirements, and to identify the opportunity for competitive solutions that might be considered to address future PEO C3T training support requirements.     IMI/CBT Industry Day is intended to provide an opportunity for vendors to showcase their training capabilities (encompassing their use of technologies, techniques, and instructional products); the Government to highlight training materials or capabilities currently in use or desired to support their systems; and for all participants to gain a better understanding of potential training requirements for PEO C3T FoS. One-on-One Sessions One-on-One sessions (individual vendor and Government Team) also will be offered and will start immediately after the Government Overview Briefing on the 11th and run to the end of the day.  They will be continued the following morning if required.  One-on -One sessions are limited to 30 minutes per company (25-minute presentation/discussion and 5-minute transition/set-up).  Vendors will be assigned sessions in the order registrations are  received.  If you are interested in a One-on-One session, please respond accordingly in the registration check list below.  If a company does not have the opportunity to participate in One-on-One sessions owing to time constraints, an alternative date wil l be offered for a future date to be coordinated between the Government and the company.  The conduct of these sessions is left up to whatever vendors feel will maximize their participation.  The time can be used to present their capabilities to a captive  Government audience and to discuss these capabilities in a closed/private session.  The time can be used to ask questions to better understand training support requirements for future planning.  The Government is not imposing a set agenda for each sessio n.  Projection equipment will be made available.       Intent of One-on-Ones: "	Increase industry understanding of Battle Command and PEO C3T training requirements "	Afford industry the opportunity to surface perceived issues and possible solutions "	Allow Government to hear industry response and comment in general terms "	Promote a Government and industry free exchange of ideas in the realm of training "	Enable Government and industry to better understand the needs of the Warfighter One-on-Ones Do Not:  "	Provide industry an opportunity to brief an intended proposal "	Provide for Government critique of potential offerors intended approach "	Constitute initiation of the negotiation process Driving Directions Take the Garden State Parkway to Exit 105 onto Hwy 36 East.  Get in Right lane.  Take jug-handle (sign to Fort Monmouth) on right immediately after first light.  This puts you on Hope Road going north.  Follow Hope Road to Tinton Avenue (3rd light) and tur n right.  The entrance to Gibbs Hall (Officers Club) and golf course is about one-half mile on the right. Registration Registration and attendance is limited to three people per company.

Day One (11 Dec 2007): Full Day 0730 to 0845	Vendor / product booths setup for day one (Main Hall) 0900 to 1030	Overview Briefing / Open Forum in Small Conference Room 0900 to 1630	PM/PdM/PD Product Booths & Vendor Booths available 1100 to 1130	Lunch (Pizza) Optional (Donations Accepted) 1130 to 1700	One-on-One 30-minute blocks scheduled for individual vendor presentations Small Conference Room Upstairs 1630 to 1700	Break down Product and Vendor Booths 1700		Conclude first day  Day Two (12 Dec 2007): Half Day - morning only (No Product or Vendor Booths) 0830 to 1200	Continue vendor presentations to Govt Team as needed Background.  In implementing the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process, there is a critical need to synchronize people, equipment, and training to create combat-ready forces.  Training must adequately address the requirements and be a sustainable, repea table process that can fulfill both programmed requirements and surging immediate requests for forces.  It is important for industry (vendors) to understand the evolving training requirements and for Government (PMs) representatives to be fully aware of th e products/services available from the vendors.   Purpose.  From the perspective of individual systems/Battlefield Functional Applications (BFAs), Army Battle Command System (ABCS) System of Systems (SoS), and/or PEO C3T Family of Systems (FoS), we need to identify currently available and evolving trainin g and documentation products and service capabilities and technologies that will meet current and future training requirements for our programs.  Our training solutions must be adaptable to support platform based formal classrooms, as well as web based or IMI/CBT training products.  They should be useable and modularized to support New Equipment Training, Collective Training, Sustainment Training, Institutional Training, and Self Paced Refresher training in support of continued troop rotations and to accomm odate personnel turnover.  Our training community is open to new and evolving technologies, to assess how well they meet our evolving requirements, and to identify the opportunity for competitive solutions that might be considered to address future PEO C3T  training support requirements.     IMI/CBT Industry Day is intended to provide an opportunity for vendors to showcase their training capabilities (encompassing their use of technologies, techniques, and instructional products); the Government to highlight training materials or capabilities currently in use or desired to support their systems; and for all participants to gain a better understanding of potential training requirements for PEO C3T FoS. One-on-One Sessions.  One-on-One sessions (individual vendor and Government Team) also will be offered and will start immediately after the Government Overview Briefing on the 11th and run to the end of the day.  They will be continued the following mornin g if required.  One-on-One sessions are limited to 30 minutes per company (25-minute presentation/discussion and 5-minute transition/set-up).  Vendors will be assigned sessions in the order registrations are received.  If you are interested in a One-on-One  session, please respond accordingly in the registration check list below.  If a company does not have the opportunity to participate in One-on-One sessions owing to time constraints, an alternative date will be offered for a future date to be coordinated between the Gover nment and the company.  The conduct of these sessions is left up to whatever vendors feel will maximize their participation.  The time can be used to present their capabilities to a captive Government audience and to discuss these capabilities in a close d/private session.  The time can be used to ask questions to better understand training support requirements for future planning.  The Government is not imposing a set agenda for each session.  Projection equipment will be made available.       Intent of One-on-Ones:  Increase industry understanding of Battle Command and PEO C3T training requirements; Afford industry the opportunity to surface perceived issues and possible solutions; Allow Government to hear industry response and comment in gener al terms; Promote a Government and industry free exchange of ideas in the realm of training; and Enable Government and industry to better understand the needs of the Warfighter. One-on-Ones Do Not: Provide industry an opportunity to brief an intended proposal; Provide for Government critique of potential offerors intended approach; and Constitute initiation of the negotiation process. Driving Directions: Take the Garden State Parkway to Exit 105 onto Hwy 36 East.  Get in Right lane.  Take jug-handle (sign to Fort Monmouth) on right immediately after first light.  This puts you on Hope Road going north.  Follow Hope Road to Tinton Avenue  (3rd light) and turn right.  The entrance to Gibbs Hall (Officers Club) and golf course is about one-half mile on the right. Registration: Registration and attendance is limited to three people per company.

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).     FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.

In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually.     You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov.     Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.     No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via the following URL https://www.FedTeDS.gov.     You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number and Your E-Mail Address.

Also, Beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.     Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.
FAR 52.212-2  EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factor.  The following non-cost factor shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement.  Then the quotation will be evaluated for the lowest price.

1.  Factor 1   Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the chamber survey meters with standard chambers in accordance with all stated product specifications.  

?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.			


NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is December 5, 2007 @ 2:00PM local time.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP), Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), Contracting Office, located at 655 Fairton-Millville Road, Fairton, New Jersey, 08320  is requesting quotations for replacing well pump controls located in the Federal Correctional Institution, Fairton, New Jersey.  All work will be performed at the FCI located at 655 Fairton-Millville Road, Fairton, New Jersey 08320.

STATEMENT OF WORK AND SPECIFICATIONS:

INTRODUCTION

	            Federal Correctional Institution Fairton New Jersey is accepting bids for work to be performed on its domestic water system controls. The contractor will be responsible for furnishing all equipment, materials, technical expertise, labor, transportation, tools and any other supplies required to meet requirements of this Statement of Work. If there is any damage to the property due to negligence, the contractor will take sole responsibility for all repairs. Any spillage or leakage clean up costs will be the responsibility of the contractor. The Federal Correctional Institution reserves the right to request proof of proper disposal of any and all hazardous waste generated during this work.

PROJECT LOCATION

All work will be performed at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fairton, located at 655 Fairton-Millville Road, Fairton, New Jersey 08320.

SUMMARY
Buildings and Facilities project 2KS was established to perform repairs on the water system controls located in the domestic water pump-house at FCI Fairton. The system consists of four electric pumps (one 10 HP and three 20 HP) which are vertically mounted and joined at a common header. Currently, the system is run manually, whereas pumps come on successively in response to decreasing water pressure, in turn the pumps shut down in the same fashion as water pressure demands are met. The old system with its frequent on/off control of pumps, caused them to fail, most likely due to over stressing/overheating from repeated high startup current conditions.  For this reason, and in an effort to minimize water pressure fluctuations, a variable-drive, on-demand system is desired. Moreover, due to different levels of water usage at various times of the day, it is not cost effective to have two 20hp pumps running in the early morning hours creating a higher than normal domestic water pressure condition. 
	
Note: Due to the necessity to maintain a supply of water at all times to the institution, the work may need to be done in a manner where at least one of the pumps remains in service while the others are being worked on.

Desired Features

General system features shall include:
	?	Electronic monitoring and display of domestic water pressure that includes a new panel/display box, which will be moisture/corrosion resistant due to the wet pump house environment.
			 
	?	Variable speed drive, on-demand pump utilization scheme using the existing four pumps.
			
	?	Appropriate pump motor startup components, to be located in new panel/display box.

Panel/display features:
Pump on/off status.
		
System water pressure.

Fault/pump failure conditions.

Pump Failure Feature
The system/display should be able to detect whether each pump is actually energized and properly pumping water.  In the event of a pump failure the system, as part of its on-demand pump on/off scheme, should have the capability to ?ignore? or ?skip? the failed pump(s), and energize the next operating pump in its place.  In addition, the controller should visually and audibly indicate to the operator any failed pump(s).

QUALITY ASSURANCE
The work will be performed by a contractor who regularly engages in the business of maintenance and repair of water control apparatuses as required in this statement of work.

SCOPE

During the repairs, all work must be coordinated correctly. Due to the necessity to maintain a supply of water at all times to the institution, the work must be done in a manner where at a minimum one of the pumps  remain in operation while the others are being worked on. 

Removal of existing control box/panel/displays. 

Removal of existing non-functioning system components (e.g. pressure switches).

Installation of any electrical wiring and conduit in support of the new control system.	Once the vessel is cleaned, it must be sanitized before it is placed back into service. 

Installation of above-described variable drive, on-demand pump control system.

Replacement of existing pump motor startup components with compatible relays and starters.

Post-installation system check to ensure proper operation and achievement of all specified design objectives.

TERMS

All personnel will be required to pass background checks before starting work. 
Normal work hours will be 7:30 to 4:00 p.m. All work will be accomplished during normal hours, unless prior arrangements are made in writing between the institution and the contractor. 
No work will be performed on Saturday and Sunday and all Federal Holiday?s unless agreed upon in writing.
MSDS sheets will be required for chemicals that are used on the site.
The contractor is responsible for all debris and trash. 
The contractor may have a dumpster on the site if necessary.
Rest rooms will be available for use.
Electrical power if needed is available from existing buildings.
A staging area for material and supplies will be designated by Facilities.
The performance period for this contract is sixty (60)		calendar days.

SUBMITTALS
Submittals will be made in accordance with these specifications and prior to the ordering of any materials.  Submit two copies to FCI Fairton.  FCI Fairton will then forward these to the Northeast Regional Office for approval. 
 
COMPLETION
Upon completion of the work, remove excess debris, materials, equipment, apparatus, tools and the like and leave premises clean, neat and orderly


EVALUATION FACTORS:
The Government intends to make a single award, to the lowest technically acceptable offeror meeting the required specifications.
