<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

A critical area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) is the development and deployment of technologies to protect the nation’s cyber infrastructure including the Internet and other critical infrastructures that depend on computer systems for their mission. The goals of the DHS HSARPA CSRD program are to:
•	Perform the underlying research and development (R&D) to improve existing deployed technologies and to ensure the security of new emerging systems;
•	Develop new and enhanced technologies for the detection of, prevention of, and response to cyber attacks on the nation’s infrastructure.  
•	Transfer these technologies into the national infrastructure as a matter of urgency.
To achieve these goals, the HSARPA CSRD BAA 04-17 solicits proposals that address one of the seven technical topic areas (TTAs) described in the BAA.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price Contract to procure Airborne Solid State Recorders for simultaneous audio/video/databus recording and ancillary equipment as required by the Operational Test and Evaluation Force in Norfolk, Virginia on a planned sole-source basis with ENERTEC America, 100 Deerfield Point, Alpharetta, GA 30004.   This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The delivery date will be within 40 weeks from the date of award.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334511 (Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing).  Contract line items are as follows:  CLIN 0001, Airborne Solid State Recorder, part number VS2200, 4 each; CLIN 0002, 200 GB Removable Hard Drive Memory Cartridge, part number DC2200, 4 each; CLIN 0003, Suspended Mounting Tray for VS2200 Helicopter Horizontal Mount, part number CA 5220-20, 4 each; CLIN 0004, Ground Video/Data Replay Station, part number VS2300-5, 1 each; CLIN 0005, Software License for MIL-STD-1553B, part number VL2750, 1 each; CLIN 0006, Raytheon TSCxp Wide FOV Infrared Cameras, part number 4978520-009, 5 each; and CLIN 0007, Sony Analog Color Cameras, part number XC-555, 15 each.
 
This requirement will be negotiated on a planned sole source basis with ENERTEC America for the following reasons.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has determined that the only acceptable airborne recording equipment is designed to read the 1553 databus only and that any equipment with the capability to write to the 1553 databus, whether or not that capability can be disabled, is not acceptable.  ENERTEC America’s airborne recording equipment is designed to “read only” the 1553 databus.  In addition, the 18th Flight Test Squadron, Hurlburt Field, Florida has already procured  ENERTEC America’s recording equipment and has submitted a Flight Clearance Package to NAVAIR.  And, the V-22 Integrated Test Team at Patuxent River, Maryland will also be procuring ENERTEC America’s recording equipment.  Since the testing of the Osprey aircraft is a joint effort among the 18th Flight Test Squadron, the V-22 Integrated Test Team, and the Operational Test and Evaluation Force, it is in the best interest of the Government to procure equipment that is compatible with what has already been procured and which has already been cleared by NAVAIR.

The solicitation and any subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http: www.fedbizopps.gov as this office no longer issues hard-copy solicitations.  By submitting a proposal, the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.   Note 22 applies.

Each litter will be in an individual museum jar stored in 70% ethanol/glycerol, ready to be examined  for skeletal anatomy. Because of the known effects of boric acid on skeletal development, EPA is particularly interested in effects on the axial skeleton.  Line Item 1 - Contractor will receive fetuses from EPA (all fetuses in each of  63 Sprague-Dawley rat litters) in 70% ethanol/glycerol.  Each  litter will be identified with a number, but the individual fetuses within the litters will not be uniquely identified.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a sole source modification to contract DCA200-97-D-0054 with AT&T Communications, Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182, to procure video teleconference hub equipment to support  Combatant Commander(s) and their operations in CONUS and OCONUS.  AT&T is currently under contract to provide network and hub operations for DISN Video Services (DVS) via the DISN Video Services-Global (DVS-G) contract.  To maintain critical warfighter situational awareness via the DVS tool and ultimately operational readiness across the global video spectrum, disruption of DVS-G services cannot occur.  DoD currently uses Video Teleconferencing (VTC)to conduct daily operations in support of real-time worldwide missions to include the war on terrorism, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Combatant Commander(s) have determined that secure VTC is a critical tool for Command and Control of Forces.  Loss of VTC capability would seriously affect current and future combat operations.  The DISA DVS Service Manager’s office has determined AT&T must perform this requirement for the following reasons:  The equipment supporting the existing AT&T architecture has become manufacturer discontinued making it impossible to further expand the hub capacity.  There is a requirement to satisfy the surge in urgent requirements to meet Combatant Commander(s) on-demand conferencing. This requirement will be satisfied with a series of  Combatant Command(s)mini-hubs using state of the art technology, that will be backwardly compatible with the existing equipment.  The mini-hubs at the Combatant Command(s) that will be managed through the central DVS-G operations center must be interfaced with the worldwide AT&T DVS service.  The existing infrastructure must be bridged with a growing population of IP based Video Teleconferencing Facilities to match the movement of the customer base toward IP based video.  Additionally, the mini-hubs procured through this effort will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) on the follow-on DVS II contract. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO REVISE BAA TOPIC AREA #2.  AS A RESULT, THE BAA IS RE-ISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-04-MDA-BAA MODIFICATION 03.  
The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capabilities or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, the Deputy for Advanced Systems (MDA/AS) established the Advanced Systems Innovation Cell (ASIC) to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  The ASIC team consists of subject matter experts tasked with evaluating new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The ASIC seeks new and inventive concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following nine technology areas: 

(1)	Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Transmit/receive modules, Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; and Passive RF Systems; 
(2)	 Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Passive EO/IR Systems including ideas and concepts for IR materials and FPAs that enable high performance passive EO/IR systems that are large format, have multicolor capability, are manufacturable, producible, low cost and have capability to extend to VLWIR operating at temperatures higher than 35° Kelvin, Read-out electronics, Lethality Mechanisms; Laser Imaging with High Frame Rates, Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) testing of Multi-/Hyper-Spectral Sensors, HWIL testing of LADAR systems in a Thermal Vacuum Environment, test of ground, air, space, sea-based operations (all wavelengths will be considered); 
(3)	Mathematics and Computer Science including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Decision Systems, Estimation, Prediction, Homing Navigation, Data Fusion, Pattern Recognition, Identification, Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion and Distributed Systems for Scene Generation;

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (no more than five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .PDF file) to the point of contact listed below.  White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information.  In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government’s rights in technical data which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper.

MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighted equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offerors’ capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35. 016).  White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until January 31, 2006.  Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete.  The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.   Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2004 through FY 2006.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award.

Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in Albuquerque, New Mexico intends to contract for engineering services to prepare studies, develop preliminary and final designs, and provide construction support services for the Heating Systems Modernization (HSM) project.  Placement of a contract is subject to Agency approval.

Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin company, for the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  HSM is a proposed federal line item construction project.  The purpose of the HSM project is to abandon the steam/condensate distribution system within Technical Area I and surrounding areas, decommission, decontaminate and demolish the central steam plant and related fuel oil storage and distribution system and replace the central system with a local boiler system and domestic hot water system tailored to the individual buildings currently served by the central system.  In general, the goals of the project are to:

•Replace the existing central steam system with local (building or buildings specific) boiler heating systems.
•Install domestic hot water equipment to service the needs of the affected buildings.
•Install new gas utility piping to support the new local systems.
•Decommission, decontaminate and demolish the existing central steam plant and associate fuel oil storage and piping system.
•Decontaminate the steam pits associated with the steam distribution system and abandon in place.
•Accomplish all of the above with no or minimal impact on the building occupants.

The estimated construction value of the project is roughly $50 million.

The engineering and design effort will be performed under a Firm, Fixed Price contract and will provide the following elements:
1. Studies - Design investigations will need to be conducted to establish overall concepts for the preliminary and final design stages.  These studies will include:
•Domestic water heating optimization
•Boiler optimization 
•Boiler manufacturer pre-qualification 
•Gas distribution system 
•Construction package identification 
•Steam system step-down plan 

2.Preliminary Design Phase - Designs for each item of scope will be prepared that incorporate extensive investigation of the current record drawings and physical locations, taking into account the results of the studies identified above.  Each design will include:
•Full identification of removals in each building (removal drawings).

The M816 candle shall produce a minimum  infrared light of 50 Watts/Steradian (within wavelength 0.75 to 0.95 microns)  and a maximum of 400 candelas visible light. The candle shall burn for a  minimum of 60 seconds in the air. The candle case shall be cylindrical and  shall have a diameter of less than 2.782 inch and a maximum length of 5.102  inches.  During cartridge launch, the candle will experience a maximum setback  of 12,000 G.  At a predetermined time during the flight of the cartridge, the  fuze will function and shall ignite the candle with the flash produced by the  black powder (4.9 grams) in the fuze. The fuze activation will produce a  maximum of approximately 1,000 PSI pushing the candle towards the tail cone  direction and thereby pushing the candle and parachute assembly out of the  cartridge.  During this parachute deployment, the candle will experience a  maximum setback of 900 G. (This is equivalent to a snatching force of 2000  pounds or less).  This force tries to pull the illuminant mix out of the candle  case.  Both M816 and M853A1 candle shall be able to withstand all the forces  specified here. 120mm Cartridge Descriptions and Candle Assembly Performance  Parameters: The M930 and M983 are fin stabilized illuminating Mortar Cartridges  which have a body bodies, consisting of a steel front and a rear body tubes.

The parachute is contained in the rear body and is connected to the  swivel assembly of the candle case which contains the illuminant mix. The  weight of both M930 and M983 candle assemblies shall be approximately 3.9  pounds each. The M930 candle shall produce a minimum visible light of 1 million  candelas and shall burn for a minimum of 50 seconds in the air. The M983 candle  shall produce a minimum infrared light of 75 Watts/Steradian (within wavelength  0.6 to 0.9 microns) and a maximum of 400 candelas of visible light. The candle  shall burn for a minimum of 50 seconds in the air.  The candle case shall be  cylindrical and shall have a diameter of less than 3.66 inches and a maximum  length of 5.24 inches.  During launch, the candle will experience a maximum  setback of 12,000 G.  At a predetermined time during the flight of the  cartridge, the fuze will function and shall ignite the candle with the flash  produced by the black powder in the fuze and the additional black powder in the  plastic container adjacent to the fuze (total of approximately 17.9 grams). The  fuze activation will produce a maximum of 4000 PSI pushing the candle towards  direction of the rear body and a loaded spring will push the candle and the  parachute out of the rear body.  During this parachute deployment, the candle  will experience a maximum setback of 1200 G. (This is equivalent to a snatching  force of 4000 pounds or less).

<DESC>This notice is a  Market Survey. The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential technologies/companies capable of providing  a lubricous coating for critical small arms weapon components to eliminate the  need for wet lubrication.  Currently, most weapon parts are steel coated with  hard chrome or phosphate and maintained with wet lubrication.  This potential  coating is expected to function without need for external lubrication in  adverse conditions to include:  sand, dust, extreme cold (-65 degrees F),  extreme heat (defined below), rain, mud, salt water,  Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) decontamination solvents, etc.  The maximum  operating temperature is dependent upon the weapon component in question.  As  such, interested firms should indicate the maximum service temperature of their  coating.  As a minimum, the Army is interested in a coating that has a maximum  service temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit and would prefer a service  temperature of at least 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  Furthermore, the following  characteristics should be addressed as to how they well they perform with  respect to hard chrome and phosphate:  1) corrosion protection, 2) abrasive and  sliding wear resistance, 3) adhesion to substrate, 4) coefficient of friction,  and 5) coefficient of thermal expansion.  Interested firms that feel they are  capable of supplying any of the above services are invited to indicate their  interest by providing specifications, brochures, and/or drawings within four  (4) weeks of the date of this notice to the U.S. Army, ARDEC, ATTN:  David C.C.  Mao, AMSRD-AAR-AEW-M(D), Bldg. 7, Picatinny, NJ 07806.  Contact David C.C. Mao  at 973 724 2308, e-mail dmaio@pica.army.mil, for any technical questions that  you may have regarding the requirements.  This is a market survey for  information only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an  obligation on the part of the US Government.  The US Government does not intend  to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for  information solicited.  The information you provide will only be utilized by  the US Army in developing its acquisition approach for future equipment buys. Provide information by October 1, 2004, 3:30 PM, LOCAL TIME.

<ARCHDATE>11152004
<CONTACT>Edward Lew, 212.264.7740
<DESC>The New York District Corps of Engineers is seeking from the industry information and availability regarding TAPERED steel piles that must meet the following specific requirements and salient characteristics: tapered form, cross-sectional area, secti on modulus, and 50 ksi hot-rolled steel.  The Tapered steel piles will be used to construct an A-FRAME ANCHORAGE UNIT. An A-frame anchorage unit as defined for the purposes of this project, shall consist of a single concrete-filled tapered steel compressio n pile, driven at a batter toward the Passaic River and two concrete-filled tapered steel tension piles, driven at an opposite batter of the compression pile. The compression pile is situated between the two tension piles, effectively fashioning a tripod.  Tapered steel piles are necessary because the present design specifications required the highest values of these parameters to adequately sustain the compression and tension anchorage loads; they have the highest KHC - ratio of horizontal to vertical effe ctive stress side of element when in compression, plus, they have the highest KHT - ratio of horizontal to vertical effective stress side of element when in tension.  The Gov't. issues this survey to determine if the industry has any available alternative/ substitute piles to those comparable to the piles known in the industry as Tapertube Piles that shall meet the aforementioned requirements.  All questions and/or responses shall be forwarded to Ed Lew, via e-mail at edward.t.lew@usace.army.mil by the due d ate as identified.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is offering commercial licensing opportunities for the following patents and patent application.  Licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the patents and patent application in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  

US Pat. No. 6,194,769  “Sensor Devices Based on Field-Structured Composites,” A new class of sensor devices comprising field-structured conducting composites and comprising a textured distribution of conducting magnetic particles is disclosed.  The conducting properties of such field-structured materials can be precisely controlled during fabrication so as to exhibit a large change in electrical conductivity when subject to any environmental influence which changes the relative volume fraction.  Influences which can be so detected include: stress, strain, shear, temperature change, humidity, magnetic field, electromagnetic radiation, and the presence or absence of certain chemicals.  This behavior can be made the basis for a wide variety of sensor devices.

US Pat. No. 6,290,868 “Field-Structured Material Media and Methods for Synthesis Thereof,” The present application is directed to a new class of composite materials, called field-structured composite (FSC) materials, which comprise an ordered aggregate structure made of magnetic particles suspended in a nonmagnetic medium, and to a new class of processes for their manufacture.  FSC materials have much potential for application, including use in chemical, optical, environmental, and mechanical sensors.

US Pat. No 6,391,393 “Method for making field-structured memory materials,” A method of forming a dual-level memory material using field structured materials.  The field structured materials are formed from a dispersion of ferromagnetic particles in a polymerizable liquid medium, such as a urethane acrylate-based photopolymer, which is applied as a film to a support and then exposed in selected portions of the film to an applied magnetic or electric field.  The field can be applied either uniaxially or biaxially at field strengths up to 150 G or higher to form the field structured materials.  After polymerizing the field-structure materials, a magnetic field can be applied to selected portions of the polymerized field-structured material to yield a dual-level memory materials on the support, wherein the dual-level memory material supports read-and-write binary data memory and write once, ready many memory.

US Pat. Appl. Ser. No., 10/354,254 “Method Of Using Triaxial Magnetic Fields For Making Particle Structures,” Composite material structures, including clusters, particle foams, and fluid dynamic vortice structures, are formed from magnetic particle suspensions subjected to simultaneous application of magnetic fields along three orthogonal axes, with at least two of the field components  oscillating and with the permeability of the composite material particles  greater than that of the solubilizing liquid.

<SUBJECT>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF COMMERCIAL GPS
<DESC>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF COMMERCIAL GPS Commercial GPS units are quickly proliferating on both civilian and military vessels plying the world’s waterways.  As a result, our dependency on commercial GPS technology is also proliferating, and increasing the possibility of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and damage to these units.  An on-going investigation by the United States Navy (USN) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) has determined that many commercially available GPS that employ active antenna electronics are susceptible to high power radar emissions.  Ironically, the use of higher power radars on the world’s military vessels is also increasing, furthering the possibility of interference and damage. At this time, separation distances required to avoid interference and potential antenna damage can be in excess of one half nautical mile.  The USCG has received numerous reports from commercial maritime operators, both domestically and internationally, concerning GPS antenna damage.  The USCG Maritime Liaison Office (MARLO) Bahrain has published an internationally released Advisory Bulletin 02-01 titled Global Positioning System (GPS) Interference Advisory based on these reports. The United States Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) located in Dahlgren, Virginia, in support of the USCG is currently planning high power radar susceptibility testing of commercially available GPS that employ active antenna electronics.  This testing will be used to determine the power level, duty cycle, modulations, and frequencies that will cause the performance of GPS to degrade, lose satellite lock, or become permanently damaged.  The GPS susceptibilities will be recorded for out-of-band emissions.  These GPS susceptibility and vulnerability test results will be used to form the foundation of recommendations made to the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) for changing international performance standards of commercial GPS.  The goal is to ensure that the end users of commercial GPS products can operate at reasonable separation distances from offending ships or shore based emitters without the potential of electromagnetic interference and damage.  Identifying and adjusting the performance standards for GPS manufacturers would, in effect, change the design standards for commercial GPS that employ active antenna electronics.  Hardening these GPS would increase their ability to perform satisfactorily and survive in the presence of the most stressing of electromagnetic environments of the world’s various ships.  NSWCDD invites commercial GPS manufacturers to participate in this process.  The larger the test sample size, the more successful this effort will be.  Participating manufacturers will have the opportunity to review the test plan prior to the test and provide technical feedback, increasing the effective value of the effort.  Participating manufacturers will be required to provide two GPS antennas that incorporate active electronics and one receiver for each antenna model to be tested.  NSWCDD will not be liable for any damages to the provided equipment.  Equipment provided by manufacturers can be returned if prepaid shipping is provided by the manufacturer, otherwise GPS units will become the property of the US Government and will be disposed of in accordance with Federal Regulations.  Each participant will be required to execute a Bailment Agreement with NSWCDD formally agreeing to the terms and conditions stated herein.  As part of the Bailment Agreement NSWCDD will require manufacturers to conduct a failure diagnosis on any of their units damaged during the test to determine failure points.  Results of that analysis will be provided  to the NSWCDD POC for assessment.  Component failure analysis results could be used by semiconductor manufacturers to design more robust, EMI hardened integrated electronic circuit chips. Depending on the response from manufacturers, a predetermined selection process may be necessary to limit the total number of systems tested due to time and costs.  GPS units that meet IEC 61108-1 Maritime navigation and radio-communication equipment and system second edition 2003-07 or equivalent will be given first priority.  GPS handheld recreational units will not be considered.  Manufacturers who do participate will receive a final report, which will include generic test results, graphs, and test data.  All specific individual manufacturers’ test data will be kept confidential by use of a key code assigned to each unit tested.  This test event is currently planned for December 2004, and manufacturers that wish to participate must execute a Bailment Agreement on or before November 1, 2004.  Upon completion of the Bailment Agreement the manufacturer will be provided with a Key Code and shipping instructions.  Units must be received by NSWCDD on or before  December 1, 2004.  If you are a commercial GPS manufacturer or GPS antenna manufacturer and would like to participate, please contact the NSWCDD POC listed below.

The base has already installed an air monitoring station that includes the capacity to collect information on particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen oxides.  Base personnel are currently handling these tasks.  Additional personnel are required to take over routine operation and maintenance of the station.  The forthcoming RFP document, Reference No: FA5004-04-T-0039, and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation Circular 2001-06.

<DESC>As NASA nears the end of fiscal year 2004, we are well underway with preparations to close our accounting system and issue financial statements.	A crucial component in the closing process is to ensure we have recorded all business activities in the applicable accounting period.  As such, we are sending this notice to our contractors to seek your assistance in this closing effort. First, we want to make you aware that the final payment schedule for FY 2004 will be issued on September 24, 2004.  Our year-end schedule includes a “shutdown” period until October 15th.  All approved payments due and payable through October 15 will be included in the September 24 payment schedule.  We will make every effort to ensure all proper invoices are paid no later than the September 24th cutoff date.  Those invoices not received and approved by September 23, may not be paid until after October 15, 2004.  Your assistance in submitting proper invoices in a timely manner will streamline any necessary approvals and help ensure payment is issued before the shutdown period begins.  Please be advised that after September 24th, we will be unable to process any payments until October 15th.   Secondly, submission of the Contractor Financial Management Report (NASA Form 533M) is also a critical activity in our closing process.  To facilitate the fiscal year-end closing process, we are attempting to assemble our contractor cost data early so we can complete our September month-end cost accruals by Thursday, September 23rd.  You can assist us by submitting your August NF 533 – which includes August actuals and September estimates – no later than Friday, September 17th, if your report is not currently required before that date.  To ensure that your 533 is received timely, you can send it to the following e-mail address:  NF533@LARC.NASA.GOV. We appreciate your assistance in making our year-end closing process as smooth as possible.  We look forward to a successful close to FY 2004 and start of FY 2005.  Should you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact your Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>M -- Performance Decision A 76 Standard Competition of Personal Property Management Branch PSC HHS
<DESC>SUBJECT:  PERFORMANCE DECISION OF A STANDARD COMPETITION STUDY UNDER OMB CIRCULAR A-76, DATED MAY 29, 2003, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER

In accordance with the procedures specified in OMB Circular A-76 (Attachment B, B.1), dated May 29, 2003, public notification was made on October 1, 2003, to announce the standard competition study on the property management specialist commercial functions at the DHHS/PSC/AOS/DPM Personal Property Management Branch (PPMB), located in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The scope of the study included 17 incumbent government FTEs and 18 contract support FTEs.  

In response to the standard competition solicitation of the PPMB, the Agency Tender was the only offer received by the Contracting Officer.  Since no private sector or public reimbursable source offers were received, the Contracting Officer, in accordance with Attachment B, Paragraph D.4.d, of OMB Circular A-76, documented the reasons provided by potential sources for not submitting any responses and recommended in writing to the Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO), that the Agency Tender should be implemented.  Based on the Contracting Officer’s documented recommendation, the CSO proceeded to authorize the implementation of the Agency Tender.

Therefore, under this formal notification, the responsible Contracting Officer announces the performance decision to retain the property management specialist functions in-house and implement the Agency Tender.  

Under a standard competition, only a directly interested party may file a contest under the procedures of FAR Subpart 33.103.  Specific to this standard competition, in that no offers were received from any private sector or public reimbursable source, a directly interested party consists of only the Agency Tender Official and an individual appointed by a majority of directly affected employees as their agent.  Until the resolution of any contest under Attachment B, Paragraph F.1, of OMB Circular A-76, or expiration of the time for filing a contest, only legal agents for directly interested parties shall have access to the certified Standard Competition Form (SCF) and Agency Tender, including the documentation of no satisfactory private sector source.  The agency shall require any legal agent of a directly interested party to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  The agreement shall provide that a signatory may share the information covered by the agreement only with other signatories, and only for purposes of challenging the performance decision.  Upon resolution of a contest challenging a performance decision or expiration of the time for filing such a contest, the certified SCF, Agency Tender and documentation of no satisfactory private sector source shall be available to the public, upon request.  Proprietary information of private sector providers of subcontracts included in the Agency Tender shall not be released.

In accordance with this performance decision the Contracting Officer shall cancel the solicitation under RFP 05X800200 and shall establish an MEO Letter of Obligation with the official responsible for performance of the MEO.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to NimbleGen Systems Inc., 1 Science Court, Madison, WI 53711. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NimbleGen's light-directed, maskless synthesis (MAS) technology of the high-density microarrays is proprietary. This technology allows for rapid re-design of arrays at no additional cost. A major goal of the research is to investigate the extent and significance of alternate intron splicing in fungi. Due to the similarities of the splicing isoforms, only the microarray array technologies employed by NimbleGen that utilize multiple oligonucleotides per gene will provide the required resolution. The microarray will contain up to 240,000 unique 24-mer oligonucleotide probes where each sequence is represented by 12 probes. Data obtained from experiments will be used to design new arrays accordingly. In addition, probes can be clustered to create features of different spot sizes. Instead of physically manufactured masks, a NimbleGen computer file controls the micromirrors that create the array. This will provide us with the required flexibility to fine-tune the array design through iterative processes. This technology will allow us to significantly minimize the upfront costs for custom, high-density array development. Therefore, no other procurement will meet this need. The Mycotoxin Research Unit (MTX), NCAUR, Peoria, IL requires the microarray contain 12 probes per gene. Microarray must be able to include enough features to assess up to 20,000 sequences. Technology must allow multiple array designs. Probe selection must involve proven probe selection strategy. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with NimbleGen without further notice. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
”Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
”Inverted Domestic Corporation”. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-- 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
”Person,” “domestic,” and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

Statement of Work:   The contractor shall obtain a digging permit upon notification of contract award and prior to commencement of work.  Digging permits are available from the Civil Engineer project manager Janie Schultz or Seth Foulkes.  Contractor shall remove concrete slabs, concrete fence post footings and trees north of the base perimeter fence line behind Jasmine Avenue at Altus AFB, Oklahoma.  The fence line work is approximately 2400 linear feet from the North Gate access to the flood canal at Command Circle/Jasmine Avenue. The current fence IDIQ contractor working on the removal and installation of a new perimeter fence is at a work stoppage pending completion of this requirement.  There are approximately 80 trees all varying in height from approximately 4 feet tall to 25 feet tall.  The contractor is required to remove only those trees along the fence line 5 feet south of the perimeter fence to 5 feet north of the perimeter fence line.  The trees to be removed will be identified with a tag by the government and private property owner(s).  Any tree stumps remaining are to be grinded to a below ground depth of 18 to 20 inches.   4-5 concrete slabs measuring approximately 5-6 square feet are to be removed from the flood canal along the perimeter.  The canal width is approximately 5-10 feet in width at the slab location.  The contractor shall replace the broken concrete slabs with rip-rap granite; each piece approximately 10-18 inches in diameter as fill-in for erosion prevention for those slabs removed.   There are approximately 15 concrete fence post footings to be removed.  These footings are not to be confused with the footings in place that have fence posts attached.  The footings to be removed are located near the canal end of the fence line and run west along the perimeter.  These footings will be located between the existing fence posts.  The concrete footings are approximately 8 inches in diameter and about 36 inches deep.  Backfill is not required for the holes left from the removal of the footings.  The contractor shall take precaution not to damage/disrupt the underground utility cables that are in proximity of the work to be conducted.  Any damages to surrounding landscaping, grass, shrubbery, etc. caused by movement of vehicles for the removal of disposal material from the site or similar damage from other types of vehicles and/or equipment shall be repaired and restored back to its original condition before the work on this project will be considered complete.  This includes any damages to the private land owner property along the fence perimeter.  Contractor clean-up shall be continuous on a daily basis.  Contractor shall remove and dispose of the afore mentioned materials to an approved landfill in accordance with environmental, local, federal and state laws and regulations. The period of performance for this project is not to exceed 10 working days from the notice to proceed.  Increment weather is an excuseable delay in order to prevent unnecessary damages to the land owner and government property.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual to determine if work is to be delayed.   Contractor shall submit a signed single line item lump sum proposal for the entire project to the contracting POC identified above.  The site visit is highly encouraged, but not mandatory. The magnitude of this project is estimated to be less than $30K.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the following Questions and Answers we have received regarding this solicitation:  
	 
Question 1.  CLIN #4 can we provide dumpsters at job site or do we need to haul away in our vehicles?
	ANSWER:  The Contractor is required to remove the waste.  If they want to coordinate, on their own, bringing in and placing a dumpster for the particular job, they can do that.  But removal should be included as part of the price of the line item.

Question 2.  CLIN #9 can you please clarify what constitutes normal office furniture.  Will we have to unhook and move computers?  Are there any cubicles that need to be taken apart? 
	ANSWER:  Normal office furniture includes desks, chairs, file cabinets, etc.  The contractor will not be required to move safes, computers, or modular furniture.

Question 3.  CLIN #16 per border installed qty 900 ln ft is this total or is it 900 ln ft of each type of border 12 inch, 9 inch, 6 inch and 4 inch for a total of 3,600 ln ft?
	ANSWER:  The vendor should bid on a total of 900 Lin Ft for CLIN #16.  The unit cost should reflect a price that covers installation of carpet borders of varying sizes (12 inch, 9 inch, 6 inch or 4 inch).

Question 4.  CLIN #23 does MH stand for man hours?
	ANSWER:  Yes, MH stands for manhours.

Question 5.  CLIN #28 can you please clarify that these tiles are non-asbestos.
	ANSWER:  The tiles referred to under CLIN #28 are non-asbestos.

Question 6.  In solicitation it states that you anticipate awarding up to three BPA's with each individual call limit of $25,000 and the master BPA dollar limit is $250,000; Is this for the entire 5 year period?  If I am understanding correctly each BPA's call limit is $25,000 x 3= $75,000 for the 5 year period.  Is this correct?
	ANSWER:  The master BPA dollar limit of $250,000 is for the entire 5 year period on each BPA.  After the BPA's are awarded and the Government has an actual need for these services, a call will be competed between the vendors who have the BPA's.  Each individual call placed aginst the BPA shall not exceed $25,000 unless written authorization is given by the Contracting Officer.
	Vendors are reminded that the estimated quantities in the price list posted on FedBizOpps on 3 Sep 04 are listed for evaluation purposes only and do not reflect any guarantee or actual estimation of the quantities that will be ordered against this BPA.  The Grand Total price of all of the CLINS will be used as the only basis of award of the BPA's.  (The Government anticipates awarding up to three BPA's.)

Question 7.  Send us specifications for carpet and tile (mfg, etc.).  You should tell us what kind of carpet, tile, and etc. should be used.
	ANSWER:  This BPA is for installation services only.  The carpet and tile is provided by the Government.  Per our FedBizOpps posting, all carpet installation shall comply with Section 10 of the Engineering Technical Letter 03-3.

Question 8.  When is site visit/walkthrough?  Mandatory?
	ANSWER:  There will be no walk-through for the Blanket Purchase Agreement solicitation itself.  After award, site visits will probably be held for the individual calls placed on these BPA's.

Vendors are reminded to monitor this website for any updates and/or changes.

<DESC>FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 8 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161 1.  Q.  In SOW Section 2.0 Production Delivery Details, do all these things  need to be provided with the proposal or will this follow after award of  contract?  (For example, the shooting locations, seven suitable actors, three  voice talents). A.  None of the things listed in Section 2.0 of the SOW should be submitted  with the proposal.   2.  Q.  What are the travel possibilities? A.  Travel should be quite limited and may not be necessary at all.   3.  Regarding audio sound bites: Q.  Are they meant to be audio versions of “stock footage,” where contractor  needs to find specific voice actualities from historic speeches?  If so, does  Gov’t have approximate dates when these comments were made?  Were they  recorded, or did they only appear in print?  The following quotes (Page 11 and  14) were not attributed to anyone in the script we reviewed:  “Every American  is an enemy to us” (Osama Bin Laden?); “War with the United States is  inevitable.  We cannot avoid it.”  Is that said by a foreign leader?  If so,  who, and as with the other quotes, do we need to find a voice actuality of it?   If not, are these clips to be read by a narrator, or perhaps by an actor or  narrator with a foreign accent (or several different actors)? A.  The last option is probably the best.  Finding actual sound bites might be  very tough and is not required by the Statement of Work.  However, the Gov’t  does not want to dictate how the contractor to handle this issue.     4.  Q.  Willl the source of these quotations be identified in some way, such as  text on the screen? A.  They could be added in text but this isn’t required by the Statement of  Work.  This is up to the contractor.   5.  Q.  One sound bite appears to be an oath of office by a president.  Do you  want an actual news sound bite?  If so, which president? A.  This sound bite is the same as anyone who gives the oath to protect the  country, i.e., military oath. 6.  Q.  What is the anticipated shelf life of this project? A.  Approximately 2 to 3 years max. 7.  Q.  What is the intended distribution or audience for this project?  Who is  the intended audience? A.  18 to 24 year olds and slightly above…students, recent grads, ROTC, USAF  Academy Cadets, general public 8.  Q.  Can we use appropriate mixes of production library music, or do we need  to commission an original music score? A.  Production music is fine; however, the Gov’t does not want to dictate how  the contractor handles this issue. 9.  Q.  How long are the “Special Features” segments for which the contractor  is responsible?  (A.  Interviews/commentaries by actors, and B.  Behind-the- scenes location shoot and editing) A.  The contractor would shoot the actors while on the set.  NASIC will edit  the videos here and provide several pieces for inclusion on the DVD.   10.  Q.  For behind the scenes shots of the production portions, can we use a  handheld mini-DV camera?  Should we use Digital Betacam for the more formal  interviews, or do you prefer the more informal, behind-the scenes approach that  the mini DV brings? A.  DV would be fine; however, that is up to the contractor to decide. 11.  Q.  The jet pilot attack scene (pages 22-24) is to be a stock shot of a  fighter jet cockpit, with actors voicing the dialogue between the pilot and the  ACC.  In other words, no effort will be made to shoot a specific video scene  for this? A.  Correct, stock footage will be used.   12.  Q.  The NASIC-in-action shots on page 18 are to be stock footage.  Does  the military have relevant footage for this type on file that the contractor  could access? A.  NASIC will provide the in-house footage for page 18. 13.  Q.  What is the specific purpose of this production? A.  To show college students, cadets and the general public the nature of  threats to our country and the critical role that NASIC plays in identifying,  understanding and deterring those threats. *************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE,  2 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161.   1.

A  SECRET clearance is not required to submit a quote or to be awarded a contract  for this project.  Paragraph 5.3 of the SOW will be revised to reflect this  change and a revision will be posted to this web site.   3.  Q.  Is all taping to take place at Wright-Patterson AFB? A.  Not necessarily.  Per SOW paragraph 2.1, the contractor is to recommend at  least three locations. 4.  Q.  How should price quotation be broken down – itemized or a lump sum? A.

Para 2.8 of the SOW concerning animation, are NASIC shield and USAF  logo to be animated in 2D or 3D? A.  Animation should be 3D. 7.  Q.  Para 2.10 of the SOW, the requirement for an active web link requires a  DVD-ROM master which limits your playback universe.  Does NASIC want a DVD or  DVD-ROM? A.  NASIC wants a DVD.  8.  Q.  Para 2.11, Replication and Packaging:  What are the packaging  requirements? A.  Packaging should be mailable by the USPS, but attractive and easy to take  hundreds to various locations (schools, trade shows, etc.).  Also, in para 3.0  of the SOW, it states that DVD replication disks should be in 4 color packaging. 9.  Q.  With the delivery date 12 weeks after the award of the contract, do you  have a projection as to when you will be awarding the contract? A.  It is our intent to award a contract mid-late Sep 04.   10.  Q.  Para 1.1.6 of the SOW, meetings are to be held between NASIC rep and  the PM.

<DESC>FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 9 SEP 04 DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF QUOTATION PACKAGES IS HEREBY CHANGED TO TUESDAY, 14  SEP 04, 4:00 PM EST. THE FOLLOWING ARE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS PERTAINING TO FA8601-04-T-0161: 1.  Q.  Does 4-color packaging refer to the printing on the DVD itself or to a  4-color insert to go inside the DVD case?   If it refers to the insert, is the  contractor responsible for writing and designing the 4-color insert? A.  If the insert means a booklet inside the DVD package, the contractor does  not need to develop.   If the insert means the cardboard label inside the clear plastic cover on the  DVD package exterior, then yes, the contractor will need to develop.  NASIC has  artwork for the package exterior, however contractor will need to modify,  include text and reproduce.   2.  Q.  Do you have an idea of the length you+re expecting for the DVD review  disk? A.  Video is expected to be 10 minutes, reviews will probably be up to the  same.    3.  Q.  Some of the historic scenes may be more available as stills.  Would you  object to a mixture of stills and live action video to cover the historic  material? A.  No, historic scenes should be moving/live video.  4. Q. Is the writer familiar with the location of the stock footage written  into the script? A.  There are dozens of stock footage houses and NASIC will not dictate where  the contractor should access/pull stock footage.  However, it would be helpful  for NASIC to review the research footage contractor receives from stock house (s) prior to purchasing to ensure adequate/suitable footage.   5.  Q.  The reference to the music on storyboard frame 3 is unclear because any  form of a pop song will not be license free--"Does Anybody Really Know What  Time It Is?" - Chicago.  Time seems to be the story theme of the video and the  phrase "Do you know what time it is?...Do you care?" is used with the 9-11  shots.  So I guess the question here is, do you want contractor to find license- free music or do you want them to use pop music that people would be familiar  with and pay for it? A.  The reference to Chicago is not set in stone.  We+d prefer to use license- free music, so contractor may adjust music selection accordingly.   6.  Q.  Pages 22, 23 + 24 of the “7 Seconds” storyboard refer to “stock  footage” inside a jet cockpit, including a warning light going off and the  pilot taking counter measures. Again, something so specific may not be  available as stock footage. Does this mean that:  this footage can be “generic” and enhanced with computer graphics and sound  effects to achieve the desired effect this footage exists somewhere else other  than a stock footage house and we can have access to it or that it is  potentially new footage that needs to be shot in a jet simulator cockpit? A.  NASIC has existing "generic" footage for this portion of the storyboard,  however will require customization/manipulation to simulate alarms and voice  communications to/from control tower.    7. Q. In 3.0 Deliverables you request B-roll footage on DigiBeta and Dvcam and  stock footage and production elements on Dvcam. Since all footage in this  project is either stock footage, footage provided by NASIC, or footage we shoot  of the students, what is being referred to in the deliverable as “B-roll  footage”? A.  B-roll footage includes un-used full or partial sections of stock footage  and student section not in the final product.    8.  Q.  Are “extras” required for the classroom scene behind the primary actors? A.  Extras not required, but would be up to the contractor. 9. Q.  In the Q+A it states that “NASIC will produce and edit the  interview/commentaries of the script writers, committee members, and NASIC  employees and provide this to the contractor for inclusion in the DVD.” Please  clarify if the contractor is responsible in any way for either shooting or  editing the interview/commentaries or the behind the scenes sequence for the  DVD. If we are responsible for any of this content, is there a desired length  of the final pieces? A.  Contractor is responsible for shooting and editing the  interviews/commentaries with actors in the student portion of the video.   Desired length is approximately 2-3 minutes per actor for  interviews/commentaries.  NASIC will produce and edit the  interviews/commentaries with script writers, committee members, and NASIC  employees.    *************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 8 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161 1.  Q.  In SOW Section 2.0 Production Delivery Details, do all these things  need to be provided with the proposal or will this follow after award of  contract?

What are the travel possibilities? A.  Travel should be quite limited and may not be necessary at all.   3.  Regarding audio sound bites: Q.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to add the following statement:

Pricing shall be given on a per call basis and include pricing for each option year.


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number is FSIS-17-B-04 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This is intended to be awarded as a Single Award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-20.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) Code is 561421 and the size standard of $6,000,000.00 applies to this procurement.  This requirement is being conducted as a Commercial Item and is set aside 100% Total Small Business. The requirement is for services to provide 24-Hour Answering Service on an “As Needed Basis” for USDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) Meat and Poultry Hotline in accordance with attached Statement of Work.  The period of performance includes one base year and four (4) option years.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) clauses and/or provisions apply to this solicitation as follows: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items; 52-212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items.(a)The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: (i) technical capability to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; and (iii) price.  Technical and past performances, when combined are significantly more important than price. 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options also applies to this requirement. The Government intends to award without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with prospective contractors if it is in the best interest of the Government. The additional FAR clauses/provisions apply:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

Wage Determination will be incorporated upon award.  The offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 with its offer.

Responses shall provide literature, brochures and other such information in order to determine the ability to meet the abovall basis and include pricing for each option year.
 
13. Since pricing is to be based per call...what is the average length of the current call?  This would help us determine cost effective pricing since our actual cost is based on the time the operator is on the line with the caller.  A one minute call would obviously cost less than a five minute call, for example.
 
It varies depending on questions and issues involved. A call could last 3 or 4 minutes up to 15 or 20. some people have more than one question and sometimes one question leads to another. 
 
14. Is there a current contract in place?  No 

15. Will training be provided to the call center employees? 

This will operate in the same manner as the other times large recalls required we use an outsourcing call center company. The contractor had FSIS approved materials---press releases, Q&A’s, etc that the telephone agents used. They also had an approved recorded message on their system that consumers could listen to while they waited, if they chose, to listen to a live operator.  
These situations arise suddenly and there is no time to for USDA to “train” agents before they answer calls. The contractor can choose to do whatever they want with their existing staff as far as “training” goes. Call center telephone agents should have the basic telephone people skills necessary to deal with the public. I would assume since a contractor is bidding on this SOW, that they are already in the call center business and have permanent, full-time, qualified telephone agents.
 
16. Other than amendments, is there other documentation expected to be released?  No 

17. Is there a submittal package (SF1449, section "k", etc..) to return?  No, this is going to be a Blanket Purchase Agreement not a contract. 

18. Do we simply submit our pricing?  See Amendment 01 posted on Fedbizopps.  Pricing shall be given on a per call basis and include pricing for each option year. 

19. I have looked over the documents for the above Solicitation, and I would like to know why it is going to be issued on an as needed basis?  Will government workers be doing the work at all other times, or will Contractors only be needed when a government employee won't be available for that particular day? Can you explain why the winner of the procurement will not have someone working at all times?

We have Government Workers that handle the calls for our Hotline.  This BPA is being issued to cover us when we have a large emergency recall and we need help to handle the overflow of calls during that time.

20. Do you have any statistics on length of calls?

We estimate 200 to 500 calls per day and could be more.  Contractor shall have capability of handling up to 2000 calls per day.  Calls average about 3 to 4 minutes.
 
21.  The RFQ states that live operators and recorded messages must answer calls 24-hours/day, 7 days/week.  Does this requirement mean that both live operators and recorded messages must be available at all times?  The information on USDA's website about the hotline indicates that live operators are available from 10 am - 4 pm Eastern time on weekdays and from 8 am - 2 pm on Thanksgiving.  Automated messages provide information at all other times.

Yes, it requires that the contractor have live operators available 24 hours a day for 7 days a week along with a recorded message available when all lines busy.  Understand that this service is for emergencies only.

22.  Are there particular educational/experience requirements for hotline operators for this procurement?

No

23.  How often does the government anticipate issuing a BPA Call?  For example, do call patterns at the hotline lead the government to anticipate using this contract to handle overflows on a daily, weekly, monthly, etc. basis, and how long might a Call extend?  For example, we understand that call surges would come with the winter holidays; would a BPA Call during that time be made several times throughout that period, or would a Call be issued for November and December?  Another source of call surges requiring use of the contract would be for product recalls.  How does the government anticipate using the contract to handle such a surge - would the government expect to issue a Call every day as needed, or, upon hearing of a recall, anticipate a high-volume period of a week, two weeks, month, etc. and issue a Call for that period, ending or extending it as needed?

There is no way to determine frequency of services. The only time of the year there is a predictable increase of calls is Thanksgiving week.  USDA may or may not require overflow services at that time.  Requirement for service is on case-by-case basis.  There is rarely any advance notice of a large volume product recall and the duration of the service could be days or weeks and cannot be determined in advance.


24.  The RFQ indicates that during a BPA Call approximately 200-500 calls per day might be handled.  Does this include both calls requiring live operators as well as calls handled through automated messages?  If so, what is the anticipated breakdown of calls between live operators and automated messages?

Yes. This includes all calls.  There is no breakdown of calls between live operators and automated messages. That is random and determined by various factors including number of agents taking calls, number of telephone lines, duration of calls, length of message, time of day, day of week, scope of recall, etc.


25.  The RFQ indicates that during a BPA Call, the contract must have the capacity to handle up to 2,000 calls per day.  Again, does this include both calls requiring live operators as well as calls handled through automated messages?  If so, what is the anticipated breakdown of calls between live operators and automated messages?  How often would the government anticipate that the contractor might have to handle more than the average 200-500 calls per day (e.g., only around Thanksgiving; every time there is a recall, which occurs every one to two months; etc.)

See Answers above.

26.  How many minutes, on average, is a call that involves a live operator?

Consumer calls about general food safety questions may last 3 to 4 minutes on average. The length of call depends on the topic.  Some calls may last longer. It is important to note that the contractor will only be addressing food safety questions using only USDA approved materials (press release, Q&A's, fact sheets) as pertain to the reason for the outsourcing requirement such as a product recall.  The contractor will not be addressing general food safety questions but will refer those callers to the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline.

27.  What commercial items are we providing pricing for?  Each year as a lump sum?  Incremental increments of support time(i.e., hour, day, week, month), labor hours by category?

Per call basis and provide pricing for each option year.

28.  Would a BPA call ever occur outside of normal business hours?

Yes, it is possible.  This entire service is for use in emergency situations only.

29.  Where can we obtain the applicable wage determination?

You can access the Wage Determinations at website: www.wdol.gov/sca.aspx.  Click on Selecting SCA WDS.

30. Is the requirement for Spanish only applicable to the recorded messages, or does it apply as well to the live operators?

Yes, both  

31. Ms.Robertson, item (b) under the Statement of Work would 
suggest that the task is on a "will call" basis. The 
capacity is well defined. Should I assume the contractor 
must be in full swing within the (4) four hour call?

Yes. When the BPA Call issued you need to be ready to accept calls within 4 hours.

 
32. Is there any historical data available that would include busy hour reporting?  If so, may we receive a copy of it?
No
33. What is the average length of call?
3 to 4 minutes, but could be longer.
 
34.  Can the development costs be charged separately or are they to be included in the cost per call?
You can include in your proposal development costs as a separate cost and include if that cost is a one time cost or the cost would be a charge everytime we issue a call.  This will be considered during the evaluation process. 
 
35.  Regarding the four (4) hour response to the BPA Call, is it safe to assume the contractor will have four (4) hours to staff to handle 2,000 calls each day the BPA  Call is issued?
 
Yes
36.  Are the 200-500 calls per day subject to the four (4) hour BPA?
 
You will only receive calls after the BPA Call is issued.

37.  Are the 200-500 calls per day to be received seven (7) days a week?
Yes
 
38.  Is the BPA Call only for calls over the estimated 200-500 calls per day? 
The BPA Call will be issued when we need additional help to handle additional calls that we will probably receive after an emergency or large meat/poultry recall happens.  The contractor shall expect to receive 200 to 500 calls per day, possibly more.  We estimate up to 2,000 calls per day.

39. Are the 200-500 calls to be taken after the regular office hours of 8-4? 
The calls are to be taken during regular and after office hours.

40. Is there an incumbent vendor?  If so, who is it?  No

<DESC>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS
SOLICITATION FSIS-17-B-04

1. How do you want this bid, time, per call, per month? Do you have any traffic statistics?

Please price per call and include pricing for each option year.  I have issued a amendment to the solicitation that will be posted by tomorrow to include this.

2. In the Combined Solicitation, it indicates that that contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, management, supplies to perform this service and that this is on an as needed basis. The solicitation further states that the contractor will respond within 4 hours of the BPA Call being made.  My questions are:
•	Will the contractor be required to integrate their equipment into the FSIS current system or will the contractor be required to have a separate number prepared for this? 
Must have a separate number.  No integration into FSIS system.
•	Will the contractors personnel be required on site at FSIS within 4 hours or does the contractor have to be ready to receive the calls within 4 hours?   Contractor will not be onsite.  Must receive calls at their own facility within 4 hours.

3. Would the Geographic location of the WA place our location outside of USDA geographical requirements?
 Is there any way for my county seat to pursue?  (I may have other options for this, but it never hurts to ask)?  Place of Performance for this requirement is at the contractor's facility.  Contractor does not have to be located in any particular location.
 
4. Sol# FSIS-17-B-04 indicates the size standard of $6,000,000.00 
applies to this procurement.

Is the $6,000,000.00 for the total blanket purchase award to 
cover ONLY 1 year at the above amount. Or to cover the 1 year and 
4 year option, if extended.

The size standard is the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates)may be to remain a small business for SBA's programs and for the Federal contracting programs.

This size standard would cover the entire period of the BPA (5 Years).


5.    Is the program outsourced today?  If so, are you at liberty to disclose who the provider is?  No 


6.      Are the numbers to be answered toll free (800) numbers?  If so, are they owned by the USDA?   No 


7.    Should we assume for quoting purposes that the USDA will maintain the cost of the 
800/longdistance service?  No 


8.  The answering service seems driven by information that might be released (either by the
government or by the media) that relates to a meat/poultry issue.  Based on the solicitation, it appears 
we’d need to have a general contact management system that records customer inquiries and 
provides appropriate responses based on the customer issue.  Is this correct?  USDA provides 
all information. Any and all information presented to consumers must be FSIS approved. 

9.  I know the call volume will vary, but do you have any historical reporting we could review to 
understand the spikes in volume?  We are estimating 200 to 500 calls per day 
maybe more. Contractor shall capacity to handle up to 2000 calls per day. 

10. What traditionally is the training timeframe for a representative? There is no established 
timeframe. 

11. Do you have an idea of how your decision will be made (i.e. how performance, approach and price would be weighted)?  We want to be sure to build our response to you appropriately.
 
As mentioned in the Solicitation, There are three evaluation factors:  1) technical capability to meet the Government; 2) past performance; 3) price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined are significantly more important than price.  

12. One more question that I thought of last night…………..is there any specific pricing format you are looking for? (i.e. pay by hour, pay by minute, pay by call?).  Just wanted to be sure we provide you back information in the proper format.

Yes - I just issued a amendment to the solicitation to add the following statement:
 
Pricing shall be given on a per ce stated capabilities.  Offerors shall submit References to include such information for the most relevant contracts (completed and/or ongoing) which your company has had within the last three years. Please include Customers, name, address, and telephone number; contract number, type, and total original and present or final contract value; date of contract, place of performance, and delivery dates or period of performance; brief description of work comparable to the proposed effort. To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this solicitation, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  To register, you may apply through the Internet at www.ccr.gov. Written quotations shall be submitted no later than April 9, 2004 by 2:00pm.Quotes may be sent to Deborah Robertson by facsimile to 301/504-4276, mail, or email to deborah.robertson@fsis.usda.gov. POC for this requirement is Deborah Robertson, Contracting Officer, 301/504-4237.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to the following questions regarding Solicitation NNJ0479096Q.   (1)  How much storage space do you desire?	 At least 400 GB in storage (2)  What is the length recording time you require? At least 8 hours for the 16 channels at 200 kHz, 24 bits and at least 2 hours for 8 channels at 10 MS/s, 12 bits. (3)  The system is required to have 16 differential input channels with 200 kHz sample rate per channel at 24 bits resolution; are these 16 Analog inputs? Yes, they are analog inputs, which get digitized by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at 24-bit resolution.   (4)  The term "24 bit resolution" can assume 2 explanations:   (a)  One is associated with digital data only in which one assumes that input is simply 24 bits wide   (b)  The other one is associated with a number of A/Ds (Analog to Digital Converters) used:      1. If 1 A/D is used then it really means 24 bit digitization from an analog signal      2. If 2 A/Ds are used it would mean 2 x digitization of 12 bits (each A/D would digitize to 12 bits)      3. If 3 A/Ds are used it would mean 3 x digitization of 8 bits (each A/D digitizes to 8 bits) Which one of these cases above is the applicable to your synopsis? Explanation (b)1 is applicable to the synopsis NNJ0479096Q.  24 bit resolution in this case is associated with the number of A/Ds to be used.	One A/D is to be used, translating into 24 bit digitization from an analog signal. (5)  Is the data acquisition system intended to be rack mounted? This equipment is not required to be rack mounted. (6)  Do you know if we are supposed to attach a formal proposal with details on the proposed system?   You should include product specifications with your quote.  However, a formal proposal is not required.   (7)  Are there any requirements on providing information on previous contracts? No.  Past Performance on previous contracts is not being used as a selection criterion in this procurement. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on August 31, 2004.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
