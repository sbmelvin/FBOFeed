<DESC>The Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) will issue a solicitation Request of Proposal (RFP) FA4452-12-R-0016 on or about 17 May 2012 for Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) services utilizing the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. This requirement will provide PMEL services at the following seven CONUS AMC bases: Joint Base Andrews MD, Dover AFB DE, Scott AFB IL, Fairchild AFB WA, Grand Forks AFB ND, MacDill AFB FL, and McConnell AFB KS. The PMEL services requirement consists of the following areas: advanced electrical, electronics, electromechanical, mechanical, physics, optics, and thermal principles; mathematics and number systems; operating principles of complex and intricate Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) and laboratory standards; interpreting block, schematic, wiring and logic diagrams and technical data; troubleshooting techniques; calibration traceability, metrology techniques, laboratory practices, and planning; microprocessors; computer operational principles, language, and software; and use, care for, and repair of complex and intricate TMDE, laboratory standards, hand tools, and special tools.
<p>This is a competitive best value source selection using tradeoff process IAW FAR 15.101-1 and DFARS 215.3. The government will utilize performance/price tradeoff technique IAW AFFARS 5315.3 documented at MP 5315 AFFARS Library/Section M Templates/Approach #3 - Evaluate Technical, Rank by Price, Assess Performance until Proposal rated Substantial Confidence or all offers are evaluated. This technique is a simplified method that permits a tradeoff between price and performance in reaching the contract award decision. The government will award a contract resulting from this RFP to the contractor whose offer conforms to the RFP requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and provides the best value to the government. If the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price does not receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment rating, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated for a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment. The evaluation process will continue until an offer that is technically acceptable receives a performance confidence assessment rating of "Substantial Confidence" or all offers are evaluated. At this point, the evaluation is complete and the SSA proceeds to the integrated best value assessment of the evaluated offerors.<br /><br />This requirement will be a competitive set aside for 8(a) small businesses utilizing NAICS Code 811219 as it is anticipated that offers will be received from two or more 8(a) small businesses.<br />The anticipated period of performance is as follows:</p>
<p>Transition/Phase-In Period 1 Jan 13 - 31 Jan 13<br />Base Period 1 Feb 13 - 30 Sep 13<br />Option Period 1 1 Oct 13 - 30 Sep 14<br />Option Period 2 1 Oct 14 - 30 Sep 15<br />Option Period 3 1 Oct 15 - 30 Sep 16<br />Option Period 4 1 Oct 16 - 30 Sep 17</p>
<p>Total anticipated performance is 57 months.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date is 20 December 2012.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Gerstel, Inc., 701 Digital Drive, Suite J, Linthicum, Maryland, for purchase of (4) XYZ Robot-based Multipurpose Autosampler Systems (MPS2) with the 2 position peltier single drawer coolstack. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instument Manufacturing.
<p><br />The XYZ Robot-based Multipurpose Autosampler Systems (MPS2) will be used to provide automated liquid inlet injections of samples for the measurement of trans fatty acids in human plasma and serum. The MPS2 systems allow more samples to be analyzed in a single experiment and are projected to increase lab throughput by more than 100% for following trans fatty acids. This allows the NCEH to meet its research time-requirements. <br /><br />Gerstel, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the patented MPS2 equipment. Therefore, Gerstel, Inc. is the only source for this requirement.NCEH currently has (11) MPS2 systems configured for use with our existing chromatography and analytical technology and the use of MPS2 systems minimizes the amount of time required to modify a method on a comparable instrument. Using another Autosampler system would require additonal time and resources due to additional equipment training. In addition, use of another type of Autosampler would increase the time and resources required for method development, since NCEH would need to spend 1-4 months revalidating methods, reprogramming software, and checking instrument sensitivity. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Gerstel, Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd<strong> VIA EMAIL ONLY</strong> at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-14452 referenced in the subject line <strong>NO LATER THAN</strong> April 6, 2012. <strong>The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal requests.</strong> All requests must be in writing. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

The information provided by the purchase of this data will be merged with information from other nutrient database sources for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive packaged food nutrient database, which previously did not exist. The manner in which the data are collected, maintained, and provided is proprietary in nature and it is this proprietary process that makes this particular dataset unique to the fulfillment of the needs of this project. <br />This comprehensive nutrient database will continue to be used to track key foods that are major contributors to sodium intake in the U.S. The results of this investigation are crucial to the tracking of the sodium content of foods sold in the U.S., which is an important step in reducing cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />CDC is not requesting competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to puchase Archivers, that will provide networkstorageto archive housekeeping, non housekeeping, and science instrument team data. TheMCCS Archiver is designed such that it is composed into two hardware units, a Directattached Storage (DAS) disk array which provides storage over fiber Channel, and a serverwhich mounts the DAS and Servers NFS and SNMP over multiple networks. The specificationsare attached titled: Technical Requirements January 31, 2012. Note: See attached QualityAssurance Document 1. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from One Stop Systems because much developmenthas already deeply involved both the server and disk array selected. Choosing hardwareprovided from a new vendor would cause undue burden both in respect to time of workneeded in integrate a different system, undergo testing and in terms of money.Additionaly, the segmentation of different brands of hardware will cause undue hardshipsin maintaining different builds of system software for even slightly different hardwaresystems. No equivalent computer can be obtained from any other source which meets thespecific combination of requirements. Any other contractor selected would need toimplement a design that is compatible with current One Stop Systems disk arrays. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to Jenny Staggs at jenny.y.staggs@nasa.gov not later than 4:00 p.m. PDTon Friday, April 6, 2012.

The performance work statement is attached titled: PerformanceWork Statement for 747 Flight Simulator Visual System Upgrade Installation 21 March 2012. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the services from United Airlines (UAL), the flighttraining simulator is currently located at UAL's training facility in Denver, Colorado.Operations and maintenance (O&M) for the flight simulator is being provided by UAL undera separate NASA facility lease and maintenance contract NND11AQ62P. UAL's technical andmaintenance staff are all trained and certified to service simulator. UAL is uniquely andintimately familiar with the proposed IOS upgrade. Purchase of any other vendor servicesacquired in a competitive procurement would require additional non-recurring engineering(NRE), integration, and test support services, in order to make the upgrade.Additionally, using another vendor would require negotiating access to the facility whichis proprietorial. Also, using other than UAL services would lead to scheduling conflictsand delay in conducting required flight crew training.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for 19, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 to controlmosquitoes in outlying areas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary toapply chemicals to areas impossible to spray without an aircraft.  Dibrom 14 is suppliedannually by KSC to the Brevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordancewith the Mosquito Control Agreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fishand Wildlife Service(USFWS), and Brevard County.  AMVAC Chemical Corporation, themanufacturer of Dibrom 14,has verified that ADAPCO, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida isthe sole distributor of this product for the state of Florida.	Other authorizeddistributors are prohibited from distributing the product beyond their state or assignedterritory.  KSC intends to purchase the 19, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 from ADAPCO,Incorporated of Sanford, Florida.  Dibrom 14 is an adulticide used to control mosquitoes. There are several areas at the Launch Pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicalsused at KSC cannot be sprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, these areas are also very large and impossible to spray without an aircraft,which KSC does not possess.  The Mosquito Control Agreement provides the equipment(aircraft) to spray large areas of water in the KSC area to control mosquitoes withouthaving to spray directly around the launch pads.  KSC procures and supplies the Dibrom 14to BCMCD for spraying.	Dibrom 14 is the only chemical that can be used, because it isthe only chemical BCMCD is licensed to spray in the KSC and impound areas.

<CONTACT>Victoria Anne Cunningham, Contract Specialist, Phone 919-541-4027, Email victoria.cunningham@nih.gov
<DESC>This is not an RFP. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purpose of providing a hosted data management system in support of the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The objective of this acquisition is to obtain a hosted data management system to collect data from multiple laboratories and host the data in a secure central database which the NTP scientists can access in order to review and analyze the data. The system shall use the internet to transmit the collected data securely back to the hosted database.
<p>Every year the NTP directs numerous studies of the toxicological effects of various test articles. The data from these studies of reproductive and developmental toxicological effects are not housed by the NTP in an electronic database and thus the data are difficult to access, analyze and archive. The NTP needs to ensure access to the data, plus the ability to analyze and archive the results. This acquisition provides a solution to this need.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain a system that allows:</p>
<p>1. Access to a hosted commercial in-life data collection and management system for use by personnel of the NTP and contract laboratories carrying out NTP-directed research for one base year and nine option years. <br />2. User access across multiple locations.<br />3. Performance of statistical tests, upload capability, and ability to meet usability requirements.<br />4. Housing of multiple NTP study types.</p>
<p><br />This requirement will be 100% set-aside for small businesses. The NAICS code is 518210, size standard is $25.0 million.</p>
<p>The release date of the RFP is anticipated to be on or around April 30, 2012 with proposals due within thirty (30) days of the aforementioned expected release date. The anticipated effective date for the award is July 1, 2012. These dates are not firm and subject to change.</p>
<p>One (1) contract award will be made and the contract will have a period of performance of one (1) year with nine (9) option years. The contract will be a firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p>All questions must be in writing and may be e-mailed to victoria.cunningham@nih.gov. Contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.<br />Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site for all procurement related information and must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. The forthcoming RFP will contain all requirements and instructions for proposal submission.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Leica Microsystems, located at 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089, for the acquisition of: Head Mounted Microscope, Fluorescent Microscope, HD Microscope Camera, and Computer Guided Stereotaxic.</p>
<p>The NINDS has a requirement for obtaining a moveable objective microscope, to couple with an existing femtosecond pulsed infrared laser to be used as a two photon laser scanning microscope, and a micropipette puller and multi-manipulator system, which will be used for electrophysiological recordings from neurons during imaging procedures with the laser scanning microscope. The microscope will be used to record the position and changes in fluorescence from fluorophores in living and fixed brain tissue from animal research samples. The project will help explain the functional and structural wiring diagrams of neural circuits related to visual information processing in visual systems. Items being procured are necessary to label neurons with fluorescent molecules, visualize the injection sites, and monitor placement and activity of neuronal labels. Following, tissues must be dissected under high magnification, be performed under computer precision to minimize errors, and implemented under constant pressure to obtain reproducible results.</p>
<p>Leica Microsystems is the only known source that can satisfy agency requirements. Leica Microsystems owns a patented Triple Beam design of their fluorescent microscope, which when used in combination with the unique features of its other products, fulfills the experimental requirements of NINDS.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the acquisition of commercial items prescribed in FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 
The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Cost type, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Rockwell Collins, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The contract will have a one-year ordering period with a six month option period.
  Orders will be placed against the contract on a sole-source basis with Rockwell Collins in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary software/information and expertise of Rockwell Collins, duplicative cost to the Government that it would not expect to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement through any other source.  The effort is a continuation of phased developmental activities in the development of the United States Air Force (USAF) Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) Close Air Support System (CASS) software.
  Tasks include development, prototype, test, deployment and support of software releases that enhance the ability of TACPs to interface both with the ground forces they support and the aircraft conducting air operations, as well as with airspace Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) organizations.  

No formal solicitation will be issued.  All responsible sources may inquire into the specific terms and conditions; such inquiries will be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Questions concerning this action may be directed to Ms. Lisa Sandy at telephone (812) 854-8792 or email lisa.a.sandy@navy.mil.  

Please reference solicitation number N00164-12-R-JS12 when responding to this notice.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Jacksonville (FLCJAX) is seeking information to define its acquisition strategy regard to the available socio-economic programs for the solicitation and award of refurbishing support for the 1st Stage Turbine Blades   This advertisement serves to aid in determining market interest and capabilities for this prospective contract, of the available strategies, FISCJAX is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) Small Business set-aside and/or 8 (a) suitability. The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB or Small Business entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.
 

From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy. Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your company's business interests. If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis.

Interested contractors that are not currently an approved source shall submit a Source Approval Request (SAR) package.

<a href="mailto:Jones.Sammie@epa.gov">jones.sammie@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with North Carolina State University, Nuclear Energy Services, Department of Nuclear Engineering, Raleigh, NC to provide non-destructive elemental analyses by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) Gamma Spectrometry of up to 1293 environmental and biological samples that are needed as part of an ongoing study of the bioavailability of metalloids (e.g., arsenic) and metals (e.g., cadmium) in soil samples.  NC State, Department of Nuclear Engineering has previously provided elemental analysis of environmental and biological samples collected in this research which provides a benchmark for analyses performed under this study.  Samples have a finite shelf life and need to be processed in the same manner, by the same vendor to ensure quality of data and continuity of service.  Having these samples processed by a different vendor would affect the scientific quality of the data and render the results of analysis useless. Therefore, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for these particular samples.  The circumstance permitting ?other than full and open competition? at this time is FAR 13.501(a), "sole source".  The anticipated period of performance is a 12 month base period with one (1) additional 12 month option periods.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will  be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Sammie Jones (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

Without the lures, defining the area of an infestation might not be possible and the ultimate cost to the USDA and cooperators of an eradication program would increase substantially as the pest number grow and spread undetected. The period of performance would be from the date of award and not to exceed five years from that date.</p>
<p><br />Tuta absoluta lure - with the following requirements:<br />a. (E,Z,Z)-3,8,11-Tetradecatrienyl acetate - 95%<br />b. (E,Z)-3,8-Tetradecadienyl acetate - 5%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuta Absoluta lure, bulk packaged ( Estimated quantity 15-20,000 yearly)</p>
<p>Tuta Absoluta lure, individually packaged ( Estimated Quantity 3 to 5,000 yearly)</p>
<p>The load rate should allow for field usage of up to 28 days.</p>
<p>Semiochemical lures when combined with a variety of traps have been shown to be an effective monitoring tool for T. absoluta. The various trap and lure combinations have enabled the USDA to better contain and monitor potential infestations of these insects. T. absoluta is one of the most serious exotic plant pests threatening tomato and pepper producers and environmental resources. The USDA APHIS PPQ has been tasked by congress with detecting, monitoring and managing these insects. These insects, should they become established, would have irreversible impacts on natural resources, hinder trade and increase costs of productions. Ultimately, an eradication and/or control program could cost millions of dollars if these insects were to go undetected in our environment.</p>

The USDA will be shipping from Edinburg, TX to various locations throughout the US, with a maximum shipping time of 6 days with various temperature exposures during this transit time. It shall be understood that storage condition requirements (i.e., refrigeration) will not be met during this time and the shelf life of the lures must not be adversely impacted because of this shipping time.</p>
<p>Specifications</p>
<p>Lures:</p>
<p>APHIS, through peer reviewed literature, understands that the listed blending of semiochemicals below to be an attractant for Tuta absoluta.</p>
<p>a. (E,Z,Z)-3,8,11-Tetradecatrienyl acetate - 95%<br />b. (E,Z)-3,8-Tetradecadienyl acetate - 5%</p>
<p><br />APHIS is seeking the above described semiochemical blend which is consistent with peer reviewed information. Traditionally, a solution of attractant has been dispensed on to a sleeve stopper (a.k.a. rubber septum) of polyisobutyl-based elastomeric polymer, 19-20 mm in length; the wider end of the stopper shall be 9-10 mm in diameter with a 6-mm diameter by 6-7 mm deep recess or "cup" (West Pharmaceutical 1-F SS 1888 GRY, or substitute of comparable size that delivers comparable stability and release rates of attractant).</p>
<p>Absorption of attractant into stoppers entails dilution of the attractant in an organic solvent (hexane or methylene chloride; min. 100 &micro;l per septum); the solution is applied to the septum, allowed to soak in, and the solvent is allowed to evaporate before the septum is packaged.</p>
<p>The final product must have a minimum of 100 &micro;g of compound a. ((E,Z,Z)-3,8,11-Tetradecatrienyl acetate) and a correlating concentration of compound b. (E,Z)-3,8-Tetradecadienyl acetate so that the required ratios are obtained.</p>
<p>APHIS is willing to consider other methods of semiochemical presentation. However, if they are proposed APHIS reserves the right to exclude these products from the current bidding process until a complete understanding of the effectiveness of the alternate presentation is understood. APHIS may perform this testing or ask the submitter to provide testing results or additional information for review.</p>
<p>Contract End Items</p>
<p>APHIS will receive a functional Tuta absoluta pheromone lure that is capable of lasting 4 weeks in all field environments.</p>
<p>Sampling Testing of Dispensers<br />Effectiveness <br />It is important that USDA APHIS maintain a quality assurance (QA) program. To that end, USDA APHIS reserves the right to conduct QA testing. The USDA APHIS may perform QA testing addressing the following areas:</p>
<p>The dispenser shall be resistant to damage and moisture when handled during normal field trapping operations. <br />The dispenser contains an amount at least equal to requirements established in the specifications.<br />This may be done using a necessary battery of laboratory testing, yet to be established. <br />The installation method will not be permanently fixed to any of the portions of the traps nor will they impede the installation or replacement of a new dispenser. <br />Meets the needs of programs<br />In order to assure the most effective use of tax payer dollars APHIS may institute a Quality Control (QC) program in an attempt to addressproduct reliability. APHIS may monitor the following areas of lure quality:<br />a. Lure shelf life: all dispensers shall exhibit satisfactory shelf life by remaining in compliance with the specifications for at least six months after shipment to the APHIS warehouse, assuming APHIS complies with the manufacturer's recommended storage instructions. Lures may be weighed after coming out of storage at the APHIS warehouse.<br />If a company is found to have provided products that fall outside the prescribed specifications, the company will provide working replacements for these products at no cost to the government. Similarly, if the product is found to have depleted content or cannot meet the needs of the field after 6 months at the manufacturer's recommended storage instructions, the company will replace the product(s) at no cost. If the active component is found to have purity or quality issues at any point during the expected shelf life, the company will provide replacement lures meeting the stated specifications at no cost to the government.<br />At the request of the company, APHIS may provide representative samples of the failed products. The company will be required to arrange for shipping costs and logistics for the transportation of any hazardous material, as APHIS field personnel do not have the required training to ship this material.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>The order will be conditionally accepted at:</p>
<p>USDA APHIS PPQ<br />Edinburg, TX 78541</p>
<p>The conditional acceptance will focus on the following factor:</p>
<p>&bull; Condition of shipping containers upon arrival - those with obvious defects from the shipping process will be rejected. Additional products must be sent to offset this loss at no expense to the government.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. INTRODUCTION<br /></span>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) is investigating the use of a commercially available web service to provide a GIS base layer to support FSA's compliance and other program needs. The objective of this RFI is to investigate whether commercial capability presently exists that can supply current ortho imagery via a web service for a 2012 FSA pilot project.
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to the RFI. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. BACKGROUND<br /></span>FSA state and county offices require current imagery to maintain agriculture field boundaries to support many different farm related programs. For many years, FSA used large 24"x24" black &amp; white hard copy photo maps with hand drawn boundary lines. This transitioned to the use of digital ortho imagery with the introduction of geographic information system (GIS) applications in the mid 1990's. Currently, FSA contracts for new imagery that is acquired on a three-year cycle under the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) which is managed and distributed by the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO).</p>
<p>FSA, as part of its information technology (IT) modernization program, has moved from local storage of geospatial data at the county offices to a thin client based model. In this model, APFO builds web services, which are used daily by the 2000+ FSA state and county offices to maintain centralized vector databases and manage farm programs. Presently FSA maintains the hardware and software infrastructure needed to support web services and is investigating the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web service data solutions (defined as image collection, data hosting, services provisioning, and related services).</p>
<p>The objective of a 2012 pilot project is to address the benefits and issues of moving the web services to a commercial product line in support of FSA's 2012-2016 Strategic Plan Goal 4, migrate to and leverage integrated web based solutions, and the White House's Federal Cloud Computing Strategy (dated Feb 8, 2011). The information collected under this RFI will support a decision on whether a pilot project could be implemented. The goal of the 2012 pilot project, if executed, is to seek metrics regarding return on investment (ROI) and usability versus current imagery acquisition and distribution avenues.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /></span>For purposes of the RFI, FSA would like a COTS web service that can provide current (acquired in 2012), leaf-on, one meter ortho imagery for any one of the eleven 2012 NAIP Priority 1 states. These states (California, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas (preferred), Virginia, and Wyoming) have been chosen to allow FSA to make a direct comparison of the pilot services against the 2012 NAIP collection. FSA would desire an Esri(R) ArcGIS(TM) 10.x and/or OGC compliant web service, in GCS WGS84 projection. The web service should contain both a natural color and false color IR service. If an RFP is released for the referenced web service, the offerors will be responsible for all imagery, whether acquired directly for the contract or licensed from a third-party, and hardware/software infrastructure required to support contractual specifications. Please respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>Web Service Questions:<br />1. How would you propose delivering such a service?<br />2. Please describe the Service Level Agreement (SLA) provided with the service (including the uptime). What kind of customer support would be provided with this service?<br />3. Please describe the security and how you control access to the service.<br />4. Would there be any image analysis, feature extraction, remote sensing, or change detection tools available in the service? Please explain.<br />5. Please describe the infrastructure and software used to build the service and the timelines required to implement the service.<br />6. What type of usage monitoring and metrics would be available to the Government? (i.e. resource metering, quota management, service level monitoring, workload management) <br />7. What kind of metadata would be provided regarding the service?<br />8. Describe what Federal or industry guidelines and standards (i.e. FISMA or OGC) the service(s) comply with.</p>
<p>Imagery Source Questions:<br />9. What state(s) do you currently have imagery for or are planning on having?<br />10. What is the source, resolution, and spatial accuracy of the imagery data?<br />11. What is the age of the imagery and what is the frequency in which the imagery will be updated?<br />12. Please describe radiometric corrections applied to the imagery.<br />13. What is the tiling structure of the data?<br />14. What kind of metadata comes with the imagery data?</p>
<p>Data Licensing Questions:<br />15. Please explain how the data within the service would be licensed. <br />16. Please explain how the service itself would be licensed.</p>
<p>Contractual/Pricing Questions:<br />17. What is the estimated price, assuming an FSA agency only license, for a one year web service? What is the estimated price for a USDA department level wide license buy-up? If the price is based on data volume to customer, please provide price structure.<br />18. What is the estimated price to extend the service availability length with two additional option years?<br />19. Is there a sunset clause in which the data will be placed in public domain after "x" number of years (i.e., after the option years)? If not, would it be possible for the Government to purchase the data rights to release in public domain?</p>

<CONTACT>Amanda J. Rogers, Contract Specialist, Email amanda.rogers@fema.dhs.gov
<DESC>**THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA) WILL TAKE ANY PROCUREMENT ACTION PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER. RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT**<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather pricing information for Vendor Managed Inventory of the FEMA Infant &amp; Toddler Shelter Kit. FEMA is requesting estimated pricing information for a vendor to manage ten (10) Infant and Toddler (I/T) kits. These kits, which include 26 line items, should be readily available to ship to any location in the continental United States or US territories within a 48 hour time frame. (Please see attached kit list) Each kit should be packaged in a tri-wall container with the perishable and non-perishable items segregated. A comprehensive spreadsheet listing all items of the kits to include manufacturer, lot number, and expiration date, will be attached to the exterior of the kits, as well as inside the kit. A copy of the spreadsheet should also be sent to the Contacting Officer's Representative (COR). Separate life-cycle information is required for perishable line items in each kit.
<p>There are nine (9) items that FEMA is requesting a 12 month shelf life from date of award. Those items are I/T #1-7, 16-17, &amp; 23, shown on the attachment. FEMA is willing to accept no less than a nine (9) month shelf life of these perishable items. However, any kits shipped with items that have less than a 12 month shelf life will require a one (1) time refresh of the kits. This shall be completed by the vendor if the kits are stored in a FEMA Distribution Center, via shipping destination or retrograde from disaster site. The refresh will achieve a 12 month shelf life from the original date of award for all perishable items contained in the kit.</p>
<p>Estimated pricing should be per kit to include CONUS transportation and any anticipated re-fresh/life cycle costs.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the service stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice. Small businesses are especially encouraged to respond to this notice.
<p>Operational faults for mechanical systems in office buildings can negatively impact energy consumption, maintenance costs, thermal comfort for the occupants and environmental protection.  Automated commissioning software programs are effective tools for the evaluation of mechanical systems in buildings.  These software programs are designed to aid building operators and commissioning agents to perform semi-automated commissioning tasks.  The software can be used to inject test signals to elicit system responses under different conditions and then to apply expert rules for analysis while requiring only rudimentary information on the hardware and operating setpoints for the systems involved.</p>
<p>In previous years, the Mechanical Systems and Controls Group of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed CITE-AHU.exe, and the BACnet Communications DLL (BCD), to facilitate the analysis and maintenance of air handling units in office buildings.  The CITE-AHU software was developed in partnership with a French research lab (Centre Scientifique et Technique du B&acirc;timent, CSTB), while the BCD was developed solely at NIST.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for the contractor to provide NIST with an updated version of the CITE-AHU application with a graphical user interface that provides all the functionality of the current Version 1.6.  The new version shall be referred to as Version 2.0.  This shall include the source code and all project files associated with the program.  The source code as delivered must compile to the executable.  The delivered software shall be based on the CITE-AHU.exe software.  The structure of the software shall be modular to facilitate functional updates and future expansions.  The contractor may note that some procedures may be performed more efficiently in Visual C++ (or other approved language) than in the original Visual Basic code.  The contractor shall implement the code in the most efficient way.  Note that the intent is to preserve and/or improve the functionality of the code, not to perform a line-by-line translation.   <br />The end software provided by the contractor shall provide the capability for analysis of multiple pieces of equipment in a building or network of buildings.</p>
<p>The software shall be able to reliably perform the data pre-processing and analysis for single-duct air-handling units, provide new graphing capabilities, and be designed and documented in a manner that would facilitate the future expansion to include analysis for other types of mechanical equipment i.e., chillers, variable air volume boxes, dual-duct air handling units, etc.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates using a FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures to award a firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p>The attached draft Statement of Work provides details on this requirement.</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide the necessary support services are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above. The capabilities statement should be tailored to the requirements detailed here.  Responses should include the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to the primary NAICS code 541511 (size standard $25 million), information on any additional small business classifications granted, current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA schedule contracts (if applicable) under which your company can provide the services described in this notice, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.    All responses must be emailed to keith.bubar@nist.gov so that they are received by no later than 5:00 pm EST March 29, 2012.</p>

Of the available strategies, FISCJAX is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, , WomanOwned Small Business (WOSB) Small Business set-aside and/or 8 (a) suitability.
 The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB or Small Business entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. 

From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy. Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your company's business interests. If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis.

<SUBJECT>Slag Pile Removal and Metal Recovery at the Franklin Slag Pile (FSP) Superfund Site
<SOLNBR>SOL-R3-12-00001
<RESPDATE>050412
<CONTACT>Ryan T. Parker, Contract Specialist, Phone 2158145126, Email parker.ryan@epa.gov
<DESC>This Sources Sought is issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 3, Philadelphia, PA. The USEPA is seeking creative and resourceful sources capable of performing the unique requirement of the complete removal of the slag pile from the Franklin Slag Pile Superfund Site, while maximizing the recovery of the metals contained within the slag. The Government anticipates that the salvage value of the metals that are contained within the slag will be used to offset some of the Government's costs for the slag pile removal and disposal.
<p><strong><br />Information about the Site:</strong></p>
<p>The Franklin Slag Pile (FSP) Superfund Site is a remnant from an adjacent former copper smelter site. The approximate volume and weight of the pile is estimated to be 68,000 cubic yards and 108,000 tons and the dimensions of the pile are 200' x 400' x 40' high. The primary contaminant of concern (COC) in the slag is lead. Due to the lead content of the slag pile, all samples collected from the pile have failed both the Toxicity Characteristic Leachate Procedure (TCLP) and Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) tests. During a 1999-2000 EPA Removal Action, the slag pile was consolidated and covered by a 60-mil thick high density polyethylene (HDPE) cover and the site was fenced.<br /><br />Additional information about the site can be found on the internet at:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/PASFN0305549.htm">http://www.epa.gov/reg3hwmd/npl/PASFN0305549.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Statement of Work:</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all tools, supplies, equipment, transportation and labor necessary to perform the complete removal of the slag pile from the Franklin Slag Pile Superfund Site located at 3110 Castor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>The work will include but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Removal and ultimate proper disposal of the existing 60-mil high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane from the slag pile. Removal of the geomembrane shall be performed in such a way as to 1) minimize the creation and migration of dust particles from the pile and 2) minimize the potential for erosion of the pile materials from wind and/or rain.<br />2. Transport of the slag material from the existing pile to either an off-site location for treatment/reuse/disposal or to an on-site location for treatment prior to eventual off-site transport. "Treatment", as it is used here, should be construed to mean use of a process that would either (physically or chemically) render the metal in the pile as non-hazardous or that would physically remove those desirable constituents within the pile, such as copper, lead, etc., that would also result in rendering the remaining materials non-hazardous. All materials require ultimate transport from the site location.<br />3. Removal and proper disposal, of any undesirable (non-slag) materials from within the pile.<br />4. Use of appropriate air monitoring devices to ensure compliance with existing air protection regulations during the work. <br />5. Final restoration of the property to match surrounding grade. <br />6. Preparation of a site health and safety plan (HASP) satisfying the requirements set forth in OSHA standard 29 CFR parts 1910 and 1926, 49 CFR parts 100-199 and 261. The plan will include, among other things, provisions for proper personnel protective equipment, site security, clean-up, decontamination procedures, disposition of waste, hazardous waste spill and decontamination contingency plan and emergency procedures.

This is a 100% total small business set aside. 

This project proposes to redesign and renovate the existing the sixth floor east ward which is currently used mostly as a general medical/general surgical in-patient care ward.  
 This project will demolish the necessary existing walls, electric, lighting, ceiling, floor tile, asbestos mastic and pipe insulation abatement, mechanical equipment, ductwork, and plumbing for approximately 7600 gsf of existing ward space and will redesign a new state of the art ICU which will produce a 15 bed unit with private patient rooms and private baths.  The new ICU will contain all required medical gas, nurse call, and necessary appurtenances for an inpatient ICU care area.

The intent is for the design to occur during FY2012 with construction in FY2013.

<DESC><br />NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA): The Cryptologic Systems Division (CPSD) Contracting Branch, HNCKA, Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX, intends to award on a sole source basis a firm-fixed-price contract for the production of Miniature COMSEC Units (MCU) 110B Products. The Government intends to procure the MCU-110B Product, including flight units, 28 each and engineering units, 10 each. The MCU-110B was developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) L-3 Telemetry West (TW), 9020 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, CA. 92123, CAGE CODE: 9U244, as a propriety product and received National Security Agency (NSA) certification as a Type-1 CRYPTO unit under the NSA Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP). The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one (1) responsible source. The Air Force's lack of complete specifications, schematics/drawings, parts lists and technical expertise precludes the use of Full and Open Competition procedures to satisfy this requirement. L-3 TW is the only vendor known to the Air Force capable of producing the MCU-110B units, because as the OEM it has the required engineering knowledge, expertise, and complete drawing package to do so. An ESC Ombundsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerrors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman, concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for consideration. IAW AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the ability to contact an Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract. The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at: ESC Ombudsman, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731, Telephone 781-377-5106, Facsimile 781-377-4659, Email: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil. If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ralph Urias, 210-977-4913, ralph.urias@lackland.af.mil within fifteen (15) days of this publication. Those interested firms must indicate whether they are a large, small, and small-disadvantaged, 8(a), or women owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office, proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation to conduct an ethnographic study along the proposed and alternative alignments of the Indian Power Company's Boardman to Hemingway 500kv Transmission Line Project (B2H). The goal of the study is to identify the historical, traditional, contemporary, and ongoing religious and cultural significance within the yet to be defined B2H area for consideration in future cultural resource protection decisions to be made by the BLM.The basis for this Notice of Intent to Award Sole-Source to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation is due to the proprietary nature of the information the BLM seeks. The data to be gathered is considered culturally sensitive to the Native American Community and is protected from all members outside of the Tribe. Therefore, an award without competition is deemed necessary.This acquisition is pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c), Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The applicable NAICS code is 541720. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 3:00pm (PST), April 06, 2012 via email to BLM_OR_SO_952@blm.gov  or facsimile at 503-808-6312. Submittals should include the solicitation number L12PS00328, qualifications to fulfill this requirement, and contact information.  Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is needed.

<DESC><strong>INTENT: <br /></strong>The Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) is hosting an Industry Forum to request input regarding current practices and industry best practices in the field of Residential Reentry. The proposed forum will take place July 17 and 18, 2012, at the BOP's National Corrections Academy in Aurora, Colorado. An agenda will be forthcoming. The BOP is updating the current Residential Reentry Center (RRC) Statement of Work (SOW) and would like input from current providers on the content of the SOW and our current solicitation and evaluation practices. Participants are welcome to suggest additional discussion topics to the contracting officer listed in this notice.
<p>In issuing this notice, the BOP is contemplating significant modifications to the current solicitation process. The result may include modifications to the SOW, existing evaluation criteria, and contract monitoring practices. This will allow the BOP to more accurately communicate its requirements for RRC services.</p>
<p>Participation in this Industry Forum is voluntary and not a contractual requirement. Participants must fund their own travel and to the Industry Forum. Due to space limitations, each contractor is limited to no more than 3 participants. If a contractor is unable to attend but would still like to have input in this process, comments regarding agenda topics may be submitted to the contracting officer listed in this notice.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND/DEFINITIONS: <br /></strong>The Bureau contracts with private companies to provide RRC services. These services provide assistance to inmates who are nearing release from Federal custody. RRCs provide a safe, structured, supervised environment, as well as employment counseling, job placement, financial management assistance, and other programs and services. RRCs help inmates to rebuild their ties to the community and facilitate supervising offenders' activities during this readjustment phase. <br />Residential reentry services include managing eligible and appropriate inmates in home detention programs. Home Detention is the least restrictive component of the Residential Reentry Program.</p>
<p>The BOP requires that an offender placed on Home Detention status remain in his/her home when not participating in approved activities, programming requirements, and/or employment. Compliance with the conditions of Home Detention are monitored in accordance with the most current version of the Bureau's RRC SOW, which is attached.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:<br /></strong>If you would like to provide information to be considered for inclusion in the Industry Forum, please submit your responses to any of the following questions electronically to the Contracting Officer listed on this notice:</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) requirements for providing residential reentry center services and/or home detention services? Are you currently providing RRC Services or Home Detention Services to the BOP or to another correctional entity?</p>
<p>What experience do you have in providing residential reentry services (at federal, state, or local levels)?<br /><br />What is your experience using evidence-based practices?<br /><br />What is your experience in using risk assessment tools (e.g. LSIR, SASSI, COMPASS)?<br /><br />What is your experience with data collection practices to support evidence-based programs? <br /><br />Are you familiar with state and local laws pertaining to the implementation and operation of prisoner reentry programs in your area? Describe any potential barriers to establishing this type of program in your area.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are there unique laws or regulations applicable to these services?<br /><br />Do you have suggestions to improve the current RRC SOW?<br /><br />Do you have suggestions to improve government acquisition of residential and/or home detention services? <br /><br />What experience do you have in supervising inmates on home detention? <br /><br />What method of home detention monitoring do you currently use? Do you have experience in supervision using remote electronic monitoring equipment of any kind (e.g., GPS, radio frequency, hybrid systems, etc.)?<br /><br />Are there innovations in home detention that the BOP could benefit from and if so, what are they?<br /><br />Are you familiar with the principles of performance-based service contracting?<br /><br />If you currently provide RRC services via a performance-based contract, what are the benefits and/or challenges you experience with a performance-based contract?<br /><br />What challenges or benefits would be experienced with a 10 - 20 year contract period?<br /><br />Are you familiar with the BOP's current evaluation criteria? In your experience in the field of reentry, are the appropriate evaluation criteria being utilized in the solicitation phase? <br /><br />Are you interested in participating in the proposed industry forum?<br /><br />What topics would you like to discuss with your peers?<br /><br />What topics would you like to discuss with your BOP Partners?</p>
<p><br />Your responses to the above questions will be evaluated and used to formulate an agenda for the Industry Forum. The final agenda and additional details will be available through an amendment to this notice.<br /><br />Attachment - Current RRC SOW</p>

<DESC>The SNL's Europe Financials platform provides comprehensive, accurate and timely financial data, including 500+ items that have been hand-entered into a heavily vetted IFRS/Banking template; Balance sheet by nature (loans, equity security investments) and by classification (held for trading, amortized cost, etc.); breakouts of off-balance-sheet derivative components; Income statement, including standardized pre-impairment operating profit, impairment detail and yield/cost information; detailed credit quality metrics, including gross and net impaired loans, past due loans, etc. SNL Europe provides an events calendar that can be exported to Outlook for European Financials to include: conference calls; earnings releases; company meetings; and industry conferences. OFR will gain access to early morning relevant news from local and major financial papers throughout Europe with translations and links to the original source. A real-time feed of news updates with email alerts is provided, as well as in-depth proprietary reporting specific to European financials. SNL Europe provides a comprehensive listing of 220,000+ branch locations for covered banks, with a summary/mapping of retail branch locations by country. Branch analytics are provided that shows a pro formal deal map on the number of branches two banks have within a specific distance of one another. SNL Europe consolidates all European financial company documents collected from company websites, regulatory bodies, and stock exchanges. This includes but is not limited to: annual, interim and quarterly reports; earnings, M&amp;A and other investor presentations; debt and equity offering prospectuses; financial supplements, earnings/press releases; Basel and Pillar III statements. SNLxl provides an Excel add-in which allows OFR to use software available to all staff to import the data to Excel. The add-in enhances the searching and screening capability of the following datasets: corporate data; financials; market data; M&amp;A; equity issuance transactions; debt and equity issues outstanding. The Excel add-in also provides prebuilt analytical templates to assist in the analysis of the data sets mentioned above. Country profiles allow for in-depth analysis of country specific economic data, banking statistics, domestic league table rankings, largest branch networks, recent merges and equity offerings, industry news, and sovereign ratings. Data for mergers at European financials includes the following: detailed deal comps (current/historic); company merger histories; buyer and seller stock performance; links to relevant deal news; and document and company financials linked to each deal. Peer analytics are available for these European financials, allowing for the creation of relevant peer comparisons using default peer logic or the customization of own peer groups. Additional benchmarking is available using SNL indexes or custom aggregates. Capital markets data specific to Europe is provided on the following: details on debt and equity issues outstanding; debt maturity schedule; rights and other equity offerings, credit ratings from Fitch, Moody's, S&amp;P and DBRS. SNL Europe provides market data specific to European markets, including the following: stock highlights containing portfolio stocks summary, intraday pricing, price leaders and losers, and volume; institutional ownership including individual company ownership and peer comparison analytics; indexes by sector, market cap and geography, prices, total return, dividend yield, betas; and rates and yields, specific to currency exchange rates and LIBOR.
<p>SNL Europe was found to be the single source to provide institutional level European specific data coverage on European financials and markets of quality that meets OFR standards. Market research was conducted and another provider of similar data was located. However, this provider provides only aggregations of the required data and not institutional level data for analytical purposes as required by OFR. In addition, early vintage data (prior to 2001) was not electronically archived and retrieval is not automated, nor is the data assessable in a database. OFR requires the data be assessable through automated methods.<br /><br />A request for more information will not be considered a response. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by the response date.</p>

<DESC><strong><em>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.</em></strong>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education issues a <strong>Request for Information (RFI)</strong> about the subject potential procurement. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is issued under the authority of FAR 15.201("Exchanges of information before receipt of proposals").</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) is the research arm of the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The primary education research programs at IES are supported by the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department is issuing this RFI to solicit ideas and strategies to maximize and enhance ED's management of education and special education research through cataloguing. Specifically, ED is considering support services that will catalogue products from and details about IES grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts.</p>
<p>In order to understand the complexity of IES projects, it is estimated that approximately 250 new projects, including education grants, training grants, Research and Development Centers, and Small Business Innovation Research projects, are awarded each year across NCER and NCSER, in addition to over 700 projects that are ongoing. ED is exploring the need to develop a catalogue of its funded projects to better guide its efforts in identifying areas of future research and manage ongoing projects. [For more information about IES and its funded products, go to the website http://ies.ed.gov/funding.]</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to request information from interested parties, including potential offerors (ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES), about the feasibility of alternative contract arrangements for the development of a catalogue. The Department requests information related to the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Interest in a performance-based contract for the creation of a catalogue; <br />&bull; Personnel required for the creation of a catalogue;<br />&bull; Number of hours required to complete a catalogue and revise or update the catalogue;<br />&bull; Pricing information related to completing a catalogue and revising or updating the catalogue; and<br />&bull; How the development and revising or updating the catalogue should be managed.</p>
<p>Areas in Which Information is Sought</p>
<p>Information and comments are solicited regarding the following Discussion Areas:</p>
<p>Discussion Area 1: Interest in a Performance-Based contract for the creation of a catalogue</p>
<p>1.1 Is there interest in Performance-Based contract arrangements for catalogue development?</p>
<p>1.2 What benefits, problems and/or risks might exist in utilizing Performance-Based contracting techniques for developing catalogues?</p>
<p>Discussion Area 2: Measuring Performance</p>
<p>2.1 What are the key elements of the process of catalogue development that are critical to successful outcomes and results?</p>
<p>2.2 What performance requirements, e.g., tasks and deliverables, are amendable to measurement?</p>
<p>2.3 What standards can or should be used to measure unsatisfactory, satisfactory, and outstanding achievement of the performance requirements identified? [Please provide source of information, i.e., where did the standards shared in this response originate?]</p>
<p>Discussion Area 3: Personnel and time requirements</p>
<p>3.1 Please indicate how much is required to design and populate a catalogue from the resources listed below:<br />3.1.a Types of personnel;<br />3.1.b Number of personnel;<br />3.1.c Level of expertise required; and<br />3.1.d Amount of effort.</p>
<p>3.2 Assuming that data are provided and a basic framework for parts of a catalogue is provided, what additional steps might be required to design a complete catalogue?</p>
<p>3.3 How much time might it take to complete the core tasks for developing a catalogue based on the potential size of the catalogue, e.g., "small" which would have approximately 300 items with 20 tags each, "medium" which would have approximately 500 items with 30 tags each, or "large" which would have approximately 800 items with 50 tags each?</p>
<p>3.4 How much time might it take to complete the core tasks of updating and revising a catalogue based on the following parameters:<br />3.4.a Update a catalogue (e.g., changing "in press" to the year of publication) at least once but no more than six times per year; and<br />3.4.b Revise a catalogue with the addition of 10 tags or identifiers (e.g., adding a new column to each existing entry)?</p>
<p>Discussion Area 4: Pricing Information</p>
<p>4.1 How much would it cost to complete the core tasks for developing a catalogue based on the potential size of the catalogue, e.g., "small" which would have approximately 300 items with 20 tags each, "medium" which would have approximately 500 items with 30 tags each, or "large" which would have approximately 800 items with 50 tags each?</p>
<p>4.2 How much would it cost to revise or update a catalogue? Specifically,<br />4.2.a How much would it cost to update a catalogue once per year?<br />4.2.b How much would it cost to update a catalogue quarterly?<br />4.2.c How much would it cost to revise a catalogue with the addition of 10 tags or identifiers (e.g., adding a new column to each existing entry)?</p>
<p>Discussion 5: Management of Developing and Maintaining Catalogue</p>
<p>5.1 What is the best, most cost-effective method to manage the development and revising or updating a catalogue? Specifically, should these tasks be accomplished by a single contractor or go through multiple contractors?</p>

<DESC>Proposed Title: Advanced Search Technology Solutions Capability Statements
<p><br />Proposed Description:</p>
<p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is seeking information about the existing and emerging technological solutions to support potential advanced search requirements (e.g., conducting e-discovery, enterprise search), of archival records in NARA's legal custody as well as the operational records of the agency. This is a market research initiative to allow us to stay current with this fast-moving technology, and is not supporting a planned procurement at this time.</p>
<p>NARA is inviting interested vendors to provide capability statements of exactly how their advanced search products could be applied to address two scenarios.</p>
<p>- Responding to a request (for example, in the context of a FOIA, eDiscovery, or other special request) for all electronic records in all repositories, in a wide variety of formats, related to a person or topic, with results deduplicated and ranked by relevance. <br />- Identifying electronic records in a wide variety of formats, that cannot be released in full because they contain restricted information (such as information covered by FOIA exemptions) and marking the restricted content within the results returned.</p>
<p>Responses should specifically showcase how a vendor's products can improve the accuracy, completeness, and speed of searching for electronic records across a wide breadth of file types and databases, including structured and unstructured data (e.g., hundreds of millions of government e-mail records). Responses must display an application's auditing, security, indexing and searching functionality, to include full-text searching, stemming, and other techniques for electronic records retrieval. NARA is particularly interested in the latest advanced search and retrieval technologies, including the use of predictive analytics, content clustering, autocategorization, deduplication, metadata generation, and the ability to search across federated content stores.</p>
<p>Responses should be in the form of a white paper no longer than ten pages long in twelve point font. All organizations eligible to conduct business with the Federal Government are invited to respond with the capabilities of their products relevant to NARA's scenarios. Interested organizations must submit responses to Jim McKan, Executive Officer of the Applied Research Division, at jmckan@nara.gov (301 837-0410) by April 2, 2012.</p>
<p>Papers received by the deadline will be reviewed. The government reserves the right to contact any or all of the vendors for additional market research.</p>

<DESC>Subject: <br />Eucalyptus Sole Source Notice of Intent
<p>Reference Number: <br />NB180000-12-01994</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice- Notice of Intent</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of Information Systems Management (OISM), intends to negotiate with Eucalyptus Systems, Inc., on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to purchase Eucalyptus Systems, Inc.'s Eucalyptus Capacity Grade 1 (ECG1) with Standard Support, and EucaStart Consulting Services.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Systems Division (ESD) of the Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking to obtain cloud management software to deploy a hybrid private (on-premise) and public cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) that uses NIST's existing VMware ESX infrastructure and supports AWS-compatible public cloud resources. ESD's goal is to offer NIST's Scientists an on-demand, self-service portal to IT resources using NIST's own IT resources and IT resources in public cloud space.</p>
<p>There are many cloud products in the market place, but NIST has determined Eucalyptus Enterprise Edition is the only IaaS cloud management software currently on the market that is built open source and supports private and public cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain a cloud-based software solution and professional services that will provide an on-demand, self-service Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering to OISM's customers. In particular, NIST requires the contractor to complete a rapid deployment of an on-premise IaaS cloud that:</p>
<p>1. Supports both private and public clouds and KVM and VMware hypervisors under a single cloud management console<br />2. Supports the industry standard Amazon Web Services (AWS) API<br />3. Provides a self-service web interface to allow NIST's users to request, provision, and deploy cloud resources<br />4. Supports cloud resource allocation defined by users and groups<br />5. Provides compute and storage usage data for reporting and chargeback<br />6. Built on open source core cloud management software<br />7. Enable NIST to acquire expertise and gain knowledge on cloud architecture, configuration, and administration</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Eucalyptus Systems, Inc. for this requirement.</p>

Scope of WorkSnow Removal at Cedar Breaks National Monument FY2012Revised 3.20.2012
Cedar Breaks National Monument is located at an elevation of over 10,000 feet. The park is in a remote section of southwestern Utah accessible only by narrow, winding mountain roads. The Cedar Breaks scenic drive closes to vehicular traffic during the winter months (typically December thru April) to allow for winter recreation activities which include snowmobiling, cross country skiing and snowshoeing. These activities take place along the unplowed road surface of state highway 148, also known as the Cedar Breaks scenic drive. During a typical winter, snow depths at the Monument exceed ten feet of snow, with drifting in some areas across the road exceeding 20 feet deep. In order to open the road to vehicular traffic for the summer season, snow must be removed from the road using rotary snow blower(s) that is capable of removing and throwing removed snow at least twenty feet from the roadways and parking areas described below.  During unusually big snow accumulation years "snow cat equipment" (which has a very large front mounted bulldozer like blade and tracks that can efficiently move a large amount of snow)  may also be required to bring snow depths down to a level where a rotary plow can take one "bite" of snow to work most efficiently. This scope of work includes removing snow from fog line to fog line (both travel lanes) using large rotary snow blower equipment along the approximately five miles of state highway 148 within the boundary of Cedar Breaks National Monument.This scope of work also includes removing snow as directed by the National Park Service, Cedar Breaks NM Facility Manager which includes removing snow to the extent possible at the Point Supreme parking area and Point Supreme overlook, the Sunset Point turnout, the Chessman Ridge access road and parking area, the Alpine Pond access road and parking area, along the access service road to the NPS maintenance area, the housing area and VIP loop, the Pt. Supreme campground loop, and the Cedar Breaks ranger station parking area and Caretaker cabin access road.
The Cedar Breaks Facility Manager will provide onsite staff to provide direction, guidance and approval of the work. Snow conditions, depths and consistency will vary from year to year and the amount of snow able to be removed in some areas will vary based upon these conditions, and the equipment used by the Utah Department of Transportation. The Facility Manger will make the final on site decisions as to when the amount of snow removed in specific areas adequately meets the intent of this scope of work.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONSnow Removal CEBR(3/16/2012)
1.   AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:           NATIONAL PARK SERVICE        Cedar Breaks National Monument
2.  NATURE OF ACTION:Requesting approval to use other than full and open competition procedures for: Snow removal using a rotary snow and when needed in very deep snow conditions a snow cat  to remove snow on approx.5 miles of roadway on State Route 148 within the boundaries of Cedar Breaks National Monument.  Secondary to removing snow along the scenic drive , snow will also be removed on scenic drive pullouts and parking areas, and other in park access routes as described later in this document.  The work will be accomplished by providing at least one, heavy equipment grade, rotary snow blower(s) and snow cat(s) when needed during heavy snow winters. This equipment is typical of the type used to clear other state highways for safe vehicular use. This includes providing qualified operator(s) fuel and transportation to accomplish the work described below.
Depending upon the depth of snow on the Cedar Breaks Scenic Drive (aka State Route 148) "snowcat" equipment may be required to be utilized to remove enough of the snow at the major snow drifts and along the unplowed road surface to allow the  Utah Dept of Transportation (UDOT) rotary snowplow to be able to efficiently and safely remove the remaining snow from along the park road and NPs facility access routes. A snowcat has very large front mounted bulldozer like blade and tracks that can efficiently move a large amount of snow. 
Under this contract, the NPS COR will work with the local UDOT crew manager to evaluate the snow depths along the entire road covered under this contract and determine if a snowcat work will be required to remove snow to the depth needed for rotary plow work to begin. UDOT is equipped to handle both types of snow removal required by the NPS. UDOT is reimbursed for the actual costs for services rendered with no additional profit sought. Invoices  will reflect only the actual charges incurred for equipment , operator, fuel and any legitimate transportation costs.  UDOT is the only entity that can provide these snow removal services which include both the snow cat and rotary plows.
3. DESCRIPTION:Cedar Breaks National Monument is located at an elevation of over 10,000 feet. The park is in a remote section of southwestern Utah accessible only by narrow, winding mountain roads. The Cedar Breaks scenic drive closes to vehicular traffic during the winter months (typically December thru April) to allow for winter recreation activities  Which includesnowmobiling, cross country skiing and snowshoeing. These activities take place along the unplowed road surface of state highway 148, also known as the Cedar Breaks scenic drive. During a typical winter, snow depths at the Monument exceed ten feet of snow, with drifting in some areas across the road exceeding 20 feet deep. In order to open the road to vehicular traffic for the summer season, snow must be removed from the road using rotary snow blower(s) that is capable of removing and throwing removed snow at least twenty feet from the roadways and parking areas described below.  During unusually big snow accumulation years  a snow cat will also be used to bring snow depths down to a level where  a rotary plow can take one "bite" of snow to work most efficiently. The scope of work includes removing snow from fog line to fog line (both travel lanes) using large rotary snow blower equipment along the approximately five miles of state hwy 148 within the boundary of Cedar Breaks National Monument.Within the park boundary, the work also includes removing snow to the extent possible at the Point Supreme parking area and Point Supreme overlook, the Sunset Point turnout, the Chessman Ridge access road and parking area, the Alpine Pond access road and parking area. This work also includes removing snow as directed by the National Park Service, Cedar Breaks NM Facility Manager along the access service road to the NPS maintenance area, the housing area and VIP loop, the Pt. Supreme campground loop, and the Cedar Breaks ranger station parking area and Caretaker cabin access road.Estimated value is $15,000.00 to $30,000.00
4.  AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as stated in FAR 6.302-1Only one responsible source, Utah Department of Transportation, and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements.
5.  PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS (FAR 6303-2(a) (5)): The Utah Dept of Transportation (UDOT) staffs and maintains a remote high elevation road maintenance facility which is located less than 3 miles from the park's southern boundary. UDOT routinely uses this facility as a home base and utilizes large rotary snow removal equipment to remove deep snow from other roads in the Cedar Mountain area throughout the winter months. They are the only source to provide this type of service to get the parks road open using the required type of equipment and experienced and certified operators who are also knowledgeable about the parks winding and narrow road. .Only UDOT crews or in certain circumstances operators certified by UDOT can legally maintain these State highway routes,In order to meet the park's typical Memorial Day opening for the summer visitor use season, the park maintenance staff must be able to access the monument's buildings and facilities, water system etc at least three weeks prior to opening day. This allows time to clear snow around buildings, disinfect and recharge water systems, bring housing units back on line and a host of other needs. If the main road is not plowed in a timely manner, the park would be unable to open for visitors. In addition, the park also hires seasonal employees and completes hiring paperwork by early April. Many of these employees live on site at the Monument in park housing due to the remote location and long distances to developed communities where rental housing would be available. Many of these seasonal employees live in other states, and the housing rented at the park is the only housing option available to them. If the Monument facilities are not available for them to use, temporary, short term housing would need to be secured by the park which would be impossible to secure on such short notice.
6.  DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE (FAR 6.303-2 (a) (6)): This requirement could not be solicited to any other vendors. UDOT is the legal entity and sole source provider. Only UDOT crews or in certain circumstances operators certified by UDOT can legally maintain these State highway routes, including  the portions of highway which connect on both the south and north boundaries to the NPS scenic drive. This is critical to perform these tasks without damage to the road. No other vendor is available to solicit for snow removal using a rotary plow and as stated above. A notice of intent to award sole source will be publicized as required by FAR 5.201.
7. ANTICIPATED COSTS TO THE GOVERNMENT/ FAIR AND REASONABLENESS (FAR 6.303-2(a) (7)): The complete purchase totals not to exceed $30,000 from Utah Department of Transportation. A separate determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
8.  MARKET RESEARCH (FAR 6.303-2(2)(8)): Extensive research was accomplished which no other feasible sources were found. The Utah Department of Transportation was found to be the exclusive source for the requirement.
9.  OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)): The Utah Department of Transportation is the only available source for this requirement. As stated above,  Only UDOT crews or in certain circumstances operators certified by UDOT can legally maintain these State highway routes,ay and they stated that they were unaware of any other agency that operated large enough equipment to handle the heavy snows that fall at such a high elevation. Note that Hwy 148, the Monument's "scenic drive", is signed on the road and on state maps as a state highway. Due to the heavy snowfall, a large rotary type plow is the only piece of equipment that can safely and completely clear the roadway of snow. The sections of road which connect at the northern and southern boundaries of  Cedar Breaks must be cleared by UDOT crews prior to snow blowing the five miles of scenic drive. The same situation exists on the north end of the park where the park road connects to many miles of UDOT maintained state highway. No other entity has large enough equipment and operators within a reasonable commuting area, nor have the intrinsic knowledge of what it takes to remove snow along this road. Snowcat equipment as earlier described may also be needed if determined necessary by the NPS and UDOT to knock down the very high drifts that cross the road. In big snow years drifts can exceed 20 to 30 feet in depth. But this type of equipment alone is not capable of completely clearing the road of snow due to the caterpillar like tracks they use which would damage the road. In addition, snowcats push the snow with a large blade, and would quickly run out of room to store the snow they remove from the highway. The rotary plow throws the snow twenty to thirty feet, like a snow blower you'd use at home but much bigger. This effectively cuts a path through the snow and makes safe vehicular travel possible once high elevation dries out the asphalt roadway	
10.  ACTION, IF ANY, BEING TAKEN TO REMOVE AND OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)): Additional market research and sources sought will be conducted if subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services are required.
11.  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION (FAR 6.303- 2(b)): I hereby certify that this justification and approval for other than full and open competition is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement. I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advanced planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (PMA 226), H-46 Program Office, will be hosting an H-46 helicopter International Day on the afternoon of Monday, 16 April 2012. This event is scheduled concurrently with, and in close proximity to, the 2012 Navy League Sea-Air-Space Exposition which will be held in the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center, National Harbor, Maryland. The exact location is still to be determined and will be announced via separate notice.<br /><br />As the US Marine Corps' medium-lift Fleet transitions to the MV-22 Osprey, H-46 aircraft will be available for Foreign Military Sales (FMS). An International Day will be conducted to provide an opportunity for interested representatives to view a static display of the aircraft, discuss the capabilities of the H-46 with aircrew and maintainers, and interact with potential industry partners.<br />The H-46 is a tandem rotor helicopter powered by the T58 engine that provides medium lift capability and dynamic versatility. As the workhorse of the Marine Corps aviation fleet, the H-46 supports diverse missions including, but not limited to, combat troop insertion and assault support, search and rescue (SAR), casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), transport of equipment and supplies, VIP transport, and worldwide humanitarian assistance.<br /><br />The US Marine Corps has made substantial investments in the H-46, making the aircraft that are leaving the United States inventory the safest, most capable H-46's ever to have flown. Rigorous depot-level maintenance has yielded an airframe with potentially unlimited service life. With a robust industrial base, low maintenance man-hours per flight hour and cost per flight hour, and high operational availability, the H-46 is a superior medium-lift helicopter for United States allies and partners.<br /><br />Attendees to this event will be provided access to the aircraft via a static display. Senior U. S. military pilots and aircrew will be on hand to discuss capabilities and to answer questions about recent deployments and operational considerations. This event will also be an opportunity for members of industry to interact with PMA 226 representatives, members of the security assistance community, and potential FMS customers. It is anticipated that there will be multiple countries that are interested in procuring these aircraft via the FMS process. Future H-46 FMS may generate opportunities for commercial industry to provide a broad spectrum of supplies and services including, but not limited to, all levels of aircraft maintenance, modifications, supply support, transportation, in country technical support, transportation, training, and engineering, logistics, or other technical assistance. <br /><br />Depending on the number of responses, vendors may be allowed to set up displays/exhibits in the static display area for this event. <br /><br />Pre-registration for the H-46 International Day is required.

<DESC>It is PEO STRI's intent to off-load the requirement to North Atlantic Treaty Organization Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NATO C3A) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) 11498<br><br>Closing Date: 05 April 2012<br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:<br><br>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (CTIS), has a validated requirement to field an additional 900 PRTLS radios and associated accessories to the U.S. Army's JMRC at Hohenfels, Germany.  A CTIS project team fielded the initial 765 PRTLS radios and modified the communications network at the JMRC in 2009. The existing Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) communications infrastructure at JMRC required that only certain radio technology be employed to meet technical requirements of this infrastructure and to comply with German spectrum requirements. In short, the PRTLS radio for JMRC is a unique device which is only used at JRMC.  The original contractor, Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC) selected a vendor, Sepura PLC, who was able to cost effectively adapt one of its existing products to satisfy the JMRC PRTLS' requirement.<br><br>This procurement of 900 radios and accessories must also employ the same non-standard, TETRA-based radio architecture, operating on the appropriate radio frequencies (366 MHz to 371 MHz), that is tailored to operate on and be compatible with the existing JMRC communications infrastructure and training environment. It must be already approved, via the JF-12 process, by the German National Radio Frequency Office (NARFA) and must meet U.S. Army safety requirements by possessing a safety confirmation.      <br><br>These PRTLS radios are an integral part of the  JMRC Instrumentation System (JMRC-IS) which collects, processes, displays, and stores training performance data from Soldiers performing live, collective training at the JMRC.  The PRTLS radios perform an essential function in these training exercises by collecting training data from vehicles and dismounted Soldiers, and relaying that information to the Core of the JMRC-IS for use in monitoring the training exercise and providing After Action Review (AAR) feedback to the Soldiers in training.  <br><br> The following list identifies the type, quantities, components and capabilities of the required PRTLS capability:<br>  <br>(1)  900 JMRC Instrumentation System-compatible radios.<br>(2)  900 antennas.<br>(3)  3,600 high capacity batteries.<br>(4)  38 high-capacity, 24-way battery chargers.<br>(5)  450 protective radio pouches (for dismounted Soldiers).<br>(6)  450 vehicle mounting containers/tubes.<br>(7)  One-year radio and antenna warranty; options for two and three additional years.<br><br>The technical requirements for the PRTLS radios and accessories are:<br><br>(1)  Radio requirements.<br>		<br>a)	Approved by the National Radio Frequency Agency (NARFA) for use in Germany.<br>b)	Enhanced GPS with integrated option of -182 dBw acquisition sensitivity and 185 dBw tracking sensitivity.

The contractor should consider the need to work with the WarFighter FOCUS (WFF) contractor, i.e., the JMRC-IS sustainment contractor, at the JMRC.  The WFF contractor is the Subject Matter Expert for the JMRC-IS, including the PRTLS and the communications infrastructure. The WFF contractor also maintains the JMRC-IS software, and is the only one allowed to modify the software.  If any software documentation must be modified, such as Interface Control Documents, the contractor must work with the WFF contractor to update these documents. <br><br>	(d)  The contractor will prepare test plans and conduct Government-witnessed testing to verify correct functionality and compatibility of the radio with the JMRC-IS. <br><br>	(e)  The contractor will be required to provide Logistics Management Information for the solution provided, and to update existing technical documentation or prepare new documentation as appropriate.<br><br>	(f)  The contractor will prepare New Equipment Training (NET) documentation for delivery to the Government, and will conduct NET at the JMRC. The NET will include separate courses for the operators and maintainers if the radio is not the same as the PRTLS radio currently used at the JMRC.     <br><br>	(g)  The contractor will host one-day Program Management Reviews about every three months to discuss status of program, issues, and cost, schedule, and performance factors; Technical Interface Meetings (TIMs) in conjunction with PMRs to discuss technical requirements and issues, and Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs) before any testing is executed. All of these meetings are normally held at the location where the work is being accomplished. <br><br>Acquisition Approach: The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via North Atlantic Treaty Organization Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NATO C3A) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) 11498 in accordance with FAR Part 16.505.    The Government anticipates a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery order.  The period of performance will be for no more than nine (9) months. <br><br>Quantities: The Government plans to procure 900 PRTLS radios plus accessories as outlined in the Program Description.<br><br>Estimated Dollar Value:  $1.5M  <br>  <br>Reponses shall include:<br>A capabilities statement that includes Company information, including name, address, and URL, whether the company is a manufacturer or distributor, and business size; a description of the product detailing how the offered product meets the above requirements; an approved JF-12, which has been processed through the German National Radio Frequency Office (NARFA) for approval, for the radio; and a U.S. Army-approved safety confirmation for the radio.      <br> <br>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Bio-Rad Laboratories, Life Science Group, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA 94547, for Item 1855195, CFX96 Touch System, which includes #1707369, computer laptop with operational software, installation, and training. (PC laptop with Intel Core 2 Duo T8100 2.1GHz, 800 MHz Bus Speed, Intel GM965 Express chipset, 2.5 GB memory, 160GB serial ATA 5400 rpm hard drive, DVD-Writer dual layer, 15.4&rdquo; WXGA widescreen active Matrix TFT color LCD display screen, shared graphics, wireless, firewire, keyboard, Windows XP Professional 32bit.) Unit must be able to open and analyze existing Bio-Rad IQ data files that have been compiled in past years with Bio-Rad instruments. Unit optical system must allow excitation and detection of up to five fluorescent dyes in a single reaction well. Unit optics shuttle must independently illuminate and detect fluorescence from each well using a system of six filtered LEDs for illumination which differentially detects emission using six filtered photodiodes (one for each channel). Unit has a fixed optical path, directly over each well, eliminating the need to normalize for positional bias. One change is dedicated for FRET experiments-illuminates dyes with absorption spectra in the 450-490 nm range and detects dyes with emission spectra in the 560-580 nm range. System reads all 96 wells in all channels within 12 seconds. In fast scan mode, the system reads all 96 wells within 3 seconds. Has linear dynamic range of 10 orders of magnitude for detection of input samples. Detects one copy of target sequence in human genomic DNA. Detects less than or equal to 10 fmol of fluorescein. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may use e-mail to identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement before the expiration date of the advertisement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(2) When used in best value source selections, past</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(1) The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will evaluate a</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">contractor_s past performance, including, but not limited to,</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">their record of conforming to specifications, conformance to</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">the standards of good workmanship, adherence to contract</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction. DLA will</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">utilize the following information systems in evaluation of</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(ABVS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System -</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR).</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(2) The ABVS is the DLA Legacy computerized past performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">system that collects a contractor_s existing past performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">data and translates it into a numeric score. The contracting</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">officer then uses the score as an additional evaluation</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">factor when making best value award decisions.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(3) The PPIRS-SR is a web-enabled, government-wide</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">application that collects quantifiable delivery and quality</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">contractor past performance information from the Department</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(4) Definitions:</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">performance on past DLA contracts.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(ii) 'Classification(s),' as used in this provision, refers</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">to the PPIRS-SR assessment of a contractor_s delivery and</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">quality performance on past DoD contracts, including DLA.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(5) ABVS Scores:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(i) DLA assigns an ABVS score to each contractor based on</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">the contractor_s past performance. Contractors receive scores</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">for performance in each Federal Supply Class (FSC scores).</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The FSC scores are based on DLA consolidated performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">history. A contractor may have multiple FSC scores but will</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">have only one DLA score, which is a compilation of the</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">contractor_s FSC scores for all business conducted with DLA.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(ii) The ABVS score is a combination of a vendor's delivery</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">and quality scores; scores range from zero to a perfect score</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">of 100.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(iii) Scores are calculated daily based upon two years of</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">data.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(iv) ABVS delivery scores provide quantification of the</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">number and severity of contractor-caused delinquencies,</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">terminations, cancellations, and withdrawals for products in</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">DLA within the time period under consideration).</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(v) ABVS quality scores reflect the number and type of</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">quality complaints (product and packaging nonconformances)</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">issued against a contractor for products in that FSC or for</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">all products it provided to DLA, as described in (iv), above.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(vi) Data sources for past performance information include:</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(C) DLA Preaward Contracting System (DPACS).</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(vii) DLA will make negative quality and delivery data</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">reflected in the ABVS score available to contractors daily</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">for review and challenge.</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">to the ABVS website.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(6) PPIRS-SR Classifications</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(i) PPIRS-SR classifications are based on Federal Supply</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Class (FSC).</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(ii) Classifications are calculated monthly based upon three</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">years of data.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(iii) PPIRS-SR Classifications are comprised of a Delivery</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Score and a Quality color ranking.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(iv) The PPIRS-SR delivery score is based upon the total</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">number of contract line items received and on weighted late</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">deliveries.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(v) The contractor quality performance ranking is based upon</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">a comparison among all contractors within an FSC.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(vi) Data sources for past performance information include:</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(viii) For details concerning PPIRS-SR Classification</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">calculations and contractor data challenge procedures, refer</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(7) Evaluation Using ABVS Scores and PPIRS-SR</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Classifications</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(i) The Contracting Officer will first evaluate contractors</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">using the ABVS FSC score for the solicited FSC in effect at</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">the time of evaluation. The Contracting Officer will use a</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">contractor_s DLA score to evaluate a contractor without an</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">FSC score for that particular FSC. The Contracting Officer</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">may consider the volume of business on which the FSC score is</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">based as a measure of confidence in the score_s indication of</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">performance risk. The Contracting Officer may choose to use</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">the DLA score if the volume of business would tend to make</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">the FSC-specific score an inadequate indicator of performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">risk. The Contracting Office also may use the DLA score if</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">the FSC scores among contractors are relatively equal. For</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">non-NSN items, the Contracting Officer will evaluate using a</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">contractor_s DLA score in effect at the time of evaluation.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Contractors with no performance history for the particular</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">FSC or any other FSC, Agency-wide, for the timeframe being</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">rated will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably,</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">and will be assigned a '999.9' in ABVS.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(ii) In order for the Government to assess performance risk,</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">if the quoter/offeror having the lowest evaluated price also</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">has an ABVS FSC score below 70 and would potentially be</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">bypassed under best value in favor of a higher priced</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">quoter/offeror with a higher ABVS FSC score, then past</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">performance evaluation will be accomplished using PPIRS-SR,</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">in lieu of ABVS, for all quotes/offers received.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(iii) Evaluation of PPIRS-SR delivery assessments will be</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">based upon a numerical scale ranging from 0 (low) to 100</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(high). A _0_ (zero) delivery score with '0_ (zero) lines is</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">used to designate instances wherein the contractor has no</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">history for the particular FSC being rated.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(iv) In PPIRS-SR, contractor quality will be assessed based</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">upon relative ranking among all contractors within a given</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">FSC.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(v) In the case of a contractor without a record of relevant</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">past performance or for whom information on past performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">is not available in the PPIRS-SR, the contractor will be</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">performance.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(vi) Contractor caused discrepancies or delinquencies will be</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">reflected in a contractor's past performance assessment.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Repair, replacement or reimbursement of quality and packaging</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">defects will not provide relief of negative DLA performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">data. Contractor caused delivery extensions, regardless of</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">consideration paid, will be reflected in the delivery score.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">(8) The Contracting Officer may collect and analyze other</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">information in addition to ABVS/PPIRS-SR past performance</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">information for requisitions in excess of the SAT.</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day.?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Prospective contractors are not eligible for an award, if their ORCA information is not current. Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative. The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation. FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous, and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.  This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.

<p>Only with Contracting Officer approval to proceed will a contractor, technical representative, or subcontractor be reimbursed for reasonable per diem cost (transportation, travel expenses, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses) required in connection with the associated change order. Per Diem costs are considered reasonable, allowable and reimbursable only to the extent that they do not exceed the allowed per diem rate in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations, Joint Travel Regulations, or Standardized Regulations as set forth in FAR 31.205-46</p>
<p>Firm Fixed Price Total (includes all charges): tiny_mce_marker__________________.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:<br />Offeror must submit, in detail, a technical understanding of the overall scope of work and the plan to accomplish that work. Technical understanding includes the following: Identifying potential problem areas in accomplishing the work requirements, e.g., Long Lead Time Material, open and inspect items, etc, and propose solutions to those problems; demonstrate an understanding of the engineering support requirements (e.g., work drawings, tech/system manuals).</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL:<br />Offeror must submit, in detail, recent and relevant past performance documentation. Recent is defined as contract completion within the last three (3) years.

<p>PRICE EVALUATION<br />The Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedure is applied to known, firm requirements, usually readily available in the commercial marketplace where a fair and reasonable price determination is based on adequate price competition. Therefore, price analysis per FAR 15.404-1(b) will normally be used to determine the total evaluated price to support the selection of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. Although in exceptional cases when the determination of fair and reasonable price requires additional information, the PCO may conduct a cost analysis per FAR 15.404-1(c) to support the determination of whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p><br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>252.201-7000 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (DEC 1991)</p>
<p>(a) "Definition. Contracting officer's representative" means an individual designated in accordance with subsection 201.602-2 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and authorized in writing by the contracting officer to perform specific technical or administrative functions.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contracting Officer designates a contracting officer's representative (COR), the Contractor will receive a copy of the written designation. It will specify the extent of the COR's authority to act on behalf of the contracting officer. The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or changes that will affect price, quality, quantity, delivery, or any other term or condition of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>

NOAA will deliver the vessel to the<br />Contractor's facility, and redelivery will also be at the Contractor's facility. The required performance<br />period for all work defined is 30 days.<br />4] Coordination of the work schedules will be the responsibility of the Contractor to avoid any delays or<br />disruptions in order to meet the performance period. The Contractor will provide all facilities, labor,<br />materials, tools, and services required to complete the work UNLESS exceptions are noted in the<br />specified tasks below.<br />5] Upon arrival at the Contractor's facility the contractor will accept full responsibility for the safety of<br />the vessel, including but not limited to fire protection, security patrols, water&#8208;tight integrity, protection<br />from adverse environmental conditions, etc. This responsibility will terminate only after all work<br />defined herein (or added during the work period) is complete, accepted by NOAA, and NOAA personnel<br />remove the vessel from the Contractor's facility.<br />6] NOAA employees and contractors may be working on board the vessel during the contract<br />performance period on a not to interfere basis. During this period it will be required that these<br />personnel have full access to the vessel during normal working hours.<br />7] If the vessel is hauled from the water, the Contractor will ensure that all machinery and equipment<br />used for that purpose is fully functional, suitable for the task, rated for loads at least 20% greater than<br />the maximum weight of the vessel, and operated by trained, competent personnel. The NOAA COTR will<br />provide a docking plan for the vessel if requested.<br />8] The government reserves the right to award some or all tasks defined herein, and to add tasks during<br />the work period so long as period of performance revisions, if any, are mutually agreed.<br />9] All work performed under this SOW (or added to it during the period of performance) will meet or<br />exceed all current requirements of ABYC and USCG (Subchapter T) as applicable to this size and type of<br />vessel, in addition to any specific requirements stated below.<br />10] In the event defects or damage unrelated to the work tasks defined below are discovered, the<br />Contractor will submit a Condition Found Report (CFR) to the COTR. The CFR will define corrective<br />actions needed, the cost for that work (separated into labor, materials, services, and total), and the<br />impact to the performance period.<br />2<br />11] All welding required as part of the tasks defined below will be performed by welders certified by ABS<br />or USCG working in accordance with welding procedures approved by ABS or USCG. Copies of<br />certifications and procedures will be provided to the COTR before work commences.<br />B] SPECIFIC WORK TASKS<br />1] Haul, clean, block, store, and launch:<br />Remove the vessel from the water. Pressure&#8208;wash the entire hull from sheer line to keel removing all<br />dirt, grime, and marine growth. If the vessel is a catamaran, clean all surfaces within the tunnel.<br />Similarly, clean all fittings below waterline, including propulsor components, struts, stern tubes, rudders,<br />foils, fins, through&#8208;hulls, etc. If the vessel is fitted with waterjet propulsors, clean the interior of the jets.<br />Do not damage any existing anti&#8208;fouling paint unless further tasks in this SOW require its removal. Clean<br />transducers with a non&#8208;metallic brush, taking care to not mar the emitting surface in any way. Clean all<br />surfaces of all anodes with a wire brush unless they are to be replaced.<br />Block the vessel in a level attitude with the keel (or keels) 36" minimum off the ground. Inspect the hull,<br />coatings, and all attachments and report any damage or discrepancies to the COTR in writing. Provide<br />electrical power to the vessel suitable for its shore power system.<br />Upon completion of all work done on the hard, launch the vessel, inspect all compartments for leaks,<br />and secure it dockside. If dockside testing or underway trials are required after launch, provide prior<br />notification to the COTR so NOAA personnel can attend.<br />2] Underbody coating system:<br />Prepare and touch&#8208;up and flaws in the underbody coating system with the same coating as currently<br />applied. Manufacturer's procedures will be used in all cases. Color to match existing coatings. The<br />contractor will ensure that all the environmental conditions are within the manufacture's specified<br />parameters prior to starting application processes and for all coatings. A written "as&#8208;cleaned" condition<br />report shall be submitted to the COTR prior to painting.<br />3] Inspect all seacocks:<br />Open, actuate, and visually inspect all seacocks in the hull bottom and topsides. A written report shall<br />be submitted to the COTR detailing the location and condition of seacocks, and recommending any<br />corrective action required. Include quotes for all recommended repairs.<br />4] Modify multi&#8208;beam mount<br />Remove the upper portion of the multi&#8208;beam transducer housing, lowering the watertight side walls to a<br />position 4" above static full load waterline, and reconstitute the upper flange. Revise the brackets and<br />mounting tabs to allow the transducer to be removed while the vessel is waterborne without causing<br />flooding of the bilge. The modified transducer mounting plate will be installed with rubber grommets<br />and plastic sleeves to reduce transducer vibration and galvanically isolate fasteners. Install a welded<br />loop or eye on the inside of the transducer well, and install a 1/8" stainless steel cable safety lanyard to<br />the transducer mounting plate.<br />Note: Provide drawings of all proposed modification to the COTR prior to commencing work.<br />Reinstall the transducer. Upon launch test transducer operation at speeds up to 8 knots to prove<br />adequate function. Run the vessel to maximum speed with the transducer shutdown to prove no<br />excessive vibrations or noise is generated.<br />3<br />5] Service waterjets<br />Replace all internal and external anodes on both jets. Replace the water seals, oil seals, thrust bearings,<br />and seal sleeves in both jets. Replace the steering cranks on both jets. This work will include the<br />replacement of associated nylon locking fasteners, gaskets, and O&#8208;rings as required. Upon launching of<br />the vessel, test both jets at all speeds and throughout their maneuvering range to demonstrate full<br />function.<br />6] Realign P&amp;S engines<br />Realign the main engines to the waterjets by shifting their position in the hull. If required, revise the<br />engine bearers and/or vibration mount bolting holes to retain full strength and support. The clutch<br />output flanges and jet input flanges will be aligned parallel to within 0.003" as measured at diametrically<br />opposed edges of the flanges, and flange longitudinal centerline offset will be held to within the<br />tolerance of the drive shaft U&#8208;joints. See notes from Precision Maintenance Inc. alignment performed<br />9/21/11. Alignment notes are included in the SOW, pages 4 and 5. Additionally, and if required,<br />reposition the engine&#8208;driven hydraulic pump and any other engine&#8208;driven equipment to maintain<br />alignments. Upon launch of the vessel, measure alignment and adjust while water&#8208;borne to tolerances<br />stated above. After all alignment work is complete, trial the vessel at all speeds to prove accurate<br />alignment and full function of machinery.<br />7] Install GFM inverter/charger<br />Remove the existing inverter/charger in the vessel and replace it with the unit supplied by the<br />government. Provide all other parts required to complete the installation. Where required, upgrade<br />breakers, cables, and wires associated with the inverter/charger to meet all applicable standards of<br />ABYC and USCG. Upon completion, test the unit to prove full function in both inverter and charger<br />modes.<br />8] Install bilge alarms<br />Install an additional float switch in the forward void, the tank room, and the engine room, these to<br />function as a high bilge water alarm sensors. Position these switches 4" above the existing bilge pump<br />actuation switches and in a secure location in the aft sections of each compartment. Install a small<br />indicator panel (or three separate panels) in the console and wire these to the alarm new sensors.<br />Panels will provide audible and visual indication that the sensors have been tripped, and a mute button<br />for the audible function only. The panels will be positioned and labeled to denote location in the hull.<br />Power for the sensors and panels may be taken off the bilge pump circuits or a new circuit if space is<br />available. Upon completion test each sensor and panel to prove complete functionality.<br />*End of Scope of Work*<br />Laser Alignments &bull; In-field Balancing &bull; Vibration Diagnostics<br />Visit us at www pminw.com<br />COMPANY: N.O.A.A SHIP/PLANT: Tatoosh R/V DATE: 09/21/2011<br />MACHINE Port M/E to R/G SPEED: 2200 Rpm TECHNICIAN: Troy Stocks<br />UNITS: ENGLISH / METRIC<br />FOOT POSITION<br />VERTICAL HORIZONTAL<br />OFFSET ANGULARITY ALIGNMENT AT THE COUPLING (@ 10")<br />VERTICAL HORIZONTAL<br />ANGULARITY OFFSET ANGULARITY OFFSET<br />Initial Cold -30 235 -75 36<br />Final Cold -5 110 -20 49<br />Initial Hot<br />Final Hot<br />TARGETS / TOLERANCES<br />+/-5 100+/-3 +/-5 +/-3<br />NOTES: Alignment was corrected to the angle of 1.5 vertical.

508 STATEMENT:
The customer for this requirement is Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN) in Monterey, Ca.
 The mission of FLENUMMETOCCEN is to collect, interpret, and apply global atmospheric / oceanographic data / information in support of strategic and tactical warfare and peace-keeping initiatives. FLENUMMETOCCEN is the Department of Defense's (DoD) principal operational processing center for automated numerical meteorological and oceanographic analyses and predictions. Around-the-clock operational oceanographic and meteorological support is provided to the US Navy, other US Government agencies, as well as elements of the armed forces of allied nations. This support consists of running regularly scheduled large environmental numerical global forecast models for ships, aircraft, and other forces throughout the DoD.
 Greater emphasis on preparation of, and reaction to, regional conflicts and the littoral threat has resulted in a greatly increased demand for high resolution coupled model meteorological guidance and forecasts, as well as oceanographic support to tactical coastal operations.

FLENUMMETOCCEN requires Mathworks MATLAB licenses software and maintenance. The software and maintenance provided by this procurement is in direct support of the Fleet Numerical mission. FLENUMMETOCCEN is using the equipment to provide weather and oceanographic data to ships at sea and troops in the field. As such, the Nation Security System exemption applies.

PAPERLESS CONTRACTING
ALL CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS (I.E.
 CONTRACTS, PURCHASE ORDERS, TASK ORDERS, DELIVERY ORDERS AND MODIFICATIONS) RELATED TO THE INSTANT PROCUREMENT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE "ISSUED" BY THE GOVERNMENT WHEN COPIES ARE EITHER DEPOSITED IN THE MAIL, TRANSMITTED BY FACSIMILE, OR SENT BY OTHER ELECTRONIC COMMERCE METHODS, SUCH AS EMAIL.  THE GOVERNMENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE CONTRACTOR'S PROPOSAL CONSTITUTES BILATERAL AGREEMENT TO "ISSUE" CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AS DETAILED HEREIN.

BRAND NAME STATEMENT
The Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN) modeling, climatology, and satellite teams require MATLAB software to perform analyses to improve climatology accuracy and product support.
 Other software tools were investigated, but MATLAB is widely used software tool for large data set visualization and analysis. In addition, the Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System Wave Watch 3 Grid generation tool is run using MATLAB; without MATLAB, this tool cannot be run operationally. Further, FLENUMMETOCCEN's partners, including the Naval Research Laboratory and Naval Postgraduate School, use MATLAB in their work; this procurement will allow FLENUMMETOCCEN's scientific community to collaborate with their partners locally.

<p>g.&nbsp; Forms Submission <br />The contractor shall submit a cover sheet, including the contract number, name, and social security number of all contract employees for whom they are requesting a suitability determination, along with completed forms and one FD-258 fingerprint chart to:</p>
<p>SSA<br />CPSPM Security and Suitability Team<br />6401 Security Boulevard<br />Room 1260 Dunleavy Building<br />Baltimore, MD&nbsp; 21235</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the contractor must submit a copy of the cover sheet to the COTR.</p>
<p>The contractor must submit these forms at least 15 days prior to the date work is to begin.&nbsp; For new contract employees who will need access to an SSA facility, site, information, or system, the contractor must submit these forms at least 15 days prior to beginning work under the contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>h.&nbsp; Preliminary Suitability Determination<br />A Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint check will be used as part of the basis for making a preliminary suitability determination.&nbsp; If SSA makes a favorable preliminary suitability determination, the individual may perform under the contract pending SSA's final suitability determination.&nbsp; CPSPM will notify contractors, with carbon copy (cc) notifications sent to both the COTR and CO, of the results of these determinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SSA requires each contractor employee who will have access to a facility, site, system, or information to present two forms of identification after the contractor employee receives notification of a preliminary suitability determination but prior to beginning work under the contract.&nbsp; In order for SSA to continue the background investigation process and enroll the contractor employee in the PIV credentialing process, at least one of the forms of identification must be a Government-issued photo ID (please see Employment Eligibility Verification, I-9, for acceptable forms of ID).</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Final Suitability Determination<br />Final suitability determinations are made in approximately 45-90 business days after submittal of the completed forms to CPSPM.&nbsp; If CPSPM determines that any employee is unsuitable, the COTR, CO, and contractor will be notified and SSA will revoke the employee's physical and logical access.&nbsp; The contractor must confirm receipt of the revocation within one business day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract as a result of SSA making an unfavorable suitability determination on contractor employees.&nbsp; Additionally, if SSA determines that the number or percentage of unfavorable determinations make successful contract performance unlikely, SSA may terminate the contract for cause or default.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp; Exceptions<br />The COTR may request an exception to the normal background investigation process for emergency situations when access to a facility or site is needed, but where access to information systems or programmatic information is not required.&nbsp; This request must be directed to CPSPM.&nbsp; COTRs may request an exception by sending an email to dchr.ope.hspd12appeals@ssa.gov.&nbsp; If CPSPM grants temporary access, that temporary access will apply only for the period specified by CPSPM and only for the specific contract employee(s) identified by the COTR.&nbsp; CPSPM expects that it will rarely grant exceptions.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp; Contractor Notification to Government<br />The contractor shall notify the COTR (who will notify CPSPM and the CO) within one business day if an employee is arrested or charged with a crime during the term of this contract, or if there is any other change in the employee's status (e.g., the employee leaves the company; the employee no longer works under the contract; the employee's alien status changes) that could impact the suitability determination for that individual.&nbsp; The contractor must provide in that notification as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to:&nbsp; employee name(s), contract number, the type of charge(s), if applicable, the court date, and, if available, the disposition of the charge(s).</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; Government Control<br />The Government has full control over and may grant, deny, or withhold access to a facility, site, system, or information and may require the COTR and contractor to remove personnel from performing under the contract for reasons related to conduct even after the individual has been found suitable to work on the contract (see paragraph n., below).</p>
<p>m.&nbsp; Appeals Process for Unsuitable Determinations<br />The contractor must notify the employee of any unsuitable determinations as soon as possible after receipt of such a determination.&nbsp; If the employee would like clarification or wish to appeal an unsuitable determination, his/her request must be in writing and submitted within 30 days of the date of the unsuitable determination.&nbsp; The request can be emailed to SSA at<br />dchr.ope.hspd 12 appeals@ssa.gov, or mailed to:</p>

<p>n&nbsp; Removal From Duty</p>
<p>SSA may request that the contractor immediately remove any contractor employee(s) from working under the contract based on conduct that occurs after a pre-screening approval or favorable suitability determination.&nbsp; The contractor must comply with these requests.&nbsp; The Government's determination may be made based on, but not limited to, incidents involving the misconduct or delinquency as set forth below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Violation of the Rules and Regulations Governing Public Buildings and Grounds, 41 Code of Federal Regulations 101-20.3.&nbsp; This includes any local badging requirements.</p>

<DESC>The PEPFAR Country Coordinator is the primary point of contact and coordinator of activities related to the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the country. The PEPFAR Coordinator plays a critical role in the planning, implementation, and reporting of program performance of inter-agency programs. The role of the coordinator is becoming more essential as the size and complexity of the program grows.<br />The Ambassador heads the in-country PEPFAR program and is the final decision-maker under PEPFAR Guidance to all program plans and activities that are submitted to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator for approval.<br />The Coordinator is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a negotiator. The Coordinator is, in general, not a technical director, although the Coordinator may be expected on occasion to ensure follow-up on implementation of technical recommendations based on the Country Operational Plan (COP) and other performance review information. When delegated this authority by the Ambassador, the Coordinator may represent PEPFAR with external partners including government, press, and others. Agency leads may also be expected to play a role in public diplomacy based on authority delegated by the Ambassador.<br />Country teams should establish a management interagency working group comprising Agency leads (who may be heads of agencies or of technical offices depending on Agency preference). The relationship between the management working group, the Coordinator, and the Ambassador/DCM will vary according to country needs. While there may be some exceptions based on the determination of the Ambassador, the norm is that the Coordinator will be accountable to ensure this group is established, has an agenda, and is achieving objectives<br />The Coordinator is the lead for the COP, Semi-Annual Program Results (SAPR), and Annual Program Results (APR) development.<br />The Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that reports are submitted to Washington in time, for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-Agency work, and for keeping Agencies on task for inter-Agency efforts.<br />

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Governments evaluation of quotations will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under 52.212-2 (b) of 1.) Technical Capability, 2.) Price. The evaluation of these factors will utilize an award basis that results in an award to the lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA) quotation. Quotes that do not meet the stated minimum technical specifications, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award. Finally, quotations that are incomplete and/or are determined to be priced unreasonably too high or too low, may not be selected for award. Therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification standpoint. Under the LPTA source selection process, trade-offs are not permitted, proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-price factors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Technical: The government will evaluate technical proposals and the below listed sub-factors on a pass/fail-basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, or unacceptable. An unacceptable rating for any of the below sub-factors will result in an unacceptable rating for this Technical Capability primary factor. Accordingly, under the LPTA source selection approach, vendors who receive an unacceptable rating for this factor, will not be considered for award. Technical Acceptability shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>Technical ratings will be evaluated entailing a comparison of quoted specifications with relation to specifications of the government's requirements, and respective salient characteristics of each appliance type. If the associated specifications of any quoted item do not meet the Government's stated minimum specification, may result in a vendor's entire quotation being ineligible for award. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation, if the Government accepts any item, or group of items, of a quotation.</p>
<p>As a result of the government's evaluation of the aforementioned Technical Capability sub-factors of Transition Plans, Management Plans, Resources, and all associated elements accordingly, a determination of acceptable of unacceptable will be assigned using the following ratings and descriptions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Capability Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>ii. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness and affordability, an initial screening of quotations will be performed to compare pricing to both Government and commercial web-based databases, and with comparison to the Government's estimate, and in relation to the product quoted. Quotations that are determined to be priced unreasonably, as either too high or too low, may not be selected for award.</p>
<p>(c) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award. Of those vendors found technically acceptable award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined reasonable and affordable.</p>
<p>**Quoted pricing, with comparison to the Government's estimated budget, that is determined either too high or too low, may result in such quotation not being considered for award.**</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the quotation, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the vendor's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quotation), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.</p>
<p>A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
<p>If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) ( ) Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) CONCERNS.  Firms responding to this announcement must be registered and verified as a SDVOSB in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov by the response date of this announcement.   

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541310 and the applicable small business size standard is $4.5 million.  The area of consideration is RESTRICTED to within a 200 mile radius of the VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Biloxi Campus, 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, Mississippi.  The primary A/E firm's main office or an existing branch office must be located within the 200 mile radius.  The estimated construction range is $2,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. 

The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System is seeking Architect-Engineering (AE) design services to provide a full set of bid documents (Scope of Work, Drawings, Specifications, and Cost Estimate) for Project No. 520-12-101, Renovate N&FS to VCS Canteen Bldg. 21.

A/E SCOPE OF WORK
Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of  bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-builts drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-12-101.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  
All plans and elevation drawings shall be a minimum scale of 1/8"=1'0", large scale details (minimum "=1'0") at largest possible scale to convey conditions of the work to be encountered.  All site drawings shall be a minimum of 1"=30' scale.  Drawings shall be developed by AutoCad Software Release 2008 (or better) and shall be stored on compact disk (disk to be submitted with design submissions mentioned above.) All drawings are to remain the property of the VA.
This project consists of a complete renovation of  existing kitchen of Building 21.  Included will be  major and minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  

The existing infrastructure is over 80 years old and does not meet current VCS needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for a combination of retail space and dining areas.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to maintain a complete newly renovated modern facility.  In addition, we intend to modernize VCS by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas. 
The VCS design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the facility will be designed with vinyl, tile, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.
The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  
The project design shall be completed in accordance with this scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 
	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications

	H-08-4, VA Standard Details
	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations

I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.(3) ?Payment request? means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation entitled "Online Respirator Medical Questionnaire and Evaluation Clearance Tool" is amended as follows:
<p>The Time and Date for proposal submission has been extended to THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 2012 at NOON EST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Attached, is a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for a non-commercial item&nbsp;to provide The Department of Health and Human Services, Federal Occupational Health (FOH) with an Online Respirator Medical Questionnaire and&nbsp; Evaluation Clearance&nbsp;Tool.</p>
<p><br />According to the Department of Labor (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the primary means to control occupational diseases caused by breathing contaminated air is through the use of feasible engineering controls, such as enclosures, confinement of operations, ventilation, or substitution of less toxic materials. When effective engineering controls are not feasible, or while they are being instituted, appropriate respirators shall be used pursuant to OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134(c)(1)(ii). With the threat of Pandemic Influenza ever present, it is necessary to implement a Mandatory Respirator Protection Program for many Federal agencies. In accordance with the OSHA's Respiratory Protection Standard, cited above, Federal agencies must comply with this requirement to medically evaluate employees before they use a respirator to ensure that they are physically capable of using a respirator without adverse medical effects.</p>

<p>FAR 52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (Apr 2010)<br />(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or</p>
<p>(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.</p>
<p>(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.</p>
<p>(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.</p>
<p>(d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7).<br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The AFNWC/PKOD is soliciting a Competitive 8(a) Set-Aside, Firm Fixed Price Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 377 MSG/CE mission at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Competition will be restricted to companies with a bona fide place of business in the State of New Mexico, SBA's Acceptance Letter #0682/12/201593/01. A determination/approval of a bona fide place of business must be acquired through the Small Business Administration. Current A&amp;E contractors on contract at Kirtland AFB are not permitted to participate. Foreign contractors will not be permitted to participate at the prime contractor level. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Maintenance Contract. Individual Task Order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task Order limits will be $2,000 to $3,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $64M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at Kirtland AFB, NM. Offers are solicited only from business concerns current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)<br />Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP) utilizes best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 215.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3 and MP 5315.3, targeted toward a Competitive 8(a) set-a-side with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to 8(a) small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet the requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project consists of a facility expansion, LRPD Advanced HPM Research Facility Expansion (Project # MHMV 110112). The seed project magnitude is between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors:</p>
<p>1) Technical/Technical Risk<br />2) Past Performance<br />3) Cost/Price</p>
<p>Within the Technical/Technical Risk Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Organizational Structure and Staffing <br />b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project<br />c) Change and Cost Control Management<br />d) Quality Control Program</p>
<p>The Technical/Technical Risk and Past Performance factors will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation, are considered equal in importance, and, when combined, are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness. The sub-factors within the Technical/Technical Risk Factor are considered equal in importance.</p>
<p>The price for the Seed Project will be evaluated IAW DFARS 252.236-7007. The priorities in the price schedule (RFP Attachment 32) apply and are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Additive Bid Item #1 - Crane<br />2. Additive Bid Item #2 - Future Power</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive a basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project, which satisfies the contract minimum requirement. All remaining awardees will be awarded an initial $2,000 Task Order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement. All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees.</p>
<p>The solicitation is available in electronic format only. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if there are additional sources capable of providing the required supplies and ancillary services. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only. No solicitation is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. The Government, through the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Directorate at the Air Force Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC/GP), is conducting market research to assist in determining the ability of industry to produce the Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) system.
<p>Description of Desired Capabilities: The Government contemplates awarding a follow-on sole source contract Raytheon Systems Limited, United Kingdom, to perform the following production, integration and test effort: (1) hardware procurement of ADAP Antenna Electronics; (2) hardware procurement of Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas; (3) hardware procurement of Ground Plan Enclosures; (4) Assembly, Integration and Test of Ground Plane Assemblies (with/without Fiber Optic Antenna Links); (5) repair of Antenna Electronics, Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas, and Ground Plane Assemblies; (6) Quick Reaction Support; (7) Technical Services; (8) transition to organic hardware support, including necessary rights in data; (9) transition to organic software support, including necessary rights in data. Antenna Electronics must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-ADAP-AE-401, Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-ADAP-CRPA-402, and Ground Plane Assembly (with/without Fiber Optic Antenna Link) must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-ADAP-GPA-403.</p>
<p>The Government does not own the "Production Build" drawing/specifications for the ADAP Antenna Electronics or Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna and there are no R&amp;D dollars available for this follow-on contract. Any changes to the existing specifications would result in a loss of interoperability with existing platform integrations and substantial costs associated with fielding multiple antenna systems (integration, training, spares, sustainment, etc.). The anticipated period of performance of the new contract is January 2013 to 30 Sep 2017. It is also anticipated that program responsibility will be transferred to Warner Robins Air Logistics Center by or shortly after award of the new contract.</p>
<p>To accomplish program objectives, Respondents must be fully familiar with the ADAP design and interface requirements and able to begin production work upon award. The Respondent must operate facilities at and employ personnel cleared at the SECRET level and must comply with security requirements found in the GPS Security Classification Guide.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions: Information regarding capability must be submitted in writing. Proprietary information should be marked accordingly. Statements of Capability must be received by&nbsp;<strong>5 April 2012</strong> , 1200 hours, Pacific Standard Time. Submissions shall be unclassified and addressed to the contracting office personnel stated below. Responses shall be sent via e-mail and must be in electronic format (MS Word 2003 or newer, or PDF), and must conform to 8.5" x 11" page size, one-inch margins, type 12 font. Submittals must not exceed 10 pages, single-sided, in length. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>The capability statement must provide the following information as a part of its cover sheet:<br />(1) Company name and address;<br />(2) Identify your organization's business type inclusive of any and all socio-economic status (e.g., 8(a) certified program participant, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran owned, HUB Zone or women-owned);<br />(3) Point of Contact,<br />(4) Phone/fax/e-mail;<br />(5) NAICS code(s); and,<br />(6) Information regarding your organization's capabilities.<br />Statements of capability shall include information relevant and specific to demonstrating the ability to meet ADAP production, integration, and test requirements described above, in additional to the following areas:<br />(1) Experience: A brief description of previous similar projects and experience demonstrating a high level of competence in required capabilities described above, including experience with antenna systems or similar technologies;<br />(2) Any other information that would demonstrate the ability to perform the required effort.<br />Respondents must demonstrate the ability to accomplish this effort, including experience relevant to the required capabilities and tasks described above. Respondents should clearly demonstrate the capability to perform production, integration, and test effort described. Documentation may include, but not be limited to, government and commercial contracts that the company performed (include government points of contact both technical and contractual), references, i.e. names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organization's capability, e.g., awards, commendations, etc.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential Respondents. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from Respondents when they prefer not to use established channels to communicate their concerns during any phase of the acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain Respondent issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this proposed acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the Program Director or the Contracting Officer but to advocate a Respondent concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the Respondent. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of SOCs for this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr Jim Gill, (310) 653-1789. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the POCs listed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334220, with a size standard of 750 employees.</p>

<DESC>-----<br><br>22 March 2012: Registration for the NGDS Industry Day is now available at http://www3.natick.army.mil/NGDS.html<br><br>-----<br><br>Purpose<br>The purpose of the Next Generation Diagnostics System (NGDS) solicitation is to:<br>* Award multiple contracts to vendors of commercially available FDA-cleared diagnostic platforms for initial competitive prototyping; <br>* Develop and manufacture FDA-cleared in-vitro diagnostic and environmental surveillance assays for biological warfare agents (BWA), infectious diseases, and other pathogens of operational concern; <br>* Integrate the platform to be interoperable with DoD CBRN and medical information systems.<br><br>Background<br><br>The NGDS Increment 1 system proposed is an FDA-cleared, reusable, adaptable diagnostic device for the analysis of biological (clinical) liquid samples. Increment 1 medical diagnostic capabilities will provide health care providers with timely and accurate information to guide individual patient treatment. Additionally, the BW threat identification information obtained during diagnostic testing will provide battle field commanders with biological hazard situational awareness to support Force Protection and Force Health Protection decision making. The NGDS Increment 1 is intended to eventually replace the current Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS).<br><br>The proponent for this effort is the Chemical Biological Medical Systems - Biosurveillance (CBMS-BSV) Joint Product Management Office of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD).<br><br>Industry Day Information<br><br>CBMS-BSV will conduct an NGDS Industry Day at 12:30 p.m. on 3 April 2012 and from 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. of 4 April 2012 in Room L-6 at the Cook Convention Center in Memphis, TN to discuss the NGDS draft RFP.

<DESC>This is to provide answers to vendors' questions:<br><br>1.	Is there currently an incumbent performing this effort?  If so, is the incumbent eligible to compete as a small business?<br><br>Government answer:  Yes.  CACI Enterprise Solutions, Inc. is the incumbent under W91QV1-10-C-0077.  CACI is a large business.<br><br>2.	Will users outside of the SPS-Army Enclave be permitted to call the SPS-A Help Desk?<br><br>Government answer:  See RFP Amendment 4 for update.<br><br>3.  The SPS-A help desk will be contacted only by the users that have a database in the enclave.  They also will utilize the JPMO and ART help desk procedures as outlined within the PWS for Functional support. The SPS-A help desk will be contacted for technical issues such as but not limited to server's not running, Citrix issues and interface problems.  See RFP Amendment 4 for update.<br><br>4.	How will the End of Fiscal Year User Support Center (OFYUSC) staff access the Army Siebel SRs handled by the JPMO SPS Help Desk?<br><br>Government answer:  The EOFYUSC staff will not have access to Army Siebel SRs. See RFP Amendment for update. <br><br>5.	How many FTEs will compose the team?  Please clarify the hours of support for the SPS-A System Administration Team and the Support Team (ART). <br><br>Government answer:  The RFP provides the estimated number of Full-Time-Equivalents (FTEs) for the PWS requirements.<br><br>6.	In section 3.3.4, Portal Management (page 67 of 88), it states that the deliverable "Portal Implementation should be completed 90 days after government decision".  Yet, in Section 5, deliverable Schedule, it states "within 90 days of contract award". Please confirm that the Portal Implementation is 90 after government decision/approval.<br><br>Government answer:  See RFP Amendment for update.<br><br>7.	According to the pre-solicitation notice, we saw that the Period of Performance currently states in Section 4: "The contract Period of Performance (PoP) runs 18 months, from April 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013, including base and option period, subject to the Government's option to extend the term of the contract. There will be two-week transition period commencing March 15, 2012."  Please confirm dates.<br><br>Government answer:  The period of performance for the Base and Option periods, as follows:  Base:  May 30, 2012 to September 30, 2012 (4 months); Option:  October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013 (12 months), subject to the Government's Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  There will be two-week transition period commencing May 30, 2012 to June 11, 2012.  See RFP Amendment for update.<br><br>8.	Paragraph 3.3.3 of the Performance Work Statement specifies support for the SPS-Army Enclaves, but it is not clear if this includes ALTESS, Europe and Redstone.  Currently, CACI provides support only for ALTESS. It is not clear if paragraph 3.3 of the Performance Work Statement includes support for Army sites outside of the SPS-Army Enclave; this is work that CACI is currently performing.  <br><br>Government Answer: The production SPS-Army Enclave is located in Radford, VA at the US Army Acquisition, Logistics & Technology Enterprise Systems & Services (ALTESS) with a COOP site located in Huntsville, AL at Redstone. The contractor will be required to perform the SPS-Army Enclave Support task listed in the PWS at both locations. Paragraph 3.3 includes functional and technical support to all the U.S. Army's SPS operational user community worldwide.  See RFP Amendment for update.<br><br>9.	Do we need security/facility clearance before bid on this contract and what would be evaluation criteria?<br><br>Government answer:  No.  A security/facility clearance is not required.<br><br>10.	PowerBuilder is listed as a technology - Is there a requirement for software development/enhancements to the product suite?<br><br>Government Answer: No.  There is not a requirement for software development/enhancements to the PD2 product suite.<br><br>11.	Is there a specific Contract Vehicle that this will be awarded under?<br><br>Government answer:  A new Contract will be awarded.<br><br>12.	What type of contract will this be - FFP, T&M, FFP-LOE?<br><br>Government answer:  Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type.<br><br>13.

See RFP Amendment for updates.<br><br>15.	Technical instructions state the volume is limited to 50 pages.  Does that include past performances? <br><br>Government answer:  Past Performance Questionnaires are excluded from the 50-page limit.  See RFP Amendment for update.<br><br>16.	Please clarify and confirm if March 30, 2012 is the actual submission date.<br><br>Government answer:  The due date and time for proposals is NLT 12:00 p.m. on March 30, 2012.  <br><br>RFP Amendment 4 will be posted March 22, 2012 on FBO.<br><br>Nothing follows.<br>

<DESC>Request for Information: Consumer Credit Information Panel<br /><br />Background: Consumer Credit Information Panel for Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Research<br /><br />The CFPB seeks to acquire and maintain a nationally representative panel of credit information on consumers for use in a wide range of policy research projects. <br /><br />The panel would be a random sample of consumer credit files obtained from a national database of credit files. The outside contractor would provide an initial panel of consumers with information on an annual or quarterly basis for each of the last 10 years. Going forward, the contractor would provide updated consumer credit files for the consumers in the database on an annual or quarterly basis.<br /><br />The CFPB seeks to obtain information that will enable it to identify the important design considerations in developing such a panel. The CFPB requests comments on the following issues.<br /><br />Study population:<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB may consider the household as the appropriate sampling unit for the panel. How would your organization construct a panel based on households? <br /><br />&bull; Can your organization identify joint borrowers, co-signers, and/or authorized users? How? Should the Bureau append to the core sample of consumers or households joint borrowers, co-signers, and/or authorize users? What are the trade-offs the Bureau should consider in making this determination?<br /><br />&bull; The panel will have ongoing annual or quarterly refreshes. What are the benefits of moving from an annual to a quarterly update schedule? Additionally, does your organization have the ability to provide data for interim periods? For example, if you provide quarterly updates, can you provide monthly data on credit balances? For example, for an end-of-calendar Q1 data pull, would you be able to tell us the credit balances for consumers in January and February?<br /><br />&bull; One issue of concern is how the CFPB should treat files that are split. A file might be split if new tradelines reveal that a consumer identified as a single individual is actually two people. Similarly, a file might be split because some tradelines are identified as fraudulent. How would your organization handle credit files that are split between sample pulls? How would you suggest treating these files to maintain the representativeness of the panel? Can your technology identify these split files?<br /><br />&bull; A similar concern is how the CFPB should treat files that get combined. For example, two files might be combined if new tradelines reveal that two files actually belong to a single consumer. How would your organization handle credit files that are combined between sample pulls? How would you suggest treating these files to maintain the representativeness of the panel? Can your technology follow two files that are combined into a single file?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB would like to do an initial data pull that goes back 10 years. For each of the years in this initial pull, the sample needs to be representative of the population of credit files at that time. Given this objective, what methodology is recommended to establish the initial sample? If an initial pull is for 10 years, should the base population be selected at a current date, should it be selected at the beginning of the 10 year data pull, or should the CFPB consider an alternate method?<br /><br />&bull; An important consideration in designing the panel is to maintain its representativeness over time. Describe the methods your organization could provide to assure the ongoing representativeness of the panel. Would your organization compare updated samples with a representative sample of the current credit population?<br /><br />&bull; How would your organization plan to identify new entrants to update the panel over time? In your answer, could you specifically address the challenge of differentiating between truly new entrants and files that look like new entrants, but are really not (e.g., files that are split over time).<br /><br />&bull; If the CFPB pulls a sample today, and then tries the pull the updated records of the same sample a year from now, should the CFPB assume that some files won't be found? Could you list the specific reasons why your organization might not be able to find all the records?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB seeks input on the recommended size of the panel. The CFPB is estimating a panel of roughly 1 million consumers. The Bureau intends to study the behavior of individuals and financial products over time on a national and regional basis. Do the consumer panels deployed by other Federal agencies and private sector entities offer a meaningful comparative metric?<br /><br />&bull; Please provide any additional recommendations for constructing an initial credit panel.<br /><br />Data Characteristics:<br /><br />&bull; Central to the creation of the panel is the ability to track consumers over time. Please describe how your organization follows consumers over time. If individuals are tracked by means of a unique identifier, under what condition can this identifier change? If two credit records are combined, which identifier (if either) is maintained? Similarly, if a credit record splits into multiple records, how are the identifiers for the new records assigned?<br /><br />&bull; The consumer panel would include available information in the consumer's credit file. To maintain consumer privacy, what data fields would have to be anonymized? Please identify the specific data fields that could be made available for analysis.<br /><br />&bull; Are there additional variables associated with the consumer credit file that are not part of a consumer report, but would be available for research (e.g. identity theft flag)? Please identify other raw data fields that the CFPB could consider obtaining as part of the panel.<br /><br />Panel Features: <br /><br />&bull; The CFPB would like to use the consumer credit panel to analyze and survey subpopulations of individual consumers on their use of specific types of products (e.g. private label cards; general purpose branded cards) and product subclasses (e.g., first time home equity loans). How would you recommend developing the panel to permit such surveys? How would you implement such a survey consistent with Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) obligations?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB is interested in tracking the tradelines of particular consumers over time.<br /><br />o What techniques/technologies are available to enable such tracking?<br />o Can such technologies track accounts after they have been sold (e.g. to a debt buyer) or transferred? If so, how?<br />o Some loans may be reported by multiple reporting entities. These potentially could appear as duplicates on a person's credit record. How would your organization recommend identifying duplicates?<br /><br />&bull; Please describe the categories of consumer non-credit attributes (include specific examples as well) that your organization could attach to the panel.<br /><br />&bull; Can your organization provide a credit score for each consumer in the panel? What specific scores would be available and over what time frame?<br /><br />&bull; What restrictions, if any, exist on the supplying the name of furnishers of specific tradelines? If the identity of a furnisher cannot be provided, is it possible to provide an anonymized indicator that would allow the CFPB to identify trade lines across consumers that are from the same furnisher? What information is available to describe the type of data furnisher?<br /><br />&bull; What information is available to describe the type of tradeline (e.g. industry type, loan type, interest rate, etc.)?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB plans to supplement this file periodically with additional data sources in accordance with FCRA requirements. These data linkages likely would be conducted by the outside contractor or a third party. Please describe the necessary technical specifications to permit the future linking of this panel with other databases. Does your organization have such a capability?<br /><br />&bull; For any of the strategies recommended in your response, what limitations apply when applying these strategies to the initial 10 year data pull? To historical data in general?<br /><br />Other issues:<br /><br />&bull; Prior Performance: Please provide any example of comparable panels developed by your organization for other institutions.<br /><br />&bull; What type of external resources (e.g. consulting) should the Bureau plan for as it sets up and maintains this consumer panel?<br /><br />For all of the bullet points addressed, please specify whether your particular firm is describing a capability that has already been implemented or whether it is describing one that could be implemented. Please also describe: (a) the standard list price for any data set or service described, if there is a standard commercial list price available, (b) known limitations of the service discussed, (c) whether capabilities are internal or external, (d) and a description of the level of staffing required to implement the activity or service described, <br /><br />In addition to the above, the response should include all of the following:<br /><br />1. Vendor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address;<br />2. Vendor's business size status, including any applicable socio-economic classifications (e.g. HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.), and its most applicable North American Industry Code System (NAICS) code. <br />3. Whether the vendor has the capability to perform the contemplated work as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, or anticipates significant teaming arrangements; <br />4. Recommendations for how to structure a program to project and measure the costs of building and maintaining a national panel of consumer reporting information.<br /><br />Interested vendors&nbsp;shall respond no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, April 4, 2012. Responses shall&nbsp;sent via e-mail to <a href="mailto:psb3@bpd.treas.gov">psb3@bpd.treas.gov</a>. &nbsp;Subject heading shall&nbsp;state, "Attention: J. Oberlin, Consumer Credit Information Panel".&nbsp; All information in response to this notice must be sent via e-mail in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) or MSWord format. <br /><br />Note that this is not a request for proposal or quote and does not imply an obligation on the part of the Bureau to purchase services or to proceed to any request for proposals or quotes for such services. Any information provided to the Bureau in response to this Request will become the property of the Bureau and, in addition, may be subject disclosure under a FOIA request.

<DESC>**THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA) WILL TAKE ANY PROCUREMENT ACTION PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER. RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT**<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather pricing information for Vendor Managed Inventory of the FEMA Infant &amp; Toddler Shelter Kit. FEMA is requesting estimated pricing information for a vendor to manage ten (10) Infant and Toddler (I/T) kits. These kits, which include 26 line items, should be readily available to ship to any location in the continental United States or US territories within a 48 hour time frame. (Please see attached kit list) Each kit should be packaged in a tri-wall container with the perishable and non-perishable items segregated. A comprehensive spreadsheet listing all items of the kits to include manufacturer, lot number, and expiration date, will be attached to the exterior of the kits, as well as inside the kit. A copy of the spreadsheet should also be sent to the Contacting Officer's Representative (COR). Separate life-cycle information is required for perishable line items in each kit.
<p>There are nine (9) items that FEMA is requesting a 12 month shelf life from date of award. Those items are I/T #1-7, 16-17, &amp; 23, shown on the attachment. FEMA is willing to accept no less than a nine (9) month shelf life of these perishable items. However, any kits shipped with items that have less than a 12 month shelf life will require a one (1) time refresh of the kits. This shall be completed by the vendor if the kits are stored in a FEMA Distribution Center, via shipping destination or retrograde from disaster site. The refresh will achieve a 12 month shelf life from the original date of award for all perishable items contained in the kit.</p>
<p>Estimated pricing should be per kit to include CONUS transportation and any anticipated re-fresh/life cycle costs.<br /><br />ALL QUESTIONS AND/OR RESPONSES SHOULD BE E-MAILED TO <a href="mailto:AMANDA.ROGERS@FEMA.DHS">AMANDA.ROGERS@FEMA.DHS</a>. GOV.</p>

<SUBJECT>Addition of Attachment 4 to Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
<SOLNBR>HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<CONTACT>Kristina L. Parmenter, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-4679, Email kristina.parmenter@mda.mil - Janice S Olson, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-450-4330, Email janice.olson@mda.mil
<DESC><p>Amendment 03 adds Attachment 4 to the ATI BAA requesting supplemental information in Technology Area 2: Lasers and Electro-optical Systems.</p>
<p>Amendment 02 posted on 28 February 2012 served as the annual posting of this Broad Agency Announcement in accordance with FAR 35.016 (c).</p>
<p>Amendment 01 posted on 15 August 2011 updated contact information for the Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>Introduction:<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack. The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase. MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries. MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.</p>
<p>Technical advancement is essential for continuous improvement in the BMDS. MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term. The MDA Director, Advanced Technology (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.</p>
<p>MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Program to identify and develop innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS. ATI is a competitive, science and technology research program, which consists of forefront advanced research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).</p>
<p>The MDA contracts with private industry, qualified accredited domestic educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations for research in those areas covered in this BAA. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract, though the government reserves the right to use other types of contractual instruments if they are deemed more appropriate for the proposed work. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards, however, if MDA decides to pursue a concept the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle. Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz, MDA/DVR; 256-450-4366, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a concept paper or proposal in response to this BAA. Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) type contracts are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts. Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2012 through FY 2013.</p>
<p>Research Topics:<br />MDA/DV is interested in development of advanced technology research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment. The following nine ATI research topic areas pertain to the BMDS in all phases of the missile defense threat scenario:</p>
<p>(1) Radar Systems</p>
<p>(2) Lasers and Electro-optical Systems: Reference Attachment 4 for supplemental information in this area.</p>
<p>(3) Sensor Systems</p>
<p>(4) Computer, Signal and Data Processing</p>
<p>(5) Materials and Electronics</p>
<p>(6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</p>
<p>(7) Battle Management/Command and Control</p>
<p>(8) Propulsion and Power Systems</p>
<p>(9) Modeling and Simulation</p>
<p>(10) International BMDS Cooperation: Proposals for International BMDS Cooperation (area 10) must contain direct work relating to a foreign company or university that is either a partner or major subcontract under the proposed effort. This is the only area that we will entertain accepting basic or applied research proposals.</p>
<p>Note: The Government reserves the right to release additional or supplemental requests for information on any of the above listed topics through FedBizOps to evaluate and consider along with white paper submissions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following:</p>
<p>(1) A summary concept white paper (no more than ten pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program using the attached Proposal Instructions (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(2) White Paper Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM), using the attached Cost Proposal Instructions paragraph (5).</p>
<p>(3) A suggested program plan using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4)(d).</p>
<p>(4) A description of the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4)(e).</p>
<p>Note: Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. If selected for award MDA will request a full technical volume and detailed cost proposal as requested in the attached proposal instructions paragraphs (6) (7) and (8). DO NOT SUBMIT THE TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offeror's acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e). The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows:</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS: <br />MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation:</p>
<p>(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness;</p>
<p>(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives;</p>
<p>(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel which are critical in achieving the proposal objectives;</p>
<p>(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; and</p>
<p>(5) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offeror's proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: <br />The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror's proposal:</p>
<p>(1) The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application;</p>
<p>(2) The offerors' capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities;</p>
<p>(3) The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; and</p>
<p>(4) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. White papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive. This BAA will remain open until March 1, 2013. Submittals will continue to be accepted after initial posting date throughout the entire period of time the BAA is open.</p>
<p>Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).</p>

The IEWS Branch mission is to execute a multifaceted simulation program to advance U.S. Navy EW RDT&amp;E. Under Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) sponsorship, the Branch provides for the research, development, operation and maintenance of radio frequency (RF) anti-ship missile simulators, a large hardware-in-the-loop simulation facility (the Central Target Simulator) and specially-configured flying EW laboratories (currently hosted on NP-3D and Learjet platforms). In cooperation with the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Branch also maintains significant expertise to review threat capabilities and identify potential design weaknesses. The Branch simulation assets directly support the effectiveness evaluation of current and future EW systems and techniques in the RF domain.</span></p>

The CTS is a closed-loop simulation facility that is used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures in defeating RF-guided anti-ship missiles. The Facility is built around a 114-ft &times; 127-ft &times; 38-ft high shielded anechoic chamber. A spherical array of 225 dual-polarized antennas is used to simulate (and radiate) the RF environment that the missile encounters in an engagement. Two independent feed networks distribute time and space coincident signals. Simulator hardware is mounted 75 feet from the array on a three-axis flight motion simulator. The RF generation subsystem is synchronized to the simulator radar in time and frequency. State-of-the-art modulation equipment replicates the characteristics of ship and decoy echoes, correctly triggering target discriminates. External RF inputs allow jamming signals to be included in the simulation. The loop between the simulator and the facility is closed through a dual Xeon computer. This computer is programmed with a 6-degree of freedom aerodynamics/autopilot model that interacts with the guidance hardware in response to the RF stimuli. Simulations run in real time at update rates of up to 1000 Hz.</span></p>

<DESC>***This RFI was posted on March 13th, but was miscoded under the classification code "10-Weapons" rather than 69-Training Aids and Devices. No information has changed from the March 13th version and is simply being reposted to ensure maximum exposure to the training community***<br><br>Notice Type: Request For Information<br><br>Title: Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal III (SOF RAPTOR III)<br><br>Purpose: The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information and solicit industry comment prior to issuing a competitive solicitation for the SOF RAPTOR III effort. <br><br>Brief Summary: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Training Systems (PM STS) is looking to get information and feedback from interested sources for a new contract which would replace and expand the existing Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal II (SOF RAPTOR II) contract. SOF RAPTOR II supports numerous efforts in support of the objectives of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and its component commands: United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The new SOF RAPTOR III procurement is intended to support not only the objectives of USSOCOM programs, but to support the objectives of the joint SOF community that USSOCOM interfaces with to conduct operations. <br><br>Program Description: PM STS requires a contract vehicle to replace the existing SOF RAPTOR II contract which is close to reaching its ceiling. The SOF RAPTOR II contract, awarded in April 2009 with a ceiling of $48.9M, is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle, which replaced the SOF RAPTOR I contract. The SOF RAPTOR I contract was comprised of efforts that were 100% Engineering Services, whereas the SOF RAPTOR II contract was a mix of Engineering Services and Program Management efforts. Both contracts were awarded to small businesses. <br><br>SOF RAPTOR II provides the means for conducting live, virtual and constructive training, services, training requirements analysis, concept exploration, prototyping, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, and operation and maintenance functions to support USSOCOM and its component command training, simulator and simulation requirements. <br><br>It is expected that SOF RAPTOR III will continue to evolve in the future and is geared towards overall engineering services management rather than engineering services alone.<br><br>SOF RAPTOR III will provide a vehicle that incorporates the scope of the SOF RAPTOR II contract and will be expanded to include additional scope and tasks that will support all elements of mission preparedness and mission training. Mission preparedness, rehearsal, and training include primarily SOF tasks and include the joint community that USSOCOM operates and interfaces with such as the NATO Special Forces partners and other Government agencies. <br><br>Acquisition Strategy: It is the Government's intent that the SOF RAPTOR III program will be executed as a Small Business Set-Aside competition to result in a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ID/IQ contract. The estimated ceiling of this ID/IQ is $97.8M.<br><br>Request For Information: Interested parties are requested to review the draft Statement of Work and provide your written responses by 12:00 PM EST on March 30, 2012. The Government is requesting specific responses to the information provided below:<br><br>Administrative:<br>a. Provide company name, points of contact with phone number, and e-mail. <br>b. Every page should have the company name, header, page numbers, date and if applicable the version number.<br>Technical:<br>a. Program Management: It is expected that the new SOF RAPTOR III effort will not have funding to cover overarching Program Management functions, outside of individual Task Orders. <br>i. Describe your approach to be able to support Task Orders, sometimes with loosely defined requirements, as they arise. This includes the ability to provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) on cost, schedule, and performance with expedient turnaround times.<br>ii. Describe your ability to operate in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment with the Government and/or its customer, and how your program management is structured to meet very short timelines to make decisions, meet documentation and programmatic suspenses, etc.<br>iii. Describe your approach to managing the overall contract, subcontracts, and individual task orders. Differentiate your approach between a Task Order that is complex and program management intensive versus an order that would be a Commercial Off The Shelf procurement. <br>b. There could be instances where a significant surge of program management efforts (proposal preparation, IPT coordination, etc) is required. These surges could be random and without notice, yet require a quick turnaround (i.e. 4th quarter of the fiscal year). Identify your process for staffing and processing multiple proposals, while still managing current efforts. Describe your ability to surge to meet demands. <br>c. A summary of SOF RAPTOR II Delivery Orders is provided only as a reference of the type and variation of orders that were previously executed. Although potentially representative, there is no guarantee or assurance that these efforts will actually be a part of SOF RAPTOR III.<br><br>Vendors interested in this opportunity are requested to email their response no later than 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 30, 2012 to both the Contract Specialist Mr. Brian Serra (brian.serra@us.army.mil) and the Project Director, Mr. Norbert Granchi (norbert.granchi@us.army.mil). Contractors are requested to provide a white paper not exceeding ten (10) pages, including the cover sheet.

 This project will demolish the necessary existing walls, electric, lighting, ceiling, floor tile, asbestos mastic and pipe insulation abatement, mechanical equipment, ductwork, and plumbing for approximately 7600 gsf of existing ward space and will redesign a new state of the art ICU which will produce a 15 bed unit with private patient rooms and private baths.  The new ICU will contain all required medical gas, nurse call, and necessary appurtenances for an inpatient ICU care area.

The intent is for the design to occur during FY2012 with construction in FY2013.

Special consideration in the evaluation and selection process will be given to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Final ranking of interviewed firms will be based on the team proposed for this project, previous VA experience of the team, and specific structural design experience with existing facilities.

The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the designs located within a 150 mile radius of the Syracuse VA Medical Center as indicated by a mapquest.com driving directions search from prime designer to 800 Irving Ave, Syracuse NY 13210. 

 Appropriate data for this project must be submitted to the Contracting Specialist on Standard Form 330 no later than April 23, 2012 by 2:30p.m.  EST.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command has awarded a Sole-Source delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-12-G-0002 to Rolls Royce, PLC, Bristol, England, to provide Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) for the Pegasus (AV-8) engine (F402-RR-408A/B) for the Joint Program Office (JPO), which consists of the United States Marine Corps (USMC), Spanish Navy and Italian Navy, pursuant to the authority provided under FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." <br />Rolls Royce is the original designer, developer and manufacturer of the F402 (AV-8B) series engine and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical expertise to continue to provide the required supplies and services. Rolls Royce is the only source with the technical data, facilities and capabilities required to provide the associated system and sustainment support for the F402 (AV-8B) series engine requirements. Rolls-Royce maintains configuration control over the F402 engine and will not provide unlimited rights to the Government. No other manufacturer could design, develop and properly integrate F402 engine upgrades to meet the contract delivery schedules required to resolve issues in the fleet with the current configuration. Rolls Royce was selected as the prime contractor for the original engine development resulting from full and open competition. The Government does not possess a complete Technical Data Package and the rights necessary to conduct a competition and Rolls Royce is not willing to sell the rights to the Government.
<p>Under the proposed order, Rolls Royce shall perform logistic support activities to sustain the operational readiness requirements of the Pegasus engine. The period of performance shall be 01 March 2012 through 31 December 2012.</p>

, Minnetonka, MN 55343 US
<DESC>UnitedHealth Military &amp; Veterans Services, Minnetonka, MN, was awarded a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to provide managed care support to the Department of Defense TRICARE program.&nbsp; The West Region contractor will assist the Military Health System in operating an integrated health care delivery system combining the resources of the contractor and the military's direct medical care system to provide healthcare, plus medical and administrative support services to eligible beneficiaries in the West Region. The West Region includes the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa (except the Rock Island Arsenal area), Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri (except the St. Louis area), Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas (areas of Western Texas only), Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The work to be performed includes management of provider networks and referrals, medical management, enrollment, claims processing, customer service and access to data, among other requirements, while providing beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible through the delivery of world-class health care. This contract was competitively procured using the Best Value Tradeoff Source Selection process with two initial offers received. The TRICARE Management Activity, Aurora, Colorado is the contracting activity (HT9402-12-C-0001).
<p>The total potential contract value, including the approximate 10-month base period and five (5) one-year option periods for health care delivery, plus a transition-out period, is estimated at $20,462,202,594.<br /><br />The competitive contract action contains multiple contract types, but predominately cost plus fixed fee.&nbsp; It is appropriate to utilize the cost reimbursement contract type due to the uncertainties involved in contract performance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accurancy to use any type of fixed price.</p>

<p>This action is to award a bridge contract for<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>an extension of the two Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Global Solutions (DGS) contracts and an increase to the combined ceiling that will expire on 31 March 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will be accomplished via modifications to the existing DGS contracts as extensions of two, 6-month option periods on each of the DGS contracts providing continuity of the existing Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts providing transmission, switched voice, data services and network management necessary to meet Department of Defense (DoD) requirements until the <span style="COLOR: black">competitive awards of and transition to replacement contract(s) is completed. The DGS contracts, DCA200-02-D-5000 and 5001 (1-year base period with eight 1-year options), were competitively awarded to APPTIS (Formerly SETA) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) respectively on </span>5 October 2001 with a combined Not-to-Exceed (NTE) ceiling of $3 Billion, which is shared between the two contracts as separate individual ceilings for each contract were not established.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ceiling was increased to $4.2 Billion on 23 April 2009 and further increased to $4.835 Billion on 21 March 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DGS acquisition was awarded from one solicitation, with one award based upon full and open competition, and one award being set aside for small business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">Continued support is essential as many programs depend on the DISN to meet mission needs, specifically DISN life-cycle activities, other DISA programs, Combatant Commands, Services, and Defense agencies (CC/S/A) and Coalition forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the DGS contracts will be modified to add two, 6-month option periods to the lifecycle POP, potentially extending the POP through 31 March 2013 for each of the DGS contracts, and the total combined ceiling will be changed from $4.835B to $5.356B, an increase of $521M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the optional extension periods and increase to the ceiling amount is to ensure continuous, uninterrupted services as the Government re-competes the associated efforts.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planned replacement contract(s) are the Global Information Grid (GIG) Services Management (GSM) Contracts. GSM will provide performance-based Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services to operate, sustain, defend, deploy and engineer the DISN and related converged ICT services for DoD and other activities involved in national security communications. There will be three separate strategies to satisfy this requirement:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">Based on the above, SAIC and APPTIS for their respective contracted services, are the only sources that can perform this effort without the unacceptable disruption in critical defense worldwide telecommunications support. This bridge and extension is necessary to allow for sufficient time for the follow-on GSM strategies identified in Section 2 to be executed and for adequate time to transition to the eventual awardee(s).</p>

<p>This action is to award a bridge contract for<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>an extension of the two Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Global Solutions (DGS) contracts and an increase to the combined ceiling that will expire on 31 March 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will be accomplished via modifications to the existing DGS contracts as extensions of two, 6-month option periods on each of the DGS contracts providing continuity of the existing Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts providing transmission, switched voice, data services and network management necessary to meet Department of Defense (DoD) requirements until the <span style="COLOR: black">competitive awards of and transition to replacement contract(s) is completed. The DGS contracts, DCA200-02-D-5000 and 5001 (1-year base period with eight 1-year options), were competitively awarded to APPTIS (Formerly SETA) and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) respectively on </span>5 October 2001 with a combined Not-to-Exceed (NTE) ceiling of $3 Billion, which is shared between the two contracts as separate individual ceilings for each contract were not established.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ceiling was increased to $4.2 Billion on 23 April 2009 and further increased to $4.835 Billion on 21 March 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DGS acquisition was awarded from one solicitation, with one award based upon full and open competition, and one award being set aside for small business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">Continued support is essential as many programs depend on the DISN to meet mission needs, specifically DISN life-cycle activities, other DISA programs, Combatant Commands, Services, and Defense agencies (CC/S/A) and Coalition forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the DGS contracts will be modified to add two, 6-month option periods to the lifecycle POP, potentially extending the POP through 31 March 2013 for each of the DGS contracts, and the total combined ceiling will be changed from $4.835B to $5.356B, an increase of $521M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the optional extension periods and increase to the ceiling amount is to ensure continuous, uninterrupted services as the Government re-competes the associated efforts.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planned replacement contract(s) are the Global Information Grid (GIG) Services Management (GSM) Contracts. GSM will provide performance-based Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services to operate, sustain, defend, deploy and engineer the DISN and related converged ICT services for DoD and other activities involved in national security communications.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 27.0pt">Based on the above, SAIC and APPTIS for their respective contracted services, are the only sources that can perform this effort without the unacceptable disruption in critical defense worldwide telecommunications support. This bridge and extension is necessary to allow for sufficient time for the follow-on GSM strategies identified in Section 2 to be executed and for adequate time to transition to the eventual awardee(s).</p>

In order for repairs to be made by an authorized dealer the SAGE-MAX panels would had to be sent back to Export, PA, or another dealer in another state outside the local area. This work is outside the scope of the existing operations and maintenance contract. The scope is for the repair of 2 SAGE panel controller boards serving the complex energy management system.
