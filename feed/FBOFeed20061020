<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to negotiate a contract with The University of South Florida to continue serving as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Youth Study (TEDDY), an ongoing epidemiological study involving international clinical centers which are subcontractors to the DCC. The goal of TEDDY is identification of infectious agents, dietary factors, or other environmental agents, including psychosocial factors which trigger type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in genetically susceptible individuals or which protect against the disease. Identification of such factors will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and result in new strategies to prevent, delay or reverse T1DM. Data collection is ongoing from cohorts of newborns from the general population and newborn first-degree relatives of probands with T1DM. Newborns are first identified to be at genetic risk for T1DM before being offered enrollment for long term follow-up. These cohorts are to be followed for 15 years for the appearance of various beta-cell autoantibodies and diabetes, with documentation of early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors. The TEDDY study will include 5,940 neonates recruited from the general population with a pre-determined type 1 diabetes risk of 3% and 1,152 neonates with first degree relatives who have type 1 diabetes and who have a pre-determined type 1 diabetes risk of 10%. Thus, the study will follow a total of 7,092 participants across multiple clinical centers worldwide (both in Europe and in North America). The participants will be followed with blood sampling every three months for islet autoantibody measurements until age 4 years and then every six months until the age of 15, for a total of 95,742 samples over the first 5 years of the study and a total of 269,496 over the entire study. 

The DCC provides biostatistical and operational expertise and advice to the clinical centers and the NIDDK and will include the following tasks: 1) Study-Wide Communications, Dissemination of Study Materials, and Related Activities; 2) Data Management and Records Maintenance; 3)Clinic and Central laboratories Monitoring; 4)Data Analyses; 5)Preparation of Study Report and Papers for Publication; 6)Implementation of Procedures to Evaluate Management, Methodology, and Cost-Effectiveness of Procedures Utilized by the DCC; and 7)Periodic Meetings. 

Ongoing TEDDY assessments include: HLA typing-the criteria for enrollment into the study, and analysis of autoantibodies- the primary endpoint of the study. In addition there are follow up visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48 months of age; with subsequent visits every six months and blood samples are taken at each visit. The parents collect monthly stool samples in early childhood. The parents also fill out questionnaires at regular intervals in connection with visits. TEDDY study personnel complete charts at each visit. The parents record events in the child?s TEDDY Book. Continued long-term follow-up of the currently active TEDDY participants will provide important scientific information on early childhood diet, reported and measured infections, vaccinations, and psychosocial stressors.

The University of South Florida has served as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for TEDDY since 2002.  All procedures necessary for data collection, editing, and processing; and for the maintenance of permanent study files and documentation related to the TEDDY database are implemented by the DCC staff as specified in the Internal Procedures Manual and in accordance with HIPAA regulations. The DCC professional and technical staff includes the principal investigator, epidemiologists, database manager, statisticians, programmers, technology and web support, research assistants, nutritionists and administrative specialists, and data entry clerks.

The DCC utilizes the computing infrastructure of the University of South Florida (USF). The DCC is connected redundantly to the USF Wide Area Network. This network provides a 1 GB connection to the Commercial Internet as well as a 155 MB connection to Internet 2. The internal layer three server network is purely switched and consists of high end Cisco and Foundry network equipment operating at 1GB/s. All server architecture is connected redundantly to the switch fabric in order to maintain high availability of the systems. The DCC computing facility is a self supporting, secure facility comprised of a highly redundant primary server room as well as a secondary Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity facility located at a geographically separate location. All core production systems including but not limited to web servers, database servers, e-mail systems and network architecture are implemented in threes two redundant systems at the primary data center and a third at the DR facility. The DCC has developed a web application for the TEDDY study which provides for data collection, specimen collection and tracking, subject management, accrual reports, data compliance reports, and TEDDY study staff and committee communications. This web application was developed in Microsoft .NET using C#.NET and ASP.NET. The architecture of the application is multi-tiered with separate layers for data access, business logic, and the graphical user interface. This application communicates with an Oracle database to store all of the TEDDY data. This infrastructure provides one of the most secure and stable platforms available in the industry. 

All the TEDDY study data is transmitted electronically. The DCC receives and processes data from forms completed by Study Coordinators for the participants during the TEDDY clinic visits, the diet records and forms from the nutritionists during TEDDY clinic visits, data from the autoantibody and HLA laboratories and the repositories.  The forms and data are sent electronically and transmitted via secure data streams using 128-bite encrypted traffic between the clinical centers, laboratories and the DCC. The web server and database used by the DCC are located behind dually redundant firewalls. The website and database themselves are password protected. Access to the application and data requires authentication of the logged-on user and access to data further depends on the users pre-assigned level of access.

The DCC has implemented an automated fax-in data collection system called Verity Teleforms. Study centers can download preformatted paper forms from the study websites as PDFs. The PDFs are then printed and data can be collected on the paper forms. The forms are then faxed into the DCC and the Teleforms system. This product permits the transfer of data from paper forms to databases and applies intelligent recognition to interpret written data on the form and direct them to the appropriate database.  Laboratory data files and other data files are either uploaded through the study website or are sent via ftp to the DCC. Laboratory processing is in place to automatically process the data as it is uploaded. In some cases the DCC may receive database exports from other institutions to analyze as well. 

The DCC web collaboration toolset provides a secure portal where Principal Investigators, Study Coordinators, and other study support staff may post and review documents, announcements, and link to the protocol manager application, training, and other collaboration tools provided by the DCC.

The DCC maintains three enterprise SAS servers for data analysis. The systems allow the DCC to dynamically allocate computing resources for analysis based on need. This structure permits reporting and analysis to be done in the most efficient manner possible. PC SAS is also used within the DCC for various less computing intensive applications. Additional SAS servers can rapidly be deployed based on demand. The DCC also maintains staff with enterprise data mining and artificial intelligence expertise to address analysis that requires these technologies.

The DCC has developed the Protocol Manager data collection and protocol management system that identifies and tracks all events specified in a research protocol. Events include: eligibility determination, registration, clinical activities and assessments (e.g., physical exam, medical history), laboratory testing or other investigative procedures, patient self-assessments, and structured patient interviews. A schedule of events specific to the protocol is created for each subject, and the status of each event is tracked for completion status. Additionally, this system can import laboratory and other data, and manage subject events that are dependent upon test results (e.g., laboratory tests that determine eligibility or establish sub-populations requiring additional follow-up). The protocol management system operates within a secure Web site, where study updates are posted periodically.  Research staff and investigators can access a secure area on the Web site to obtain data views specially designed to aide them in their roles and responsibilities on the study. Views can be limited by study site or role, protecting subject data. The system incorporates data standards such as SNOMED CT and RxNorm when they exist. 
This system also enables high data quality. The DCC helps with the design of the data collection forms (incorporating relevant data standards), and has incorporated checks to minimize transcription and omission errors. They develop regular Quality Assurance reports that assess data quality post-data entry. They have set up interactive data entry validation that enables the correction of data errors at the source of data collection, and limits the need for correcting data at the audit or analysis phases of a study. 

The DCC has set up the Lotus Sametime Web Conferencing System for use. The system is web based and provides application desktop sharing as well as desktop video and audio. The system is based on standard network protocols and used regularly as a collaboration tool to enhance phone conferences and also to provide a mechanism for interactive training at a distance.

The DCC has also set up a Media and Training Center on-line whereby study support staff can receive video and text based training on the suite of tools provided by the DCC as well as adverse events, data standards, and study specific training such as, but not limited to, how to accurately fill out a given form or interview with a subject. Training can be broadcast and recorded live at the DCCs training facility or can be recorded elsewhere and placed online by the DCC staff. The system provides a detailed tracking and reporting system so that study PIs and coordinators can track who has received training online. The system is capable of streaming a host of video and audio formats including, but not limited to: Microsoft Streaming Video, RealPlayer, Apple Quick Time, and MPEG.

The data collected on-line, whether by on-line entry or teleforms, goes into an Oracle database.  Several macros are then run through SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) to create Oracle tables that mimic the data forms collected. These tables, along with others created in Oracle, are then used by the statisticians and SAS programmers to extract data for analysis. Once an analysis is requested, by a clinical center, committee, investigator, etc., the statisticians use SAS to conduct the analysis. There are several different procedures used within SAS depending on the analysis requested (e.g. FREQ, UNIVARIATE, GLM, REPORT, PHREG, etc.). Once an analysis is completed it is sent to the requestor (and any other appropriate personnel) for review. Occasionally an analysis may also be done using SQL statements either in Oracle of SAS. These statements allow the creation of tables that can be analyzed as well. The reports/analyses are then posted to the TEDDY website under the appropriate area (General Reports, clinical center, committee, etc.). 

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) has a significant role in the operation of TEDDY. TEDDY is a complex project that requires extensive amounts of coordination of individuals and organizations that are nationally and internationally based. In addition to coordination of large meetings, the administrative staff is charged with report preparation and travel arrangements. As the accrual target for the study is 220,000 screened and 7,092 followed, the DCC will acquire extensive amounts of data for entry, analysis, reporting and publication. Database development and management is a critical function of the DCC as the volume of materials managed is so vast. Project staff for the Data Coordinating Center is divided into different areas: biostatisticians, epidemiologists, nutritionists, computer programmers, statistical programmers, database engineers and analysts, data managers. The DCC has to develop statistical designs for epidemiological studies, development and testing of predictive models for disease progression and provide direct logistical support for their implementation. The DCC is involved in overseeing subcontracting process for reference laboratories and sets policies and procedures for banking samples and data in accordance with the Institutes, Cosponsors and Steering Committee. The DCC has to review all manuscripts and abstracts. The biostatisticians have to address issues related to multiple end points (e.g., the occurrence of autoantibodies as well as diabetes), the evaluation of surrogate biomarker endpoints and multiple comparisons. The epidemiologists have to focus on several proposed studies involving both prospective and/or retrospective case-control designs, as well as genetic and gene-environment interactions and assess the prevalence and incidence of disease-related end point. The epidemiologists have to be involved with protocol development, preparation of request of proposals for reference labs and organize the manual of operations. They are responsible for organizing the process by which data is electronically transferred from reference laboratories. They have to FTP, import, and process data from remote laboratories. They are responsible for logging in receipt of data, checking files for reporting and/or transmission errors and reconcile with laboratories. The epidemiologists have to answer lab correspondence regarding problem samples, provide extensive phone contact with Clinical Centers (respond to inquiries regarding results, subject status reports, timing of tests/windows, and requests for materials, diagnosis determination, and other protocol related questions.). The epidemiologist has to assist with management reports, quality control reports and study documentation, prepare reports for project committees and proofread packets being sent to the clinical centers: including Specimen Transmittal Forms, Screening Forms, and various reports. The epidemiologists has to assist with preparation of material related to the Institutional Review Board, maintain the IRB approval files from all participating Clinical Centers and their affiliates as appropriate and perform as liaison between IRB and the Principal Investigators. The nutritionist has to coordinate collection dietary data from United States and international centers and advice and provide training, as well as perform quality control of the subject interviews and interact widely with the clinical centers and/or clinical investigators to see that protocol compliance meets research standards and remains high. The nutritionist has to develop instructions and advice materials for food portion size estimates as well as the adaptation of the questionnaires of the dietary forms for the different languages. The computer programmer has to work collaboratively with biostatisticians, scientific investigators, and data managers to design and manage research studies and has to be responsible for database design and development. The computer programmer is responsible for the development and implementation of systems for data entry and database driven webpage development The programmer has to provide the backend server support necessary to maintain the study domain and the system of password controls over data access and supervise the programming staff during the implementation of the TEDDY website, online data collection forms and security procedures. The computer programmer analyst has to maintain the Visual Basic/.Net front-end to the Consortium database including daily and weekly automated processes, end-user issues, data flow in and out of database, data integrity and quality control, and database development. The analyst has to maintain and update DCC main website as well as DCC's secure committee access sites as well as provide back-end support for a web-based system that allows institutions to request materials necessary for IRB approval and maintain the IRB database. The analyst has to maintain the TeleForms data-entry system for hard copy data entry and aid in the planning of the design of the Oracle backend database, implement the common framework used throughout the project. The statistical programmer has the responsibility for developing study management reports dealing with accrual, enrollment, and data quality which is an extensive undertaking. The statistical programmer has to develop reports for each TEDDY committee and for the External Advisory Committee and at the same time work on SAS tools to make the data more accessible to TEDDY investigators. The programmer has to deal with quality assurance and data completeness so that the study can monitor whether there is adequate follow-up, shipping is occurring in a timely fashion and whether the reference laboratories are performing as contracted. The database engineer is responsible for implementing the protocol. The engineer has to design data systems including data collection systems, databases, reports, maintenance systems, and access interfaces for users such as biostatisticians, investigators, and data managers. The engineer has to implement the database management systems, including Visual Basic, Oracle, automated forms technologies (Teleforms), data collection (entry), storage, reporting, and backup systems, user interfaces and access methods. The database programmer has to focus on the tabulation of data and the provision of online tools as well as develop and implement online data tools to assist investigators in access to the data and the formulation of data queries that can lead to insights into the developing data sets. The database programmer has to produce standard reports on protocol accrual, compliance and outcomes as well as facilitate the implementation of protocol data quality monitoring systems. The research associates are responsible for providing shipping supplies to all the clinical centers for items shipped to the Autoantibody Reference Labs, the HLA Reference Lab, and for all stool sample shipping.

Clinical Centers There are 6 clinical centers that are subcontracted to collect the subjects for the TEDDY study and are paid on per subject basis. They are as follows:
Pacific Northwest Research Institute
University of Colorado Health Science Center
Turku University Central Hospital
Medical College of Georgia

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The ant icipated effort is intended to be sole source to Hamilton Sundstrand (Hamilton), 1 Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, Connecticut 06096.  The DSC will possess extensive fault detection functions for its associated hardware, processors, sensors, and actuators th rough its Built-In-Test capabilities. The use of the DSC on UH-60A/L Blackhawk helicopters will result in replacement of two boxes with a single box, retention of all existing functionality provided by the AM-7106E/A Stabilator Amplifier, and enhanced capa bilities at reduced costs and significantly improved reliability.  The Mean-Time-Between-Failure rate for the DSC is expected to be 10,000 hours, which is 30 times higher than the existing AM-7106E/A Stabilator Amplifier.  The Government is pursuing overlapping development/production efforts in order to minimize delays in fielding the DSC because of the critical need to reduce sustainment costs and increase equipment reliability. Despite the existence of a performance specif ication, no other source could meet the Governments requirements without significant time and financial investments.   The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511 with the corresponding small business size standard of 750 employees.  The proposed action is for an estimated quantity of 1800 units over the life of the contract.  The contractor must meet a delivery schedul e of 100 units 360 days after contract award, and 100 per month thereafter until completion.  Inspection and Acceptance will be at source.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for an Aircrew Helmet Noise Request for Information (RFI) for an Aircrew Helmet Noise Reduction (AHNR) system designed to integrate with the HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P flight helmets. Responses to this RFI are due no later than 1 Nov 2006.

1.0 DESCRIPTION

The 648 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) is seeking feedback on the Draft Statement of Work (SOW), the Draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and the Final Performance Specification for AHNR. The AHNR is an integrated helmet noise reduction system which will effectively reduce noise in all phases of flight in multiple platforms and crew positions that require use of the Air Force HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P helmets.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

- Will the purposed systems be able to use existing communication testers (MQ-1, Scot, and Manside testers) to perform required inspections on the AHNR
- Is SOW paragraph 3.2.10, windblast requirement, clearly defined
- Is SOW paragraph 3.2.11, training requirements, clearly defined
- Is the Air Force going to need any additional data (other than that listed in 3.2.11) in order to train personnel to use this system
- Are the CDRLs reasonable as far as delivery time and delivery requirements
- Is the period of performance accurate for delivery of production representative units, can it be shorten?
- If awarded as a fixed price contract, give project milestones for invoicing/payment schedule

2.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to open a dialogue with industry and other communities of interest, to ensure to the maximum extent possible that industry input and comments are given proper and due consideration in development of the Air Force AHNR. The RFI is also expected to help 648 AESS/TA to complete indicative costing of the AHNR solution.

This RFI is for planning purposes only, and there is no intention to award any contract based on this RFI. The Government will not compensate any interested party, firm, or individual that may choose to provide a response to this RFI.

NIDDK will be seeking an organization or an institution to provide technical support services for the NIDDK Epidemiology Coordinating Committee. The contractor will be responsible for the following requirements (tasks):

1)      Epidemiologic Research in Diabetes/Endocrinology/Metabolic Diseases, in Digestive Diseases/Nutrition/Obesity, and in Kidney/Urologic/ Hematologic Diseases: 
	The Contractor shall collaborate with NIDDK Epidemiology Committee scientists in conducting original scientific research relating to diabetes/ endocrinology/ metabolic diseases, to digestive diseases/ nutrition/ obesity, and to kidney/ urologic/ hematologic diseases. 

2)	Biostatistical Consultation: 
	The contractor shall provide statistical consultation in determining the correct and most efficient approach and the technical feasibility of specific proposed analyses, considering such factors as total sample size, cell size, missing data, etc.; and shall provide consultation to NIDDK Epidemiology Committee scientists as requested regarding statistical assessment of the complex NCHS data tapes and other data sources.  

3)	Data Management, Data Processing, and File Documentation:  
	The contractor shall procure and maintain complex data files from epidemiologic surveys and other data sources; re code data to create new variables or scales which are logical functions of existing variables; merge data files; and construct working subfiles.  

4)    Biomedical Literature Review and Preparation of Reports for an Educated Lay 
       Audience:  
      The contractor shall review the published biomedical and epidemiology literature,    
      select significant articles relevant to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of

       information intended for electronic access by the broader scientific community.



The success of this project depends extensively on the capabilities and qualifications of the contractor's staff.  The NIDDK considers the contractor's project manager, epidemiologists, biostatistician, and senior computer programmer to be key personnel.

The project manager will be responsible for implementation and monitoring of all contract activities.  This person must have evidence of previous successful managerial and supervisory experiences in biomedically-?related work involving management and analysis of complex data files; commitment and demonstrated leadership ability of such projects; ability to facilitate activities of scientific and technical personnel such as epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and computer programmers; ability to implement and monitor all contract activities; ability to coordinate logistics, planning, and documentation for the project; ability to anticipate potential problems and expedite necessary corrective action;  ability to assess potential needs and plan to fulfill these needs; ability to facilitate the coordination of logistics, planning, and documentation for the project; and ability to prepare intelligible written reports that document activities, plans, and progress of contract activities.

Three epidemiologists must be available on the contractor?s staff or through subcontract.  Each of the three epidemiologists must have a Ph.D. degree in epidemiology; or an M.D. degree with training/experience in epidemiology or public health; or a lower level degree with significant experience in chronic disease epidemiology.  It is required that one epidemiologist have demonstrated expertise in diabetes or endocrinology; that one have expertise in digestive diseases, nutrition, or obesity; and one have expertise in kidney, urologic, or hematologic diseases.  Each of the epidemiologists must have demonstrated experience in conducting and analyzing complex statistical studies in epidemiologic and/or pubic health contexts using large samples, complex data files, and a wide range of univariate and multivariate statistical techniques; experience in writing analytic and statistical reports; demonstrated ability to work in a consultative mode with other epidemiologic investigators; ability to clearly express themselves orally and in writing; and demonstrated ability to collaborate with computer programmers.  Demonstrated experience working with NCHS or similar complex data tapes and demonstrated familiarity with SAS and SUDAAN will be highly desirable.

The biostatistician should have a Ph.D. in biostatistics or a lower level degree with significant experience in biomedical research; demonstrated experience in designing statistical aspects of epidemiologic analyses; demonstrated ability to take both innovative and rigorous statistical approaches to analyses; ability to determine the most efficient and feasible approach of specific proposed analyses, considering such factors as cell size, missing data, etc.; ability to select appropriate statistical analytic methods for specific analyses (e.g., descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis, correlation and regression analysis, survival analysis, etc.) and apply these to specific analyses; experience in conducting statistical testing of complex stratified cluster sample surveys of the NCHS and other large epidemiologic studies; ability to collaborate in a consultative mode with epidemiologists; and experience in writing analytic and statistical reports.

The senior computer programmer should have understanding of and experience with epidemiologic analyses; ability to work with analysts in epidemiologic research in biomedical areas; demonstrated ability with the SAS computer analysis system; experience with performing SAS analyses on microcomputers; experience with the NIH Center for Information Technology computer systems; demonstrated experience in programming data from complex stratified cluster sample surveys such as NCHS data sets from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Hospital Discharge Survey, and the Health Interview Survey; understanding of analytic programs for statistical testing of NCHS and other complex survey data; familiarity with SUDAAN and other statistical packages for analyzing complex sample surveys; proficiency in statistical programming including univariate and multivariate analysis and statistical testing, correlation, and regressions; ability to prepare specialized tables, graphs, and histograms from computerized data; experience in data storage and retrieval; experience in manipulating large data files involving complex editing, merging, and updating functions leading to the construction of specialized working files from primary source data tapes; experience in converting files back and forth between SAS data sets and external files; and experience in uploading and downloading such files.
The key personnel are expected to work closely with the NIDDK Project Officer, the individual scientists in the NIDDK Epidemiology Coordinating Committee, and other NIDDK staff.

<DESC>The Bureau has acquired new Super Orlof Intaglio printing presses from KBA Giori.  The Super Orlof printing press uses both an indirect and direct inking process for applying ink to the printing plates.  The indirect inking process is similar to the dry offset inking process.  The BEP will use the indirect inking process of the press.  Therefore, the Bureau is conducting a developmental effort with interested intaglio ink suppliers to develop a formulation for both the green and black inks that will optimize the Bureaus print quality and press performance of the Super Orlof Intaglio printing press.  

For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit a 5 pound retain sample of a green intaglio ink and a black intaglio ink with MSDSs for laboratory testing and review.  The VOCs for the inks shall be 12.0 percent or less.  If the retain sample is approved, then the interested ink supplier will be requested to submit approximately 50 pounds for the initial press trial.  Additional quantities of up to 500 pounds of the ink may be requested for a scale up press trial. Ink suppliers may be present during press trials; however, press trials must be scheduled based on the Governments needs and schedules.

Attached is a copy of the current intaglio ink performance specification for the I-10 Intaglio presses.  Interested ink suppliers should use this specification as a general guide for developing intaglio inks for the Super Orlof press.  

The Bureau has an immediate need to identify production green and black intaglio inks for the Super Orlof printing press and as such this announcement will be open until such time as the inks are proven for BEP production use.  Based on this developmental effort and identified ink suppliers capable of producing the inks that meet the Bureaus requirements, a limited competition or a sole source acquisition may result.  

Information shall be submitted to Bureau of Engraving & Printing, Office of Acquisition, Attn:  Jennifer Sellers, Contracting Officer, Manager, Materials and IT Contracts Division, Office of Acquisition, 14th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228.  If you have any questions, please contact Joan Smoot, Contract Specialist on (202) 874-3236, email at joan.smoot@bep.treas.gov or Jennifer Sellers, Contracting Officer on (202) 874-3148, e-mail at jennifer.sellers@bep.treas.gov.

<DESC>Description The U.S. Army Program Manager for Close Combat Systems (PM-CCS) in conjunction  with the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Armament  Research, Development, and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), is seeking  sources for a Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM).  The BDM is an 83mm hand-held,  single shot, disposable, stand-alone, direct fire munition designed to defeat earth and timber bunkers.  It is manportable, self-contained, air-jumpable, air- deliverable (by pallet), and contains an interface for attachment of various  night vision and aiming devices.  Specifically designed for the close fight on  urban and complex terrain, the BDM is quickly trained and employed in a manner  similar to the AT4. As an expendable round of ammunition, the light weight  (not to exceed 17 pounds), compact (not to exceed 40 inches), disposable BDM  provides a highly lethal capability delivered in a safe, easy to operate  weapon that can be readily transported.  As a stand-alone, self-contained  munition, the BDM requires no maintenance, nor dependence on other systems;  however, its ease of use and lethality greatly enhances combat effectiveness.   All interested sources should provide information on design details and  operational characteristics, test data against the standard Human Engineering  Laboratory (HEL) bunker at 0 and 45 degrees obliquity, production capacity,  location of manufacturing facilities and status of any development.   Information should be based on minimum quantities of 400 rounds per year  (FY07-FY11).  Maximum quantities per year are as follows:  6,645 rounds for  FY07, 5,018 rounds for FY08, 4,978 rounds for FY09, 7,055 rounds for FY10, and 4,978 rounds for FY11.  In addition, the contractor should provide information  about Inert BDM Field Handling Trainers, logistics support, replacement  parts/components, cutaway and engineering models, and special studies and  analyses.  All U.S. and Allied industry are requested to provide information in their own format that may be of interest to the U.S. Army in identifying potential candidates.  Please limit your responses (printed material,  photographs, etc.) to 20 pages and submit no later than 30 days from this  notice.  This information may be submitted electronically to Amanda Margo, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army TACOM Picatinny, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, 07806-5000.   Email:  amanda.margo@us.army.mil.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or  Invitation for Bid, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S.  Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.   Respondents will not be notified of the results of the survey or results of information submitted, and telephone inquiries or emails will not be honored. No further information is available from the contracting office.

<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR has a requirement for the procurement of  two moist air incubation systems.  Each unit consists of a two-door moist air incubator with a 220 tray capacity; a refrigeration unit; an ultra-violet (UV) light filtration unit; a low pressure pump and high pressure pump; and a reverse osmosis filter.  This system offers Lahontan National Fish Hatchery the capability of isolating diseased eggs, the ability to mark the embryos since they transfer the eggs to the wild before they hatch and eliminates the need for formalin treatment to control fungus.  The moist air incubation system also requires less water which will reduce their energy costs.  Alaska Resource & Economic Development, Inc is the only known distributor of the moist air incubation system. The Service intends to award Sole Source to Alaska Resource & Economic Development, Inc.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not top open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1.

<SUBJECT>A -- Study Centers for the National Children's Study (NCS)
<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award up to 15 contracts to organizations having the ability to serve as Study Centers for the National Children's Study (NCS), if additional funds are provided in the FY 2007 President's Budget.

Expanding the National Children's Study to include additional Study Centers will require and is contingent upon additional funds being made available for the Study.  The proposed President's Budget for FY 2007 does not currently include funds for the National Children's Study.  However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have signaled strong support for the NCS for 2007.  The House Committee has included bill language "directing NICHD to dedicate $69,000,000 from within funds provided to continue the National Children's Study, including funding all Vanguard Centers and any other activities that were planned for fiscal year 2007."  The Senate Committee supported "full and timely implementation of the Study" [NCS] and stated that it has included funds within the Office of the Director to continue the study.  If funds were to be provided in 2007, awards for additional Study Centers is contingent upon the solicitation, receipt, evaluation and negotiation of technically acceptable proposals.  It is currently estimated that technical and cost proposals would be submitted in March of 2007.   Therefore, because of this expression of strong support for the NCS, this special notice is posted to alert prospective offerors to the possibility of awards for additional NCS Study Centers.  The solicitation for additional Centers, Request for Proposals, (RFP) is being prepared and posting it can be anticipated in approximately 8 weeks. The RFP that will be issued on or about December 12, 2006, will contain language that states that "funds are not presently available for this procurement and that the Government's obligation to award contracts under this RFP is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made." Offerors are advised that any expenses incurred in the preparation of proposals, will not be reimbursed by the Government. A RFP due date of on or about March 15, 2007 can be anticipated.   However, no resultant contract awards for new Study Centers can or will be made unless the FY 2007 Federal budget includes sufficient funds for the National Children's Study. 

Background information on the NCS is available at www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The NCS is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on children's health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors, both helpful and harmful, that influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The range of outcomes includes, for example, obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  Likewise, a wide range of environmental influences will be examined for their impact on children's health and development.   These include, but are not limited to air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, soil and dust contaminants, dietary nutrients, dietary contaminants, parental occupational exposures, infectious and allergic agents, genetics and social and behavioral characteristics.   The Study's goal is to better understand the role of how these factors, alone and in combination, affect or are associated with children's health, disease and development.   The NCS will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S.   Enrolled women and, when possible, their partners will be assessed for a wide range of exposures and personal characteristics early in pregnancy or upon pre-pregnancy enrollment.  Monitoring of the mother's exposures will continue throughout pregnancy to birth, and possibly beyond.  The child will then be followed for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and NCS defined environmental exposures throughout childhood until at least 21 years of age.  

Information will be collected from participants in the Study who reside in one of the 105 locations (mostly counties selected as primary sampling units for the first stage of a multi-stage sampling process).   The Study locations are identified on the map and list of Study Locations at www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations.   The information will be collected by Study Centers that perform the data collection activities in the locations or counties.   It is important to distinguish the Study Centers (organizations or institutions engaged in conducting the study) from the Locations (geographic areas, counties) where eligible participants reside. 

In the initial phase of this Study, data will be collected in seven geographic areas in the United States.  Data collection in each of these seven geographic locations is being conducted by a single Study Center, referred to as a Vanguard Center.  Thus, there are a total of seven Vanguard Centers. The Vanguard Centers will be engaged in completing and finalizing the core protocol and piloting the protocol prior to its full implementation. Contracts for the Vanguard Centers were awarded in the Fall of 2005.   

Additional contracts are needed to establish Study Centers to conduct the data collections in the remaining 98 Study Locations (from the original sample of 105 locations).  It is anticipated that a RFP to solicit proposals to establish additional Study Centers will be posted within the next 8 weeks.     It is anticipated that approximately 10 to 15 additional Study Centers which will cover 30 to 45 study locations will be awarded depending on available FY 2007 funds.  In addition to the requirements listed below, Study Locations, will be sought such that, in combination, births across the selected locations are representative of all U.S. births on a number of factors.  Future solicitations for additional Study Centers to cover the remaining locations are dependent upon availability of funds. 

Offerors competing for the 10 to 15 additional Study Centers must demonstrate the ability to conduct the Study in the locations that the offeror proposes.  Specifically, offerors must document in their technical proposal, the following:  

1.	Demonstrate a clear understanding of the complexity of this Study, including the use of a complex multi-level sampling strategies for selection of Study locations and neighborhoods within locations from which participants will be recruited; the longitudinal nature of the data collection; the need to collect, process, and ship environmental samples and biologic specimens from multiple sites; and the need to collect interview data from multiple participants including pregnant women, fathers, and other primary caregivers, and children;
2.	Demonstrate an ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings; 
3.	Provide evidence of the ability to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficiently large population of women, either prior to pregnancy or during early pregnancy, such that 1000 live births are enrolled in the study over a 4-year enrollment period in each location;
4.	Provide evidence of the ability to collect, process and ship/transport biologic specimens from mothers, fathers, and offspring; and environmental specimens from the household and neighborhood environment;
5.	Provide evidence of the ability to enroll participants and collect Study specimens and information (environmental, interview, and biologic) prior to conception and early in pregnancy;
6.	Demonstrate the ability to retain and follow Study participants from all socioeconomic groups, including the medically underserved.  [It is anticipated that measurements that require in-person contact will occur at least once in a subset of participants enrolled prior to pregnancy, two times during pregnancy, around the time of delivery, at 6 months, one year, 3 years, 5 years and every 3-5 years until the age of 21 years.  Collection of interview data may occur at more frequent intervals.];
7.	Provide evidence of the ability to collect cord blood and placental tissue at the time of delivery;
8.	Provide evidence of understanding and experience in packaging and transporting biological and non-biological samples to a laboratory(ies) and repository(ies) from the Study Center.  (Note: The National Children's Study, (NCS) Coordinating Center (CC) will develop standard operating procedures in collaboration with the Study Centers.);
9.	Provide evidence of the ability to perform a standardized examination of the newborn as well as other clinical and neurodevelopmental exams throughout childhood;
10.	Provide evidence of the ability (equipment and expertise available) to perform fetal ultrasounds; Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA); detailed developmental and psychometric assessments; placement, calibration and use of instruments to collect environmental samples, and other measures as selected in the development of the Study Protocol;
11.	Demonstrate previous experience in the implementation of Quality Assurance/Quality Control activities covering the collection of interview data; collection, storage, and shipping of biologic and environmental specimens; and collection of field observational data;
12.	Provide evidence of qualified personnel to oversee all aspects of the Study, as outlined above; and
13.	Provide evidence of previous work with a centralized coordination center in the development of protocols and procedures.


The following additional requirements must also be documented in your technical proposal:  

1.	Organizations proposing to become a Study Center must propose to carry out the Study at one or more of the 98 previously designated Study locations (see www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations). ).  
2.	Study Locations (Counties) where a proposing Study Center offers to conduct the study must be located either in the state where the proposing Study Center is located or in a state that is contiguous with the state of the proposing Study Center.   Location of the Study Center is considered to be that of the location of the primary institution in the proposal.  
3.	Where feasible, offerors are strongly encouraged to propose to be a Study Center for data collection in multiple locations.  [The government understands that this is not feasible for offerors located in Hawaii or in Maine, where only one Location meets the requirement specified in no. 2 above.  Offerors from these states will not be expected to bid on more than one Location.]  There is no limit to the maximum number of locations that an offeror may include in the proposal. However, proposals will be evaluated based on technical merit of which one aspect includes ability to engage relevant community entities within each location.  Other factors include, but are not limited to, costs and other factors to best address the needs of the full Study. 
4.	Only one center will conduct the Study at any single location.  Locations or counties may not be shared or split between more than one Study Center.  
5.	Organizations and institutions are encouraged to establish partnerships and teams with other entities where appropriate or necessary to establish the strongest capability to perform the Study. Each newly established Study Center awarded through this procurement will operate on an equal level with the already established Vanguard Centers.  Both the Vanguard Centers and the newly established Centers will operate under federal contract guidelines and will be equally accountable to the Program and Contracting Offices of NICHD. 
6.	Engagement and participation of the communities in Study Locations is essential for successful conduct of the Study.   Therefore, interested offerors are encouraged to establish relationships and participation with communities and community organizations of the proposed Study Locations.
7.	Organizations are requested to forward comments and concerns regarding anticipated problems and suggestions for the upcoming RFP for consideration by the Government in preparation of the RFP.   Comments must be received by November 16, 2006.  
8.	Offerors can anticipate that a pre-proposal or bidder's conference to answer questions and provide clarification about this solicitation will be announced and scheduled with the RFP.
9.	Current Vanguard Centers are eligible to submit proposals to serve as Study Centers for additional locations as outlined above.  
 
The Request for Proposals (RFP) is expected to be issued in approximately 8 weeks. Another Pre-Solicitation Notice will be published in FEDBIZOPPS prior to issuance of the RFP. Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Elizabeth J. Osinski, Contracting Officer, at osinskie@mail.nih.gov or addressed to Ms.Elizabeth Osinski, Office of Acquisitions, NIDDK, NICHD Branch, Executive Building, Suite 7A-07, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510,  Bethesda, MD. 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to a request for information (RFI). Question:  I note that the Asset Information sheet includes improvements that have "None" PI, "Book" PI, and "Sound" PI.  Are we to assume that only the properties with "sound" PI are to be appraised (this would include those properties showing "see comments" as well)? NPS Response:  The final possessory interest valuation includes the assets with PI marked "sound" and the "sound" portion of the assets with comments. For example the Lodge is sound value except for the covered porch, the total possessory interest value required is for the Lodge minus the porch.
