However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.

<DESC>You are invited to a Department of Defense (DoD) Biometrics Information Exchange hosted by Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) to facilitate Army and industry collaboration and information exchange of Biometric strategies. This event is intended to advance collaboration between DoD Biometric programs and industry partners in the areas of: Joint Personnel Identification Version 2 (JPIv2), Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) Increment (Inc) 1, and Program Management Operational Support (PMOS). <br> The JPIv2 capability will provide the operator the ability to collect, match, store, reference, and transmit a biometric modality and/or modalities of face, iris, fingerprints, and collect voice. The system will support a myriad of operational mission sets, ranging from a tactical austere environment to a mature, established Forward Operating Base. To support this range of mission sets, the biometric capability proposes the need for a man portable variant and a mobile variant. <br> The BEC Inc 1 effort provides the DoD with an authoritative biometric enterprise database repository. This specific Information Exchange is focused on the acquisition to support the development and deployment of BEC Inc 1 to provide enhanced capability to the current DoD Biometrics repository. <br> The PMOS effort(s) will provide DoD Biometrics and its subordinate PMs with support in program management and engineering.  Specific areas of program management include:  project operations, business management, strategic planning and analysis, administration, acquisition management, logistics management, budget, cost, and scheduling.  Specific areas of engineering include systems engineering and risk management. <br> ***LOCATION*** <br> The Information Exchange will take place on Tuesday, 30 July 2013, 0900-1600, at the Wood Theater, 6050 Abbott Road, Fort Belvoir, VA. <br> There are no registration fees and there is no hosted luncheon or beverage service; however, attendees MUST pre-register.

<DESC>GLOVES, MEN'S AND WOMEN'S HEAVY DUTY CATTLEHIDE
<p>The proposed acquisition covers a requirement for GLOVES, MEN'S AND WOMEN'S HEAVY DUTY CATTLEHIDE NSN 8415-00-268-7868(s) made in accordance with A-A-55060. This solicitation will be issued as a Small Business Set-Aside for an (IDIQ) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed type contract with a base year and two (2) option terms. The duration of each term will be one year. The base year minimum quantity is 13,290 pairs, and the annual order limitation quantity (AOLQ) is 66,450 pairs. Each of the two one -year term options will have the same minimum (13,290 pairs) and AOLQ (66,450 pairs) as the base year term. All materials used in the fabrication are to be furnished by the successful offeror. Best Value Trade Off source selection procedures will be used.</p>
<p>The following evaluation factors are incorporated into the solicitation:<br />1. Product Demonstration Model (PDM)<br />2. Past Performance Confidence Assessment</p>
<p><br />A Production Demonstration Model (PDM) will be required to accompany each proposal. Two pair, size medium, will be required.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance at source. Delivery of the first shipment is scheduled for 120 days (ADA) after date of award, 150 days and 180 days for follow on order. Shipment is FOB Destination. Destination: Austin, TX and New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) by the end of December 2013. Please note that all materials used in the fabrication of this item shall be furnished by the successful offeror. This solicitation is subject to the Berry Amendment, which means all components and all manufacturing must be obtained / performed within the United States. All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award. All responsible sources may submit offers which, if timely received, shall be considered.</p>
<p>--------IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT--------</p>
<p>Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through<br />9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.</p>
<p>DODI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DOD PKI identity certificates when accessing DOD information systems. The DOD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DOD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DOD and authenticate themselves to DOD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DOD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DOD Information Systems.</p>
<p>The following are the three entities authorized by the DOD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA<br />Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/ecalindex.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p><br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, and Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.</p>
<p><br />Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.</p>
<p>Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute anticipates the issuance of a request for proposals (NHLBI-CSB-DE-2014-09-CM) on or about December 6, 2013, on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).&nbsp; The requirement is to&nbsp;provide comprehensive clinical research operations support, management and data coordinating services for clinical research sponsored by NIDCR's extramural and intramural research divisions. The contract will provide NIDCR with clinical research management support and oversight tools to assist in the effective administration and coordination of its clinical research program. In addition, it will provide adjunct expertise and resources to assure sound and efficient clinical study design, study execution, data management and analysis, and regulatory compliance. Specific tasks performed will vary by clinical study and clinical site.<br /><br />As part of its overall research mission, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) supports clinical research on the causes, incidence, prevalence, prevention and treatment of craniofacial, oral and dental diseases and disorders. These studies, conducted extramurally through the funding of research grants as well as within the intramural research program, include Phase I-III clinical trials as well as population-based, observational, and natural history studies. <br /><br />NIDCR's extramural program has an extensive clinical research portfolio that covers a broad range of clinical efforts. Studies span small, short-term, pilot evaluations involving a single domestic site, to large, multi-year, multi-site clinical studies conducted both domestically and internationally. They include preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventional clinical trials as well as observational clinical studies. Intramural studies are generally performed in NIH's Clinical Center and include both outpatient and inpatient studies, although some studies are multi-center and include clinical sites outside of the Clinical Center. <br /><br />The current clinical research and operations management support (CROMS) contract (HHSN268200800017C) has centralized a number of oversight and management activities such as study tracking, data and safety oversight, and study monitoring. This approach has allowed some studies to be managed by a program specific coordinating center. Management of other studies has been undertaken by the current CROMS contract in a tailored, study-specific approach. This management approach offers flexibility to meet the needs of different extramurally funded programs.<br /><br />For clinical studies conducted in the intramural research program, unique, tailored arrangements are supported by each study. Coordination across these various entities as well as centralized operations support and oversight through clinical monitoring and safety oversight programs are managed by the current CROMS contract. <br /><br />Currently, the CROMS contract provides protocol writing and development services to nearly 20 studies, clinical site monitoring services for approximately 40 studies, data management services for 11 studies, and regulatory support to seven studies. Although NIDCR staff have expertise to assist with various aspects of study design and interpretation/evaluation of study results, these resources are finite. Through the retirement of a senior staff member, even fewer in-house resources are currently available to bolster the clinical coordination efforts needed to establish and maintain an efficient and high-quality clinical research program. Given the growing complexity and size of NIDCR's clinical research program, including the extramural program's focus on product development and biomarker studies, along with the growing number of intramural interventional clinical trials, there is a clear need for a centralized, standardized and cost-effective approach for NIDCR clinical research oversight and management.<br /><br />This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The requirement will cover 60 months and a "Cost-Reimbursement-Completion" type contract is being considered. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what fits the project's goals and the available funding. The RFP will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS website at http:fedbisopps.gov. Potential Offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and any/all attachments. It is also Offerors' responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS for any amendments to the RFP. It has been determined that this acquisition will be set aside for small business concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711.<br /><br /><br /><br />

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA; plans to issue a cost plus fixed fee contract in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, to Computer Systems Center Incorporated (CSCI) of Springfield, VA, on an other than full and open basis. CSCI is the only known source with the requisite engineering expertise and demonstrated technical capability to provide the network operational awareness capability, as well as the full motion video/imagery FMV/I receipt, management, and bandwidth dependent content propagation across Tactical Operations Center (TOC) tactical communications. Under this effort the contractor will continue to provide solutions to current technical limitations in the command and control of unmanned air vehicle and sensor (UAV/S) operations and data communications with current and future tactical aircraft. The delivered capabilities will be captured within an architecture for the TOC, or Command Operations Center (COC) that is being revised and updated based upon lessons learned from recent experiences in theater. At the heart of the TOC/COC architecture is a CSCI system, a previous version of which was developed by CSCI under contract N68936-C-13-0113 and successfully demonstrated in the TOC during the Marine Aviation Weapons Tactics Squadron (MAWTS). The system has been certified four times and approved for classified operations within the tactical SIPRNET at MAWTS and possesses a current IA certification. The USMC fixed-wing Marine Unmanned (VMU) TOC evaluation conducted in April 2013 at MAWTS was successful and resulted in requirements to procure additional systems with updated and improved software.<br />The estimated release date of the solicitation is on or about January 9, 2014, with an estimated award date of February 27, 2014.<br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Any questions regarding this requirement may be submitted to Kelley McClean at Kelley.mcclean@navy.mil or by mail at Commander Code 254100D, NAWCWD, 429 E Bowen Rd. Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6018.<br />

If the Contractor deems one area to have been developed/strengthened, it can then move on to the next tier. The work is to be performed in Ethiopia and will require engaging local staff and/or having both English and Amharic capability. The Contractor will also have to obtain a license by registering with the Government of Ethiopia.<br />The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to alert U.S. 8(a) firms and local Ethiopian firms of USAID/Ethiopia's intention to issue a request for proposals and to give these firms the opportunity to organize a proposal preparation team. This will be a competitive award.<br />Interested organizations are requested to provide electronically a brief 1-3 page capability statement describing the organizations capabilities and experience in building the capacity of small to mid-size organizations. In particular, their abilities and experience developing:

<p>Capabilities statements should be emailed to Girma Debelu (gdebelu@usaid.gov) and Gregory Taitt (gtaitt@usaid.gov) before 12 November 2012.<br />The Request for Proposals (RFP) for the LCD project is projected to be issued around December 2012 on www.fedbizopps.gov. USAID will not entertain questions until after the RFP is issued. When the RFP is issued, any amendments thereof will be posted at: www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.<br />The anticipated award will be cost plus fixed-fee. <br />Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to the availability of funds.

<a href="mailto:michael.d.stearns@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Repairs to the South Jetty at Newburyport Harbor - Newburyport, MA.  The estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. <br>  <br> Proposed work consists of repairing portions of the 1,400-foot-long jetty that was damaged during Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Sandy.  Approximately 12,000 tons of 6 to 12 ton armor stone will be required.  Crest width is 15 feet.  Crest elevation at the most seaward end is +12 feet mean lower low water (MLLW).  Side slopes are 1 vertical : 1 horizontal on the river side and 2 horizontal : 1 vertical on the ocean side.  The work includes replacing displaced core and armor stone to fill in existing gaps in the jetty.  Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement.  Repairs were begun on the first 600 feet of the jetty during the winter of 2012-2013 and will need to be finished under this contract.  About 6 days per month during the construction window, seas can be expected to be in excess of 8 feet in the river mouth. Equipment and stone delivery and access to the jetty may be performed from land, water or a combination.  Protection of piping plovers and their habitat limits any work by land from 01-SEP to 31-MAR.  If accessing by land, the expected storage / staging area for the stone, equipment and trailer is at the paved Newburyport parking lot, at the northern end of Northern Boulevard on Plum Island; access to the parking lot will be along Northern Boulevard in Newbury and Newburyport.  There may be restrictions on load limits and daily truck deliveries through Newburyport.  It is about 2,600 feet from the parking lot to the jetty.  It's expected that trucks will transport the stone from the parking lot to the jetty over mats over the vegetated dunes.  Northern Boulevard, the parking lot, dunes, and any excess vegetation damaged will be restored to their pre-construction condition.  About 5,200 feet of sand fencing will be installed along the access/haul route after construction, or by 31-MAR.  <br>  <br> This is not an IFB at this time.  The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about early-August.

<DESC>The Removable Spillway Weir in spillway bay 2 at Ice Harbor Dam is the primary passage route for downstream migrating juvenile salmonids. Biological tests and hydraulic models have shown that there is a potential for injury to some of the fish passing over the Ice Harbor spillway due to the steep slope and the abrupt transition to the surface of the existing spill deflector. To resolve this condition, the Corps is going to modify the spillway chute and the spill deflector in spillway bay 2 and add a new, permanent extension to the downstream end of the spillway pier between bays 2 and 3 at Ice Harbor Dam.    <br>  <br> The work will be accomplished by isolating the construction area from the tailwater in the stilling basin and dewatering the immediate construction area in spillway bay 2. Work on the spillway chute, deflector and the pier extension can then be accomplished in the dry. Some water leakage is usually present so pumping will likely be required throughout the construction period.    <br>  <br> The contractor shall remove approximately 100 cubic yards of existing concrete from the face of the spillway, leaving a roughened surface for placement of the new concrete forming the flatter spillway chute, new spill deflector, and the new pier extension. The removed concrete must be captured and not allowed to fall into the tailrace pool. Concrete anchors shall be drilled and grouted into the face of the spillway followed by installation of reinforcing steel. Concrete formwork shall be installed, and concrete for the spillway chute, the spill deflector, and the pier extension placed. Volume of new concrete required is approximately 1,200 cubic yards. All seepage water and other water from construction operations shall be removed from the work area for settling or other appropriate treatment. Should the need arise to spill water during construction; any support barges outside of the work area must be removed. Depending on levels of spill, construction may continue since the construction area would be isolated from the river. If spill is high, then it is likely that work will be suspended for safety reasons.    <br>  <br> Work must be accomplished during an extended in-water work window on the Snake River between November 1, 2014 and 28 February 2015. All new concrete must be placed by February 16, 2015 to allow sufficient time for it to cure completely to allow biological testing before court-ordered seasonal spill begins early in April of 2015.    <br>  <br> The construction magnitude is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. NAICS code for this project is 237990, and the small business size standard is $33,500,000 average annual receipts.  <br>  <br> Solicitation is open to both small and large business concerns.   Solicitation No. W912EF-14-B-0003 will be posted to the FBO website on or about December 5, 2013. The bid opening date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.   <br>  <br> ACCESS FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS: Security clearance for foreign nationals to attend a site visit requires approximately 4 weeks; therefore, clearance should be requested immediately. To request clearance, please submit the names of all foreign nationals proposed for site visit attendance, along with documentation to verify that he/she was legally admitted into the United States and has authority to work and/or go to school in the US.

NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<br />1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research on transport patient controlled analgesic pumps (PCA) suitable for use in patient care in the military expeditionary medical environment. Responses are due to this request for information (RFI) by 2:00 P.M. (EST) on 19 December 2013.<br />2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly.

AFMESA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future request for proposal (RFP).<br />3. BACKGROUND: Patients are transported in the military expeditionary medical environment with the need for pain management. Currently, the Air Force utilizes a PCA pump as one mechanism to accomplish pain management in transport. The Air Mobility Command (AMC) is collecting information on new transport PCAs to meet this need. The PCA must be safe and suitable to operate in the unique constraints of the military expeditionary medical environment. <br />AMC prefers commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items but will accept information on government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and foreign off-the-shelf (FOTS) products as well as research and development (R&amp;D) options.<br />4. REQUIREMENTS: The PCA sought must operate in an austere environment with the ability to easily and safely transition with the patient throughout the continuum of care. <br />Responses should address the requirements identified in this RFI, particularly those outlined in 4A below.<br />4A. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:<br />The candidate PCA pump must satisfy the following requirements:<br />1. Device should be "approved for market" (PMA), "cleared to market" (510k), or "legally marketed" (as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations - 21 CFR807.92(a)(3) for class I and II devices).<br />2. Device should be able to meet all DOD Air Worthiness Certification (AWC), Joint En Route Care Equipment Test Standard (JECETS), and Military Standard 810G Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests (MIL-STD-810G).<br />3. The PCA pump must be transportable by an ambulatory patient via a carrying container or other mechanism and must be capable of mounting securely to existing transport devices for litter or wheelchair patients.<br />4. The PCA pump must weigh less than 3 lbs (1.4 kilograms).<br />5. The PCA pump must be capable of delivering continuous (basal) and/or dosed IV medications with or without using a patient controlled mechanism (e.g., button or other demand mechanism).<br />6. The PCA pump must operate continuously on battery power for at least 8 hours.<br />7. The PCA pump must be capable of using common disposable batteries (i.e., size AAA, AA, C, or D) or rechargeable batteries that utilize 110 VAC power, 50-60 Hz.<br />8. Batteries must be contained within the PCA pump and conform to the transport and weight constraints above.<br />9. Narcotic medications must be locked (to prevent tampering). Pump programming must be capable of preventing the patient from changing the program. <br />10. The PCA pump must operate in an environment 32 &deg;F through 140 &deg;F for 2 hours (T), 4 hours (O).*<br />11. The PCA pump must be capable of long-term storage in a facility that is not environmentally controlled (e.g., -40 &deg;F through 140 &deg;F)<br />12. The PCA pump must be capable of operation and storage in environments with humidity levels of 0 to 90 percent.<br />13. Pump must maintain a 48-hour history with the ability to query reports for shorter time frames without losing the 48-hour history.<br />14. Pump must have a mechanism for the user to collect and transfer historical information on use, medication, amounts, and timeframes.<br />15. Pump must have audible and visual alarms (T) and haptic alarms (O).*
<p>16. Pump must have a lock out for patient controlled mechanism. If the dosage maximum is reached the pump will not activate. <br />17. Pump must be equipped with a customizable on-board drug library and be equipped with drug calculation software (i.e., concentration of medication equals mg delivered over time).<br />18. Pump should not use proprietary consumables. <br />19. Medication should be able to be locked inside or onto the pump.<br />20. The button/mechanism used by the patient to trigger medication delivery SHOULD NOT be part of the programming/clearing/review function of the device.<br />*A requirement normally has a threshold (T), representing the required value, and an objective (O), representing the desired value.<br />5. RESPONSE INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be submitted to Ms. Ashley A. Fredlock, Market Research Analyst, via e-mail to AFMSA.SG5T.Market@us.af.mil. Email responses should be no larger than 10 MB in size. If larger attachments are required, please notify AFMESA at the above listed email address.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Aircraft Flare Parachute LUU-19 B/B, NSN 1370-01-537-9304. FOB origin. First Article Test is required for new producers. Estimated date of issue: 15 Jan 2013, estimated opening date: 15 February 2012. It is anticipated that a one-time award will be generated as a result of this solicitation. Point of contact is: Julie Coughlin (309) 782-6139, e-mail: julie.a.coughlin.civ @mail.mil. <br>  <br> This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. <br>  <br> The Air Force and Navy use the LUU-19 B/B aircraft-launched flare for nighttime illumination of surface areas in search and attack operations.   The LUU-19 B/B is derived from the LUU-2 flare. The two flares are identical in form, fit and function, except the LUU-19 provides a near- infrared illumination requiring night-vision equipment to detect. This enables its use in covert target illumination and rescue operations. The LUU-19 weighs 36 lbs. It consists of four major components: the mechanical timer, the parachute suspension system, the Out-of Line Igniter (OLI), and the case assembly with cast candle. The illuminant candle composition and igniter are proprietary to ATK Launch Systems. The timer consists of a mechanical timer and related hardware enclosed in a lexan plastic housing. The mechanical timer is a verge type, three-gear timer, powered by a torsional mainspring. A phosphorescent plastic decal with calibrated markings to indicate the feet-of-fall prior to parachute deployment and flare functioning is located on the face of the timer cover. The decal has a SAFE position and timer settings from 250 to 11,000 feet-of-fall. Under the pointer portion of the timer knob, and as part of the knob, a flexible arm is located with a detent that will retain the knob in the recess next to the corresponding timer setting. The timer knob has a quick attach-detach spring operated latch which allows the lanyard loop to be connected to the knob. A pawl release mechanism retains the timer assembly in the flare housing. A mechanical destruct feature makes the timer inoperative after it is functioned. The parachute suspension system utilizes an 18-foot diameter cruciform shaped canopy for stability. Two riser cables connect the parachute to a bulkhead separating the parachute compartment from the remainder of the flare assembly. One cable is attached to an explosive bolt for parachute dump at candle burnout. The ignition system utilizes a lanyard that is attached to one of the parachute riser cables. The lanyard is threaded through the bulkhead and past the candle in an internal raceway along the side of the aluminum case leading to the ignition assembly in the ignition housing near the candle's face. The lanyard is attached to a triggering mechanism consisting of the Out-of-Line Igniter (OLI). The pyrotechnic firing train consists of a percussion primer, boron-potassium nitrate pellets, and a propellant wafer. <br>  <br> The technical data package (TDP) is classified as DISTRIBUTION D limited distribution. Distribution D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet. The TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240 ET SEQ. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25. Only the top level drawing will be provided for this market survey.  Offerors must be registered with the Joint Certification Program at the following web site: HTTP://WWW.DLIS.DLA.MIL/JCP/DEFAULT.ASP, in order to receive a copy of the top level drawing. After receipt of required certification, the contractor shall request a copy of the drawing via email from Julie.a.coughlin.civ@mail.mil. Request must include: CAGE code, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and point of contact. <br>  <br> After receipt and review of the top level drawing, interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability. Please indicate your business size in your response. Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum monthly production quantities.  Additionally, it is requested you provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production. A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in the pyrotechnics industry. A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these items. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate and should describe his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. The estimated quantity for this solicitation is approximately 4,850 ea LUU-19B/B Illumination Flares.  Interested companies should also include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit price for this estimated quantity. <br>  <br> Interested parties have 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Any response to this market research should reference the following: LUU-19B/B Illumination Flare solicitation number W52P1J-13-R-0141.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Notice to Small Businesses<br /></strong></span><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from qualified small business concerns [8(a), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)]. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small businesses.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />Background<br /><br /></strong></span>This Sources Sought Notice replaces the sources sought originally posted on August 13, 2013, (SS No. FDA-Off-Site-RIM-00014). This notice is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this Source Sought is to help the FDA understand the market and technical solutions capable of providing the full range of services described in the draft SOW. FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully perform FDA's Off-Site Document Control Center requirements.
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's review of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this sources sought with any interested parties. However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the FDA may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Single Hybrid Firm-Fixed-Price/Labor Hour/Time and Material Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for each task or a combination of tasks (refer to Statement of Work). The ID/IQ will have a one-year period of performance plus four one-year option periods. The maximum value of the ID/IQ is estimated to be $103 Million. If at least two or more qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting) with a small business size standard of $14.0 million applies to this requirement. All documents applicable to this Sources Sought Notice have been submitted as attachments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p>Responses to the sources sought should not exceed 10 pages in length. They should be submitted via email to Tania Gates at tania.gates@fda.hhs.gov by 12:00 noon on December 4, 2013.</p>
<p>A complete response to the sources sought should include answers to all of the questions below. Please note that a respondent's failure to provide a complete response to a question will be interpreted to mean that it does not understand the question and does not demonstrate the capability to provide services required. Responses should demonstrate capability (i.e. specific projects), not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g.: The response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can scan documents.").</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Questions:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. The attached draft SOW describes the following major tasks under which task orders may be released to obtain specific services related to FDA's offsite document control center. Please demonstrate your capability for each of the following task areas:</p>

Except as specified in the Statement of Work, the contractor must be able to provide the facilities and infrastructure necessary to perform all task areas. Appendix A presents the initial set of off-site workload requirements for CDRH. It is anticipated, but not guaranteed, that the first task order issued under an ID/IQ for an offsite document control center would encompass these requirements. Further, task orders may require the Contractor to store the FDA documents for a period of time to be specified in the task order. In "Question and Answer" format, please provide the following information with respect to the facilities in which you would perform the work and/or your ability to obtain them:</p>
<p>&bull; Where is the facility located?<br />&bull; What is the square footage of the facility?<br />&bull; Do you currently own or lease the facility?<br />&bull; Does the facility current satisfy the security requirements set forth in the draft Statement of Work?

<p>3. Are there any gaps (task areas not included in the Draft Statement of Work) that you believe to be necessary to obtain FDA's objectives. If you identified any gaps in the task areas in the Draft Statement of Work, please describe any relevant projects where your company provided the service or support identified and what complementary objectives were achieved. Are the described task areas and the capabilities required clearly defined? What changes, additions, updates, and clarifications would you suggest?</p>
<p>4. How would you suggest pricing this requirement? Would the facilities and equipment costs be included in the fully burdened labor rates? If not, how would they be priced (e.g. per square foot, per piece of equipment)?</p>
<p>5. The IGCE for this requirement is not yet finalized; however, it is estimated that the ID/IQ ceiling could be as high as $103M for the FDA. Please briefly - no more than two to three paragraphs - describe your capability to staff and manage a project of this magnitude and complexity in terms of project scope and multiple task order awards. Also please describe any certifications (e.g. ISO or CMMI) that demonstrate proven management and quality outcomes.</p>

Is your Firm able to perform at least 50 percent of the requirements with in-house labor?</p>
<p>6.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice: Vendor Show - Defibrillators

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, estimates, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to view Defibrillators and obtain information regarding: (1) the availability of defibrillators and their various features (2) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources 

Background: 

The VAMC in Memphis, TN consists of one main campus located at 1030 Jefferson Avenue, which includes a 60-bed Spinal Cord Injury Unit, and nine community based outpatient clinics (CBOC).  It is a tertiary care facility classified as a Clinical Referral Level I Facility and one of the most complex medical centers in the VA system.  It is a teaching hospital, providing a full range of patient care services, with state-of-the-art technology, as well as extensive education and research programs.  Comprehensive primary, secondary, and tertiary health care is provided in areas of medicine, general cardiovascular and neurological surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, spinal cord injury, neurology, oncology, dentistry, and geriatrics.  Specialized outpatient services are provided through general, specialty, and subspecialty outpatient clinics including a women's health center.  Services are available to more than 206,000 Veterans living in a 53-county tri-state area (Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi). 

Of the nine active CBOCs in the catchment area, three are VA staffed and 6 are contracted.  In 2012, the VA Memphis South CBOC, located 8 miles from the Memphis VA Medical Center, provided primary and mental health care to 7,174 Veterans.  The VA Memphis North CBOC, located 11 miles from the medical center also provided primary and mental health services and saw 5,696 patients in 2012.  The VA Memphis Jackson CBOC, located 80 miles from the medical center, saw 6,390 patients.  The VAMC Memphis also has contract CBOCs located in Smithville and Byhalia, MS; Jonesboro and Helena, AR; Savannah and Dyersburg, TN, which provide primary and mental health care to Veterans.  As a result, the Memphis VA Medical Center CBOCs improve access and reduce the travel distance for approximately 33,000 Veterans in outlying counties. 

The VAMC in Memphis is part of the MidSouth Healthcare Network, VISN 9, which includes facilities in Lexington and Louisville, KY; Huntington, WV; and Nashville and Mountain Home, TN.

Some of the various features that should be addressed include manual and AED modes, waveform capnography, pacing mode, synchronization, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO2, biphasic defibrillation, life span, battery life, weight, as well as any other features that the vendor feels should be highlighted for their product. The objective is to provide information on available defibrillators for the medical center to evaluate for purchase.

<p>Scope Summary:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a firm fixed-price Design-Build contract for the Building 7 Structural Renovation, located in Auburn, WA pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Best Value Design-Build Selection Procedures (FAR Subpart 15.3).</p>
<p>The design-build scope of work includes all labor and materials required to provide architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to design and upgrade for the modernization of an existing building resulting in a facility compliant with applicable structural code requirements.</p>
<p>Related services include, but are not limited ACM abatement, testing, inspection &amp; monitoring during construction.</p>
<p>The proposed project is a Structural Upgrade of the Auburn Building 7 / SSA in Auburn, WA, to include major structural, seismic and roofing upgrades and window and roof energy efficiency measures. <br /> <br />The site encompasses approximately 169,000 gross square feet of one story space with an additional 36,500 SF of mezzanine space.  Also, a portion of the facility has a structural ceiling support / mechanical access mezzanine.  The occupancy is primarily office, studio and training center spaces for regional and local federal tenant agencies.</p>
<p>A.	Project Identification</p>
<p>Title: 	Building 7 Structural Renovation<br />Location:	Auburn, WA<br />Address:	1901 C Street SW, Auburn, WA, 98001</p>
<p>Building 7 is located at 1901 C Street, Auburn, WA 98001.  The facility was designed and constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943 and was remodeled for the Social Security Administration in 2006.  The building's roof structure primarily consists of wood trusses supported on solid sawn wood columns.  Several roof truss members have been damaged recently, most likely as a result of the heavy snowfall in January 2012.  Subsequent studies have identified significant deficiencies relative to current code requirements for both vertical and lateral building elements.  This project is intended to rectify these issues.</p>
<p>B.	Project Background<br />The roof trusses were constructed with solid sawn green lumber of quality typically used in the 1940s.  Since January 2012, a number of repair projects have been undertaken to mitigate structural damage to the roof trusses.  In addition, the GSA has commissioned studies which identified significant structural deficiencies and potential renovation methods.  The GSA intends to utilize the expertise of the selected D/B Team to upgrade the subject facility to meet IBC Structural Requirements.</p>
<p>This is a modernization project, as further defined in the PBS-P100 Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service.  (See the Standards and Criteria Documents section under General Requirements below.).</p>
<p>1.	Project Objectives<br /><br />a.	Upgrade facility to meet 2012 International Building Code (IBC) vertical load requirements.  Work includes but is not limited to the upgrade of all deficient roof trusses.  The D/B team shall be responsible for the method of upgrade and implementation of same.  In addition, D/B Team shall verify adequacy of columns, walls, foundation elements and other portions of the structural system as appropriate.<br /><br />b.	Upgrade facility to meet current IBC lateral load requirements.  Lateral system work is primarily anticipated to involve the southern &frac12; of the facility but limited work may be required within the northern &frac12;.  Work potentially includes new diaphragm sheathing, new chord ties, new lateral frames and/or shear walls and new or upgraded foundations.  In addition, unreinforced masonry and hollow clay tile walls shall be upgraded, reinforced, braced or replaced with compliant construction.  <br /><br />c.	Re-roof entire facility and install 20 year warranty roof membrane with minimum R30 roof insulation.<br /><br />d.	Protect and/or remove and re-install all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire sprinkler and other systems to "before project" condition.  Systems in northern &frac12; of facility (SSA Teleservice Center) shall remain fully operational throughout the project.<br /><br />e.	Protect government property from damage during repair work and maintain clean project area free of excessive dust, debris and odors.  Note that studio equipment in Bay 3 is high value and extra effort to protect this equipment should be anticipated and included.<br /><br />f.	Re-clad the southern &frac12; of the facility to match exterior cladding on northern &frac12; installed as a part of the 2004 SSA Teleservice Center upgrade project.  Add insulation to exterior closure to meet GSA Energy Guidelines.<br /><br />g.	Complete work within the Government's budget and according to the proposed project schedule.<br /><br />h.	Update facility BIM to document changes to structure and illustrate work completed under this contract.  Modify BIM model as necessary to comply with GSA BIM Standards and COBie requirements.  Provide as-built BIM at project closeout along with PDF version of as-built construction documents.<br /><br />i.	North &frac12; of Building - SSA Teleservice Center SSA will continue to occupy the Teleservice Center during construction.  Therefore the upgrade method proposed will need to be a method that minimizes disturbance. Work within this area must be accomplished outside of SSA's operating hours which are, typically, 6:00 am through 7:00 pm Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays.  The Northern &frac12; of the facility is compliant with current IBC lateral force requirements so it is anticipated that vertical force requirements will be the predominate effort.  However, the contractor shall verify the adequacy of the lateral force system and perform upgrades as needed for code compliance.&nbsp;<br /><br />j.	South &frac12; of Building - SSA Training Center &amp; Vacated VBA Space.  In order for the south &frac12; of the building to become code compliant, it is necessary to perform a lateral system upgrade along with the vertical truss upgrade.  In addition, since the VBA space is vacant and the Training Center is able to be unoccupied during construction, a different vertical upgrade method is proposed for this space.  It will be necessary to add lateral and longitudinal shear walls or other lateral system elements to this area to bring the lateral system into code compliance.  Provide additional structural upgrades to meet or exceed current IBC requirements. The mechanical access mezzanine is deficient and requires upgrading to meet vertical and lateral code requirements.<br /><br />No assumption of existing code compliance shall be assumed and must be verified by the design-builder.</p>
<p>2.	Project Delivery Approach<br /><br />GSA envisions a highly collaborative design build delivery approach for this project.  The expectation is that the DB contractor will work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a project that meets the expectations and needs of team members and GSA's requirements for a structurally compliant facility.   The DB team will be selected through a best value / tradeoff selection process.  During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders and the CMa to ensure that all of the goals are addressed and that best value practices are utilized.</p>
<p>3.	Contracting Method<br /><br />We are proposing to perform the Project utilizing a Design / Build (D/B) Performance Based approach.  The goal of the project will be for the building to comply with the 2012 International Building code as adopted by the City of Auburn at substantial completion</p>

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT: THIS NOTICE IS MARKET RESEARCH TO SUPPORT INCLUSION OF A SOLE SOURCE (BRAND NAME) SPECIFICATION IN VARIOUS FY12 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The U.S. Army Engineer District, Alaska intends to specify the below listed item as part of larger construction contracts to be executed on various military installations throughout the State of Alaska. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Reference FAR 6.302-1(c), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>ITEM: Intelligent Parking Lot Controllers (ILPC), Model M210 from Vantera Inc. of Manitoba, Canada. THIS NOTICE IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No solicitation will be available as this sole source item will be incorporated into the specifications of FY14 solicitations for new Military Construction (MILCON) facilities throughout Alaska. The ILPC is a smart power receptacle which controls the amount of power supplied to engine block heaters that are used to warm engines in cold climate environments. The IPLC has a microprocessor that controls the flow of power to the block heater according to several factors including temperature, wind chill and time. The IPLC is factory programmed to automatically regulate optimum power flow to ensure strong engine starts at any temperature. By not supplying constant power, the intelligent operation reduces energy consumption costs by up to 65 percent. Each IPLC handles two outlets and each can be individually programmed to prevent use of in-car heaters or to meet the special needs of diesel engines or emergency vehicles. Red/green LEDs instantly indicate the status of the power outlet and user equipment including: a live outlet, a functioning block heater, an open or short circuit in the block heater or a circuit overload from an in-car heater. Salient features of the IPLC include: <br />A. Automatically controls the amount of electricity supplied based on ambient air temperature, wind chill and time. <br />B. Totally programmable via computer software to vary the amount of electricity supplied based on temperature.<br />C. Built-in microprocessor which keeps track of energy consumed with or without the use of the controller and provision to download data from the microprocessor.<br />D. Able to identify problems with open circuit or circuit overload via LEDs or other means.<br />E. Operates within a temperature range of -65F to 100F.<br />F. Provides 2 hour delay "on" when a vehicle first plugs into the outlet.</p>
<p>Vendors who offer similar products are invited to respond to this notice. Responses must include the following information:<br />(1) Identification of the manufacturer's name, address, and country of product manufacture.<br />(2) Fully detailed specification sheets. <br />(3) Narrative addressing how your product meets the salient features listed. <br />(4) Country of manufacture.</p>

The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Johnson Controls, Inc., 507 East Michigan St., Milwaukee, WI 53202, for the installation of a plumbing monitoring system in selected buildings and facilities at the University Drive Medical Center, University Dr. C, Pittsburgh, PA 15240.

<DESC>SINGLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION<br />(AC130 EWO Monitors)
<p><br />1. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>This action will be awarded as a sole source research and development contract. The sole source requirement will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation guidelines. A purchase order will be executed between Avalex Technologies and the United States Government. This requirement calls for an LCD Display, QTY: 3 ea, MFR: Avalex Technologies, PART#: AVM4170THD modified as required to meet the desired end state specifications and configurations.</p>
<p>Estimated cost is $115,000. The estimated delivery date is 60 days after receipt of order. The type of appropriation used is Research and Development 0400. Market research indicates the items are not available GSA. Market research also revealed that the item is available through a small business capable of modifying their existing commercially available monitor to meet the minimum needs of the Government. The requirement will be awarded as a sole source 100% small business set-aside under NAICS 334118.</p>
<p>2. JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLICITING FROM A SINGLE SOURCE</p>
<p>This justification is unique and the capabilities/supplies are possessed by only one contractor. Authority for this brand source requirement is conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)1.<br />The current AC-130U SAMS-ESA design calls for a: 17" Flat Panel LCD with a touch split screen, Bezel Keys, 1x RS-170 video ( tri-ax connector interface), 3x video inputs (either 3x VGA video inputs or 3x DVl video input or combination of VGA and DVI ), Heated Glass function, and 1280x1024 Native Resolution.<br />The 17" Flat Panel Monitor must be able to fit into an existing aircraft console cut-out and be equipped with rear facing connectors and interface to aircraft power (28VDC).<br />This 17" Flat Panel Monitor is part of an SAMS-ESA upgrade that replaces an existing aircraft system that uses an APR-46 Video Monitor. The APR-46 Video Monitor could not be used in the upgrade because it is outdated and did not meet the current mission requirements. In addition, repair parts are no longer available for the APR-46 Video Monitor. An initial proof of concept was utilized by the requesting activity and validated the Avalex AVM4170THD.<br />3. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION</p>
<p>This justification will be posted to the Government Point of Entry- Federal Business Opportunity. Any challenges to this justification will be brought to the attention of the Competition Advocate prior to contract award.<br />An RFI was originally issued for the initial proof of concept for the requirement in December 2012. The responses received did not meet the stated requirements which the contracting activity determined the need to redefine the requirement and post a RFQ. Two responses were received; one was from Avalex Technologies, PART#: AVM4170THD 17" Flat Panel Monitor. The second response was determined unacceptable.<br />Market research was conducted again in October 2013 to validate the above findings. A request for information was issued and the results were another estimate at a minimum of four times the IGCE.<br />Based on our market research that was performed during the period of Aug 2012 through October 2013, modifying the AVALEX AVM4170THD is the most cost effective approach to fulfilling the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>4. STEPS TO PRECLUDE FUTURE SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS</p>
<p>Through every available means, AFSOC/AFICA/CSF/SCP will continue to monitor market information and technical publications to determine whether any other source can meet our needs. In addition, minimum requirements for any future requirements as described herein will be shared with industry to encourage other manufacturers to begin producing similar compatible products.</p>
<p>5. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S DETERMINATION</p>
<p>I have determined, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), that the circumstances of this contract action deem only a single source is reasonably available.</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to award sole source award to Veramark Technologles.  The award will be made for the purchase of 1 year maintenance for the ECAS Call Accounting Software.  This procurement is being conducted under the Federal Acquistion Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy requirements and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  All inquiries and concerns must be emailed to SSG Jonathan Forren at jonathan.d.forren.mil@mail.mil no later than 4 P.M. Centeral time, 2 DEC 2013.  Any response to this must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government in future procurements.  POC for this SSG Jonathan Forren.  The following justifcation and approval is to provide for only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements: <br>  <br> 1.	  This request is for justification for other than full and open competition for the J6 Directorate of the TNARNG.  <br>  <br> 2.	  This request is for the VeraSMART maintenance and support for the ECAS Call Accounting Software that the TNARNG currently has in place <br>  <br> 3.	  The TNARNG currently has the ECAS Call Software that was purchased in 2010.  This software provides the J6 with the capabilities of detecting toll fraud and abuse, track client and project billing, examines productivity by department, and documents emergency calls and suspicious calling activity.  The maintenance agreement for this software, which is solely provided by Veramark, provides the following support: live telephone support during workdays from 8 a.m to 8 p.m. eastern, 24/7 access to Veramark's customer portal, free upgrades to the ECAS Software, free training, monthly updates to area codes and prefix codes and quarterly newsletters.   <br>  <br> 4.	  Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> 5.	  The TNARNG currently has the Veramark ECAS Call Accounting Software in place, and is being utitlized.  Previous procurements of the annual maintenance agreement took place using the Government Purchase Card (GPC), however this year's renewal amount surpassed the GPC service threshold of $2,500.00.  If the J6 were to choose a separate maintenance and support package, it would not be compatible with the current existing software.  This would require the purchase of a new software package and maintenance/support program which could be cost prohibited and repetitious to the current system. <br> 	 <br> 6.	  No other efforts were made to receive quotes for this procurement.  A notice of awarding this contract as a sole source will be posted on FBO for 10 days after award. <br>  <br>  <br> 7.	  It was determined by using the FY13 contract, W912L7-13-P-0054 with Veramark for the annual maintenance and support that the anticipated cost for the renewal of the agreement will be fair and reasonable to the government. <br>  <br> 8.	  Market Research was not conducted as it was determined that Veramark is the only provider of this maintenance agreement, and purchasing this agreement with the current Veramark software in place is more cost effective than soliciting a brand new software/maintenance package. <br>  <br> 9.  Letter provided by Veramark as sole source vendor suggests the use of other than full and open competition. <br>  <br> 10. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition. <br>  <br> 11. No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken as Veramark is the only company that provides the support and maintenance to their software. <br>  <br> 12. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br>

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - R (GOES-R) Ground Segment Project (GSP) announces its intention to loan GOES Rebroadcast (GRB) Simulators to interested parties beginning on or about November 20, 2013.  <br />GOES-R Rebroadcast (GRB) is the primary space relay of Level 1b data products and Level 2+ Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) data products from GOES-R. Level 1b products consist of instrument and scientific data with radiometric and geometric correction applied to produce parameters in physical units. These data are available to all users with GRB receivers in view of a GOES-R series satellite at the East or West operational longitudes.</p>
<p>GRB is the new data format for GOES-R that will replace the GOES VARiable (GVAR) service when GOES-R becomes operational.  GRB will provide full resolution, calibrated, navigated, near real-time direct broadcast data.</p>
<p>The GRB Simulators allow for on-site testing of user ingest and data handling systems, aka GRB field terminal sites. Each unit simulates GRB downlink functionality by generating Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) formatted GRB output data based on user-defined scenarios, test patterns, and proxy data files.<br />Four GRB simulators have been designated for loan to borrowers who manufacture GRB receivers and other users interested in testing their receive systems. The objective is to allow borrower access to simulators to verify GRB receive system compatibility with the GRB transmission.</p>
<p>Currently, the launch of GOES-R is scheduled for 2016.  More information about the GOES-R Program is available at www.goes-r.gov.</p>
<p>THE GRB SIMULATOR AND ITS MANUAL ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT EXPORT CONTROL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS (EAR), 15 CFR PARTS 730-774.  EXPORT OF THE SIMULATOR, ITS MANUAL, OR ANY OF THE DATA CONTAINED THEREIN TO ANY FOREIGN COUNTRY OR DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA TO ANY NON-U.S. PERSON MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.</p>
<p>Loans are not to exceed 90 (ninety) days without advance written permission from the Government, and may be subject to a waiting list.  Loan requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis, with the date and time stamp of the initial e-mail request serving to identify place in line.</p>
<p>Shipping costs will be the responsibility of the interested party to and from the Harris facility.   Harris Corporation will provide an initial set-up and training capability if needed, at no cost to the interested party.  Official Loan Agreement, logistics and further information will be provided upon completion of the loan request.</p>
<p>Interested parties should adhere to the following process when requesting the loan of an available GRB Simulator:</p>
<p>Send an email to:</p>
<p>GOES-R Project<br />GRBSimulator@noaa.gov</p>
<p>In the Subject Line, type the following text:  GRB Simulator Loan Request</p>
<p>In the body of the message, specify, at a minimum:</p>
<p>Requested start date, <br />Requested end date,<br />Organization name and location, <br />Delivery address, <br />Training support requested (yes or no),<br />Responsible party</p>
<p>For further information, please contact <br />GOES-R Project<br />Kathleen Fontaine<br />kathy.fontaine@nasa.gov<br />Kathy.fontaine@noaa.gov</p>

 This requirement will include the following characteristics:  CIRCA S CATH PROBES-Single Use 10 French and 50cm Working Length.
Product Description: CIRCA S-CATH PROBES for the Circa Temperature Monitoring System
This temperature monitoring system is a next generation system that greatly increases the safety of our patients during complex atrial fibrillation ablations. The S-CATH  probe, which is inserted into the esophagus, has 12 ultra-sensitive temperature sensors. These sensors constantly monitor the internal temperature of the esophagus during radio-frequency ablation thereby preventing one of the most devastating complications of this procedure, left atrial-esophageal fistula. The system sounds an audible tone indicating that the temperature is rising and an alarm if the temperature reaches or exceeds the programmed parameters. Since the esophagus is not visible on X-ray, this device not only monitors the temperature of the esophagus, but also allows the physician to visualize the exact location of the esophagus due to its radiopaque characteristics. 
Salient Characteristics- o 10 French OD
o 12 Integrated Rapid-Response Temperature Sensors
o 50ms Refresh Rate (20-times-per-sensor-per-second)
o Two-Plane Self-Expanding Radiopaque Design
o Straightening Stylet for Insertion and Delivery


This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Responses should be sent to Torben.Ohlsson@va.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to Microsoft Corporation for Microsoft SharePoint 2010 design review services. The total anticipated value shall be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.
<p><br />In accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b), the contracting officer has determined that Microsoft is the only source that can meet the SEC's requirement for Microsoft SharePoint 2010 design review services. Microsoft employees are the only individuals allowed to perform this type of service to Microsoft SharePoint software. Microsoft has authorized resellers, however; the price would likely increase under resellers because a "pass-through" fee could be charged by the resellers to subcontract for Microsoft employees. Therefore, the contracting officer has determined that Microsoft is the only source reasonably available that can meet the SEC's requirement.</p>
<p>The SEC intends to award a purchase order to Microsoft on or about December 2, 2013. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals. A competitive solicitation will not be issued. However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.&nbsp; Any correspondences related to this notice should be sent to Christina Turner at <a href="mailto:TurnerC@sec.gov">TurnerC@sec.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<a href="mailto:cvega@usgs.gov">cvega@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive purchase order to Drexel University located in Philadelphia, PA. The project will evaluate diatom assemblages from sediment samples collected by the USGS as part of post-Hurricane Sandy reconnaissance sampling efforts to provide information on the direction and magnitude of changes in water quality and aide in the discrimination between storm-related erosion and depositional areas one year from the date of award.
There are no option periods.
Drexel University is uniquely qualified to conduct this work as its personnel at ANSP have recently completed an inventory of coastal diatoms and associated inference models. This inventory, a first of its kind for the US Atlantic coast, will constitute the primary source reference for future taxonomic work in addition to existing published books on European coastal flora.
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
Email responses to cvega@usgs.gov or fax to 703-648-7899.  Emailed responses are preferred.
The NAICS code is 541711.  The size standard is 500.
The anticipated award date of the contract is November 27th, 2013.  The anticipated contract will be firm fixed-price.  A vendor must be registered at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ to be awarded the contract.

<SUBJECT>FY14 Market Survey for Project Labor Agreements (PLA)

<CONTACT>Melissa Renee McMillan-Cox, Contract Specialist, Phone 4436547235, Email melissa.r.mcmillan-cox@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (greater than $25M) within the Baltimore-Washington corridor. Projects may consist of new construction as well as renovation, repairs and upgrade projects.
<p><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts awarded by the Baltimore District Corps of Engineers in the Baltimore-Washington Corridor?</p>
<p>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?</p>
<p>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?</p>
<p>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?</p>
<p>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to the PLA?</p>
<p>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Baltimore District solicitation and any resultant contract?</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to Renee McMillan-Cox at melissa.r.mcmillan-cox@usace.army.mil no later than 3 PM (EST) on 4 December 2013. <br /><br />This is<strong> NOT a Request for Proposal</strong> and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. <br /><br />Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

<p>(ix) Addendum FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>Award may be made without discussions unless the Contracting Officer determines discussions are necessary.

Best value is defined as the offer that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government as determined by an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis among non-price and price factors.</p>
<p>The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offer or other than the Offeror with the highest non-price rating.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate price, technical, and past performance. Technical is more important than past performance. When combined, technical and past performance are more important than price. (End of clause)</p>
<p><strong>Volume I: Price</strong> - The Government will evaluate price to determine fair and reasonableness. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all contract line items (i.e., base plus option years). The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p><strong>Volume II: Technical</strong> - The Government will evaluate Offerors' proposed product specifications, capabilities, warranty, training, spare parts, and service/maintenance information.</p>
<p><strong>Volume III: Past Performance</strong> - The Government will evaluate the Offerors' past performance in terms of 1) demonstrated success of the proposed equipment; 2) reliability of the equipment; 3) vendor/product reputation; and 4) references. BEP may contact those references during the evaluation process to verify product capabilities, reliability, and product reputation. BEP may, at its discretion, obtain and evaluate information from sources other than those provided by the Offeror.</p>
<p>The lack of recent and relevant past performance information will result in the assignment of a neutral rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable).</p>
<p>(x) FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial (AUG 2013) Items applies to this acquisition.</p>

<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Helium</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Monterey, CA has a separate launch facility in Oakland, California that launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4 pm Pacific Time. Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium (between 480 and 2,720 CF per week) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS office located at 6100 Old Earhart Rd. Oakland, CA 94614. The total amount of helium to be delivered for this requirement will normally be between 2,240 and 2,400 CF every other week (bi-weekly), but may go as high as 2,720 CF bi-weekly (between 58,400 and 70,720 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2014, with the option to extend up to four additional years.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 6100 Old Earhart Rd. Oakland, CA 94614. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building. The building is located inside a locked-fence compound area. A key for this area will be provided to the Contractor upon contract award. The key shall be returned to the NWS upon contract termination.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 14 cylinders of helium at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 480 and 2,720 CF of helium, with a minimum of 2,240 CF being used bi-weekly, leaving approximately a three-day supply of helium as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. Actual usage will vary based on the need for additional balloon launches.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every other week, with the actual schedule arranged with the NWS Observation Program Leader (OPL), Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 9 below for contact information).</p>
<p>Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.<br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (OPL, MIC, or ASA) shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Initial and Recurring Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply to the Place of Performance 2,720 CF of helium, in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. Thereafter, the Contractor will replenish back to 2,720 CF of helium on a bi-weekly basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty helium cylinders with full helium cylinders. The Contractor shall pickup the empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within two business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>A key to the fenced in area will be provided to the Contractor. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring the gates are properly secured upon departure. The key will be returned to the National Weather Service upon completion of the contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium to 2,720 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. SECURITY BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>Due to the Contractor being permitted unsupervised access to the site, a basic security background investigation must be completed for all personnel who will have access to the gate key. The Contractor is required to designate at least one, but no more than three, contractor personnel to perform the helium deliveries. Prior to the key being issued, the designated personnel must pass a fingerprint check performed by the Department of Commerce Western Region Security Office (WRSO).</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for providing, at its own expense, all information necessary to complete the security investigation, including official fingerprint charts. The fingerprint charts shall be provided to the ASA for submission to the WRSO at least one week prior to the first delivery date.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not assign any personnel that do not receive a favorable result of the security investigation to perform deliveries to this site.</p>
<p>8. SAFETY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.<br />Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>9. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices may be sent to the following address:</p>
<p>National Weather Service<br />21 Grace Hopper Avenue, Mail Stop 5<br />Monterey, CA 93943</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOTFOC)<br />1. Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd, Portsmouth, VA 23703</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />Procurement of Brand Specific and model specific VHF communications equipment for Vessel Traffic Service Houston - Galveston.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): <br />The proposed acquisition consists of the following:</p>
<p>Zetron Four Position Bundled 4048 RD/M4217, 14-Channels Positions: (4) Integrator RD Clients / M4217s and PC Workstations Common Control Equipment: (2) M4048 PSUs, (1) M4048 Console Card Cage, (1) M4048Channel Card Cage Cards: (2) System Traffic Cards, (4) Console Interface Cards (7) Dual Channel Tone/Local T/R Control Cards, Part Number: 905-0310</p>

<p>Zetron Integrator IRR Full Protection License, Part Number: 930-0048</p>
<p>Zetron IRR Multi-media Desktop PC Speakers, Part Number: 802-5006</p>
<p>Zetron 5.25" CRT Base Mounts a M4217 and is deep enough to stand a monitor on, Part Number 400-0205</p>
<p>Estimated Value: $95,000.00</p>
<p>4. An Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition: <br />The statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." And 6.302-1(c) Application of Brand Named Description. Zetron is the Specific Brand required, and Zetron Inc is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>5. A Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />The USCG is required to provide radio services to mariners in the VTS Houston-Galveston area. A Zetron system is currently deployed to meet this need. The system consists of deployed radio transceivers, a core unit located at the Sector and networking between the transceivers and the Sector.</p>
<p>The office is relocating. During the relocation radio services must be continuously available; no down time. This procurement acquires a separate core system to be installed at the new location. During the transition, the core system at the old location and the new location will both be able to utilize the deployed transceivers via the existing network. Both locations accessing the transceivers will allow the continuous availability of VTS radio services.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies: <br />A Brand Specific RFQ will be posted to the Government Point of Entry (GPE) FedBizOps with the statement, "Any Authorized Distributor that feels that they can provide the items exactly as stated may provide Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Cost Quotation in reply to this posting. "</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable: <br />Fair and Reasonable will be determined with the comparison of past purchases of Zetron items.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted: <br />A search of the items was conducted using the Internet. A listing of authorized Zetron distributors was located. Market Research showed Zetron Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer. This FBO RFQ is for 5 of the Items required, Market Research showed the other 13 required items listed on the Procurement Request were available via GSA, and a GSA RFQ has been posted via GSA E-buy for those 13 items.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: <br />This procurement is to buy a component which will interface with the existing system. This same Zetron system has been deployed as a standard configuration item throughout the Vessel Traffic Centers (VTC) in the USCG. Reengineering the Vessel Traffic System to include new communication controllers would involve considerable rework and expense: the purchase of spares for the depot, and retraining of maintenance personnel would cost will be over $150,000.00 at each VTC Locations.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: <br />No other interest has been expressed.</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required: <br />None at this time.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification: <br />I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.<br />James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>13. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel.<br />I certify this procurement meets the Governments minimum need and the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief<br />LT Art Plummer<br />Technical Representative</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>Discounts on invoices. If desired, the Contractor should offer discounts directly upon the invoice submitted, clearly specifying the terms of the discount.

<p>(2) Via the Payment Inquiry Form: https://www.fincen.uscg.mil/secure/payment.htm</p>
<p><br />(e) Invoice Elements: Invoices will automatically be rejected if the information required in subparagraph (a)(2) of the Prompt Payment Clause, contained in this Section of the Contract, including EFT banking information, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and DUNS number are not included in the invoice. All invoices must clearly correlate invoiced amounts to the corresponding contract line item number and funding citation. The Contractor shall work with the Government to mutually refine the format, content and method of delivery for all invoice submissions during the performance of the Contract.</p>
<p>(f) Supplemental Invoice Documentation: Contractors shall submit all supplemental invoice documentation (e.g. copies of subcontractor invoices, travel vouchers, etc) necessary to approve an invoice along with the original invoice. The Contractor invoice must contain the information stated in the Prompt Payment Clause in order to be received and processed by FinCen. Supplemental invoice documentation required for review and approval of invoices may, at the written direction of the Contracting Officer, be submitted directly to either the Contracting Officer, or the Contracting Officer's Representative. Note for "time-and-material" type contracts: The Contractor must submit the following statement with each invoice for labor hours invoiced under a "time-and-materials" type contract, order, or contract line item: "The Contractor hereby certifies in accordance with paragraph (c) of FAR 52.232-7, that each labor hour has been performed by an employee (prime or subcontractor) who meets the contract's specified requirements for the labor category invoiced."</p>
<p>(g) Additional Invoice Preparation Instructions for Software Development and/or Hardware.

<p>(h) Frequency of Invoice Submission This area is for the CO to document how often the contractor is allowed to submit invoices. An example is" Invoices shall be submitted on a monthly basis in accordance with the schedule."&emsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Special Contract Requirements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 H.5200.224.001 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION (AUG 2013)<br /></strong><br />Information furnished by the Contractor under this contract may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personally-identifiable information must be clearly marked.<br />Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the requirements of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.<br />In performance of this contract, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and information and must ensure that all work performed by its Subcontractor(s) shall be under the supervision of the Contractor or the Contractor's employees.2.2 <br /><br /><strong>2.2 H.5200.205.001 PUBLICITY AND DISSEMINATION OF CONTRACT INFORMATION (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>Publicity releases or commercial advertising in connection with or referring to this contract or effort shall not be made by the Contractor unless prior written approval has been received from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not publish, permit to be published, or distribute for public consumption, any information, oral or written, concerning the results or conclusions made pursuant to the performance of this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. Two copies of any material proposed to be published or distributed shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>A minimum of five full business days' notice is required for requests made in accordance with this provision.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 H.5200.244.001 INTERRELATIONSHIP OF ASSOCIATE CONTRACTORS (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with other such Contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other Contractor(s) for the purpose of such work.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and an associate Contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each Contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a "lead Contractor" for the project. In these cases the Associate Contractors shall also be contractually required to coordinate and collaborate with the Contractor. TSA will facilitate the mutual execution of Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>Compliance with this Special Contract Requirement is included in the contract price and shall not be a basis for equitable adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 H.5200.237.001 NON-PERSONAL SERVICES (AUG 2013)</strong></p>

The Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. Observance of such holidays by Government personnel shall not be a reason for the Contractor to request an extension of the period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract.</p>

<p><strong>2.16 H.5200.222.001 "INSTRUCTIONS TO CONTRACTOR REGARDING NON-DISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS UNDER SERVICE CONTRACT ACT-AFFECTED CONTRACTS." (AUG 2013)</strong></p>
<p>(1) Background: Service contracts and subcontracts with employees who are specifically covered by the Service Contract Act subject to requirements in FAR Subpart 22.12-Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts. Applicability. FAR 52.222-17, "Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers" takes precedence, if there should be any conflict with any information in this specific contract term.<br />(A)(i)This requires successor contractors under a newly-awarded contract to offer employment on a first right of refusal to Service Contract Act-covered employees under a current contract that includes FAR 52.222-17. When a service contract (which is any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered in whole or in part concerning its requirement by the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and its implementing regulations) succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. Executive Order 13495 prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided.<br /><br />(ii) Method of job offer. The successor contractor shall make job offers to current contract employees (who are covered by the Service Contract Act) as specified herein. The current contract is held by: (CONTRACTING OFFICER; INSERT NAME OF CURRENT CONTRACTOR, CONTRACT NUMBER, and OFFICIAL CONTRACTOR BUSINESS/MAILING ADDRESS). A job offer made by a successor contractor must be a bona fide express offer of employment on the contract. Each bona fide express offer made to a qualified service employee on the predecessor contract must have a stated time limit of not less than ten (10) days for an employee response. Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period, the contractor is prohibited from offering employment on the contract to any other person, subject to the exceptions at FAR 22.1203-5. Any question concerning an employee's qualifications shall be decided based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and a contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495. An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. <br />(iii)Exceptions to Job Offer requirements. (a) A successor contractor or its subcontractors are not required to offer employment to any service employee of the predecessor contractor who (1) Will be retained by the predecessor contractor. (2) The successor contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job. (See 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which this exception would or would not be appropriate.) (b) A successor contractor or its subcontractors may employ under the contract any of its current service employees who (1) have worked for the successor contractor or its subcontractors for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of the successor contract, and (2) would otherwise face lay-off or discharge. (c) The successor contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of the preceding exceptions and the exemption listed at FAR 22.1203-2(a)(5) involving nonfederal work and must provide notice of such with its proposal to the Government. <br />(B)(i) The predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The certified service employee lists must be provided not less than thirty (30) days before completion of the contract. The certified list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and subcontracts for services. The information on this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by paragraph (n) of the clause at FAR 52.222-41, "Service Contract Act of 1965." If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of FAR 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than ten (10) days prior to performance completion. The Contractor shall submit such list to: CONTRACTING OFFICER FILL IN ADDRESS. (b) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer will provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor.<br />(ii) Contractor Notification Service Employees. (a) The predecessor contractor shall provide written notice, the same or substantially the same as the model notice provided under Appendix B of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 9 to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. The written notice shall be (1) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or (2) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via e-mail, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. <br />(2) Enforcement methods. Contractors are hereby notified that all specified enforcement methods to ensure contractor compliance with these requirements may be applied at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and as such may be specified under direction from the U.S. Department of Labor.<br />(End of special contract requirement)</p>

Submitted Technical Descriptions shall not be longer than two (2) pages per item.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.&nbsp; THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br /><br />Request for Information<br />T-38A/C Forward Canopy Panel Redesign with Through-The-Canopy Ejection Capability,&nbsp; PN 2-13201-49, NSN 1560-00-886-1399<br /><br />This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI).&nbsp; This not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.<br /><br />1. Purpose:&nbsp;The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to redesign, test, and produce 550 ea. T-38 forward canopy transparencies to increase bird strike capability while maintaining the existing Through-The-Canopy (TTC) ejection capability.<br /><br />2. Background: The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology that meet, what can only be described as, &lsquo;conflicting' canopy performance needs i.e. maintain TTC capability and increase bird impact resistant capabilities. The current 0.23 inch thick stretched acrylic transparency can resist a 4-pound bird impact at 165 knots which does not offer a capability to resist significant bird impacts, and has resulted in the loss of six (6) aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts since 1970 were made to evaluate existing materials and redesign a transparency that could withstand a bird impact of 4 pounds at 400 knots. However, the increased transparency thickness proposal to increase bird strike survivability would have required modification of canopy operating mechanisms and addition of a transparency fracturing system, which significantly increased the cost of the modification. Although it would increase the level of bird impact protection, the proposal was cancelled due to the high cost of the modification.<br /><br />3. Scope of Task: <br />&bull;Develop a new state of the art technology that will optimize the transparency design to maximize bird strike resistance while maintaining a total transparency weight of less than 68 pounds. Maintaining the weight below 68 pounds will negate the need to modify canopy operating mechanisms and significantly reduce costs. The contractor's response to the RFI should include an estimate of final bird strike resistance. <br />&bull;Redesigned transparency must retain the TTC ejection capability. <br />&bull;Materials must be manufactured in accordance with aviation industry standards, design specifications, requirements, and tolerances.<br />&bull;Incorporate existing transparency to canopy frame, fuselage attachment fitting, and canopy support.<br />&bull;Redesigned transparency should be able to maintain or improve current aircraft optical requirement (Optical requirements must meet approval of qualified FCF pilot), or current industry standards. <br /><br />4. Information/Format: Potential offerors willing to become qualified source must be able to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR). Potential offerors shall provide information on relevant performance history and/or evidence of capability to satisfy this type of requirement, to include the NSN or PN (if existent). Potential offerors will demonstrate the offeror's infrastructure and integration capability to provide all aspects of this task to include but not limited to the following:<br />&bull;Manufacturing aircraft components, specifically canopy panels<br />&bull;Previous Government projects/qualification/approval/contract by similarity<br />&bull;Other pertinent data concerning your qualification to manufacture the required item.<br /><br />Please submit electronically your response in an executive summary format not to exceed 5 pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information. <br /><br />Final vendor RFI responses are due by midnight 11 December 2013.<br /><br />The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.<br /><br />For questions, comments or RFI response, please contact:<br /><br />Attn: Kimberlene Butler <br />Contracting Officer<br />DSN 775-3801 <br />6072 Fir Ave, Bldg 1233<br />HAFB UT 84056-5820<br /><a href="mailto:Kimberlene.Butler@hill.af.mil">Kimberlene.Butler@hill.af.mil</a>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<br /><br />Request for Information<br />T-38A/C Forward Canopy Panel Redesign With Through-The-Canopy Ejection Capability, PN-2-13201-49, NSN 1560-00-996-1399<br /><br />This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). This not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.<br /><br />1. Purpose: The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to redesign, test, and produce 550 T-38 forward canopy transparencies to increase bird strike capability. This does not require the retention of Through-The-Canopy (TTC) ejection capability.<br /><br />2. Background: The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology to optimize the design for maximum bird impact resistance. The current 0.23 inch thick stretched acrylic transparency can resist a 4-pound bird impact at 165 knots which does not offer a capability to resist significant bird impacts, and has resulted in the loss of six (6) aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts since 1970 were made to evaluate existing materials and redesign a transparency that could withstand a bird impact of 4 pounds at 400 knots. However, the increased transparency thickness proposed to increase bird strike survivability would have required modification of canopy operating mechanisms and the addition of a transparency fracturing system, which significantly increased the cost of the modification. Although it would increase the level of bird impact protection, the proposal was cancelled due to the high cost of the modification.<br /><br />3. Scope of Task: <br />&bull;Develop a new state of the art technology that will optimize the transparency design to maximize bird strike resistance while maintaining a total transparency weight of less than 68 pounds. Maintaining the weight below 68 pounds will negate the need to modify canopy operating mechanisms. The contractor's response to the RFI should include an estimate of final bird strike resistance. <br />&bull;Materials must be manufactured in accordance with aviation industry standards, design specifications, requirements, and tolerances.<br />&bull;Incorporate existing transparency to canopy frame, fuselage attachment fitting, and canopy support.<br />&bull;Redesigned transparency should be able to maintain or improve current aircraft optical requirement (Optical requirements must meet approval of qualified FCF pilot), or current industry standards. <br /><br />4. Information/Format:Potential offerors willing to become qualified source must be able to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR). Potential offerors shall provide information on relevant performance history and/or evidence of capability to satisfy this type of requirement, to include the NSN or PN (if existent). Potential offerors will demonstrate the offeror's infrastructure and integration capability to provide all aspects of this task to include but not limited to the following:<br />&bull;Manufacturing aircraft components, specifically aircraft transparencies<br />&bull;Previous Government projects/qualification/approval/contract by similarity<br />&bull;Other pertinent data concerning your qualification to manufacture the required item.<br /><br />Please submit electronically your response in an executive summary format not to exceed 5 pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information.<br /><br />Final vendor RFI responses are due by midnight&nbsp;11&nbsp;December 2013.<br /><br />The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.<br /><br />For questions, comments or RFI response, please contact:<br /><br />Attn: Kimberlene Butler <br />Contracting Officer<br />DSN 775-3801 <br />6072 Fir Ave, Bldg 1233<br />HAFB UT 84056-5820<br />Kimberlene.Butler@hill.af.mil<br />

<DESC>You are invited to a Department of Defense (DoD) Biometrics Information Exchange hosted by Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) to facilitate Army and industry collaboration and information exchange of Biometric strategies. This event is intended to advance collaboration between DoD Biometric programs and industry partners in the areas of: Joint Personnel Identification Version 2 (JPIv2), Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) Increment (Inc) 1, and Program Management Operational Support (PMOS).  <br>  The JPIv2 capability will provide the operator the ability to collect, match, store, reference, and transmit a biometric modality and/or modalities of face, iris, fingerprints, and collect voice. The system will support a myriad of operational mission sets, ranging from a tactical austere environment to a mature, established Forward Operating Base. To support this range of mission sets, the biometric capability proposes the need for a man portable variant and a mobile variant.  <br>  The BEC Inc 1 effort provides the DoD with an authoritative biometric enterprise database repository. This specific Information Exchange is focused on the acquisition to support the development and deployment of BEC Inc 1 to provide enhanced capability to the current DoD Biometrics repository.  <br>  The PMOS effort(s) will provide DoD Biometrics and its subordinate PMs with support in program management and engineering.  Specific areas of program management include:  project operations, business management, strategic planning and analysis, administration, acquisition management, logistics management, budget, cost, and scheduling.  Specific areas of engineering include systems engineering and risk management.  <br>  ***LOCATION***  <br>  The Information Exchange will take place on Tuesday, 30 July 2013, 0900-1600, at the Wood Theater, 6050 Abbott Road, Fort Belvoir, VA.  <br>  There are no registration fees and there is no hosted luncheon or beverage service; however, attendees MUST pre-register.

What happened to voice and DNA as important biometric modalities?  Are these to be addressed separately or will they be added to BEC requirements later?   <br> Government Response:  Voice is an objective requirement in draft BEC Inc 1 CDD, but DNA is for linking purposes only (as an objective). <br>  <br> 10.	A.  Will biographic and contextual matching and fusion processes have access to full BAT records or only EBTS fields?  <br> Government Response:  BEC office will be requesting Information Papers to state how biographic and contextual matching/ fusion can improve accuracy and performance in a biometrics encounter system for both full BAT Records and EBTS fields.  <br>  <br> B.  Will there be a change in how much/what kind of contextual data can be text via EBTS? <br> Government Response:  Defense Forensic Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is responsible for changes in contextual data that can text via EBTS.  DFBA is responsible for application profile updates and changes.  <br>  <br> C.  Will matchers have visibility into BI2R/AIMS?  <br> Government Response:  No.  BEC Inc 1 matchers will have no visibility to Biometric Identity Intelligence Resource (BI2R) /Automated Identity Management System (AIMS). <br>  <br> D. Do we need to detect US citizen PII?  <br> Government Response: No.  However, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of military personnel is embedded in a cell that may need to be captured and segregated from persons of interests and enemy combats. <br>  <br> 11.	BEC Inc 1 presentation DID NOT mention voice collection storage and/or matching.  JPIv2 did mention voice in same content of collection, storage and or match. Is there a disconnect on voice modality capability between BEC and JPIv2? Or is this strategic and or intentional?  <br> Government Response:  No.  There is no disconnect between the voice modality capability BEC Inc 1 and JPIv2.  Voice collection storage and matching is an objective requirement in the BEC Inc 1 draft CDD. <br>  <br> 12.	Assuming JROC CDD success in 4th QTR 2014, and award desired in 2nd QTR 2014. Would you make an estimate on the RFP date? Is there a draft RFP intended?  <br> Government Response:  The RFP is tentatively scheduled to be released in Fiscal Year 2015.  <br>  <br> 13.	Have you considered the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade (MI BDE) network enterprise for BEC? They have lots of storage and Continuity of Operations (COOP) sense. TCS has a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) in a PLY network for MDA.  <br> Government Response:  At this time, BEC office has not ruled out any potential solutions, but has not specifically considered the 66th MI BDE.   <br>  <br> 14.	Two major contractor types were cited: a software System Integrator (SI) and a  quote mark platform as a service quote mark  provider. If a provider has both can both be bid by the same company?  <br> Government Response:  Yes. The proposed bidder will have to comply with the solicitation requirements. <br>  <br> 15.	The 2015 BEC Inc 1 projected start date is a significant slide to from previously projected RFP and start dates. Can you address if this slide is principally due to funding issues/support or technical issues that could be accelerated? <br> Government Response: RFP release date is based on the Department of Defense's decision to balance strategic choices of sustainment of current capability with modernization efforts.   <br>  <br> 16.	What role will the current ABIS enterprise license play for BEC moving forward?  <br> Government Response:  The current enterprise license is not mandated; therefore, BEC office is open and interested in all solutions that meet the requirements and posture the program for affordable upgrades in algorithms. <br>  <br>  <br> 17.	What is the strategic view on the user access control query the EBTS contextual data?  <br> Government Response:  Access to the query tool will be based on an approved user list.  The user will be granted DoD approved logistical access.  Based on the user application profile (permission based access), BEC Inc 1 will provide approved users the ability to query biometric, biographical, and contextual information of stored encounters. <br>  <br> 18.	Who is the POC for BECs interest in PaaS and how will they engage industry to evaluate COTS capabilities?  <br> Government Response:  All questions/responses regarding the information exchange and subsequent RFI must be coordinated through Carmel Costa, Army Contracting Command-New Jersey at e-mail- carmel.m.costa.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> 19.

Does the form factor for JPI mobile include the palm reader and the ID card printer? <br> Government Response: The form factor includes the palm reader but no ID card printer.  <br>  <br> 6.	Do the devices need to simultaneously collect and match (e.g. collect from Subject B while matching on Subject A)?  <br> Government Response: Yes. The devices need to simultaneously collect and match. <br>  <br> 7.	How do you envision linking matches on the handheld with matches on the BEC to test/validify responses between the systems? <br> Government Response: The method for matching on the handheld is using the Biometrics Enabling Watchlist (BEWL) on the local database.  The primary mission of the portable configuration is to operate in a network disconnected mode and then provide network connection synchronization with BEC in order to furnish periodic updates to the BEWL.  Individual requests will be sent on a case by case basis to BEC for an automated response that a match was made at the authoritative database level.   <br>  <br> 8.	What false acceptance rate is minimally acceptable? Probability of ID minimum? <br> Government Response: The False Identification Rate can be ascertained using the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) for identification/enrollment of .5% and the FAR for identity verification .1%.  The False Rejection Rate (FRR) for identification/enrollment of .1% and the FRR for identity verification of <br> .5%. <br>  <br> 9.	A.  Could an identity have a combination of flat, rolled, iris, face, etc.?  <br> Government Response: Yes. <br>  <br> B.  What is the general mix of modalities for an identity (or what is the number of samples expected per modality for a full data set)? <br> Government Response: The general mix of modalities for an individual identity includes ten fingerprints (flat and/or rolled), two irises and one face (minimum front view).  There may be one or more complete data sets per identity with some IDs only consisting of one modality among 100K total identities for portable and 450K on mobile.  <br>  <br> 10.	Will PEO provide a data set (NIST-like) for developers to test system performance against 100k, 450k, 2p, palm, latent, voice, iris, etc? <br> Government Response: No. The government cannot provide a data set for developer in order to test performance. <br>  <br> 11.	What is the government's approach for product evaluation and test evaluation? <br> Government Response: The government's requirement will identify approach for product and test evaluation will be in the Request for Proposal (RFP). <br>  <br> 12.	What is the un-tethered battery run time for JPI devices? <br> Government Response: The un-tethered battery run time is greater than 7 hours. <br>  <br> 13.	What are the biometric performance (speed and accuracy) requirements? <br> Government Response: Match speed for portable is 2 minutes or less for fingerprints (flat and rolled fingerprints) and 15 seconds for irises on 100,000 records. Match speed for mobile 5 minutes or less for fingerprints (flat and rolled fingerprints) and 35 seconds for irises on 450,000 records.  The government is looking to improve matchspeed.  FAR is for identification/enrollment of .5% and the FAR for identity verification .1%.  FRR is for identification/enrollment of .1% and the FRR for identity verification of .5%. <br>  <br> 14.	Would PEO consider a CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) for advanced development in a cost sharing environment with industry/academia? <br> Government Response: No.  The government is anticipating the utilization of a COTS approach.  <br>  <br> 15.	Will there be multiple awards with down select? <br> Government Response: Yes.  The government is anticipating multiple contract awards with down select by Source Selection Authority, if Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) is approved.  <br>  <br> 16.	If the devices will be collecting and transmitting both classified and unclassified data, they will need Type 1 and Type 2 encryption and will need to be NSA certified. How will this be addressed with an entirely COTS solution? This will be both a cost and schedule driver. <br> Government Response: Currently Biometrics data is unclassified.  All platforms need to comply with data at rest using products that are FIPS 140-2 compliant for encryption and authentication.  FIPS 140-2 compliance means that a cryptographic module validated by NIST to meet NIST FIPS 140-2 requirements or the module has been approved by NSA.   <br>  <br> 17.	Define mobile vs. portable. <br> Government Response: <br> Mobile consists of form factor 14 x 14 x 1 and one man portable (includes peripherals and is transported in some kind of carrying device).  <br>  <br> Portable weighs less than 3.6 lbs, is able to collect fingerprints and iris scans, and can store up to 100 records. Also, portable devices can withstand environmental factors without a carrying device. <br>  <br> 18.	There is an ongoing evaluation of devices by CERDEC at Aberdeen. How will the outcome of that evaluation affect or inform the acquisition strategy for JPI? <br> Government Response: The current Communication Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) effort is not supported by JPI Product office. <br>  <br> 19.	A. There is a need for portable and mobile devices. Is there also a need for an enrollment station and the related enrollment application?  <br> Government Response: The desired capability includes the ability to enroll on both the portable and mobile variants.  The mobile capability would be for fixed station missions. <br>   <br> B. Do you foresee the deployed versions of the BAT enrollment software  quote mark end-of-life quote mark ? <br> Government Response: Yes.  It is the intent that JPIv2 will replace Biometric Automated Toolset (BAT). <br>  <br> 20.	Do you foresee requirements for biometric collection devices with non-cooperative subjects, at stand-off and on the move? <br> Government Response: Yes. The government anticipates this to be objective goals. <br>  <br> 21.	What are the two ACAT I programs? What is the acquisition timeline? <br> Government Response: The two Army Category (ACAT) I programs are BEC and JPIv2. The anticipated RFP release date for both acquisitions is Fiscal Year 2015. <br>  <br> 22.	What other DoD organizations are involved in the sustainment activities of JPIv2 and BEC? <br> Government Response: DoD Biometrics is the sole program office responsible for all acquisition phases of JPIv2 and BEC.  <br>  <br> 23.	Will there be IV&V to test biometric specific code? <br> Government Response: Yes. Program Executive Office Enterprise Information System will scan using HP Fortify to verify software code assurance and CAST for software code quality unless otherwise specified. <br>   <br> 24.	Industry can design and integrate a wide variety of solutions to address the areas of interest and top level requirements. However, the solution will ultimately depend on the available funding. Will the government provide a funding estimate for this project? <br> Government Response: No.  The government will not be providing a funding estimate for this project.  <br>   <br> This sources sought number, W15QKN-13-R-0191, was only utilized for BIE open dialog between industry potential offerors and the Government.

FOB origin. First Article Test is required for new producers. Estimated date of issue: 15 Jan 2013, estimated opening date: 15 February 2012. It is anticipated that a one-time award will be generated as a result of this solicitation. Point of contact is: Julie Coughlin (309) 782-6139, e-mail: julie.a.coughlin.civ @mail.mil.  <br>    <br>  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.  <br>    <br>  The Air Force and Navy use the LUU-19 B/B aircraft-launched flare for nighttime illumination of surface areas in search and attack operations.   The LUU-19 B/B is derived from the LUU-2 flare. The two flares are identical in form, fit and function, except the LUU-19 provides a near- infrared illumination requiring night-vision equipment to detect. This enables its use in covert target illumination and rescue operations. The LUU-19 weighs 36 lbs. It consists of four major components: the mechanical timer, the parachute suspension system, the Out-of Line Igniter (OLI), and the case assembly with cast candle. The illuminant candle composition and igniter are proprietary to ATK Launch Systems. The timer consists of a mechanical timer and related hardware enclosed in a lexan plastic housing. The mechanical timer is a verge type, three-gear timer, powered by a torsional mainspring. A phosphorescent plastic decal with calibrated markings to indicate the feet-of-fall prior to parachute deployment and flare functioning is located on the face of the timer cover. The decal has a SAFE position and timer settings from 250 to 11,000 feet-of-fall. Under the pointer portion of the timer knob, and as part of the knob, a flexible arm is located with a detent that will retain the knob in the recess next to the corresponding timer setting. The timer knob has a quick attach-detach spring operated latch which allows the lanyard loop to be connected to the knob. A pawl release mechanism retains the timer assembly in the flare housing. A mechanical destruct feature makes the timer inoperative after it is functioned. The parachute suspension system utilizes an 18-foot diameter cruciform shaped canopy for stability. Two riser cables connect the parachute to a bulkhead separating the parachute compartment from the remainder of the flare assembly. One cable is attached to an explosive bolt for parachute dump at candle burnout. The ignition system utilizes a lanyard that is attached to one of the parachute riser cables. The lanyard is threaded through the bulkhead and past the candle in an internal raceway along the side of the aluminum case leading to the ignition assembly in the ignition housing near the candle's face. The lanyard is attached to a triggering mechanism consisting of the Out-of-Line Igniter (OLI). The pyrotechnic firing train consists of a percussion primer, boron-potassium nitrate pellets, and a propellant wafer.  <br>    <br>  The technical data package (TDP) is classified as DISTRIBUTION D limited distribution. Distribution D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet. The TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240 ET SEQ. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25. Only the top level drawing will be provided for this market survey.  Offerors must be registered with the Joint Certification Program at the following web site: HTTP://WWW.DLIS.DLA.MIL/JCP/DEFAULT.ASP, in order to receive a copy of the top level drawing. After receipt of required certification, the contractor shall request a copy of the drawing via email from Julie.a.coughlin.civ@mail.mil. Request must include: CAGE code, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and point of contact.  <br>    <br>  After receipt and review of the top level drawing, interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability. Please indicate your business size in your response. Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum monthly production quantities.  Additionally, it is requested you provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production. A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in the pyrotechnics industry. A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these items. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate and should describe his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. The estimated quantity for this solicitation is approximately 4,850 ea LUU-19B/B Illumination Flares.  Interested companies should also include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit price for this estimated quantity.  <br>    <br>  Interested parties have 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Any response to this market research should reference the following: LUU-19B/B Illumination Flare solicitation number W52P1J-13-R-0141.

The theme is  quote mark Exploring innovative concepts for partnering with Industry and others in the areas of ground Electronic Warfare (EW), Tactical Cyber, Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) and tactical ground Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. quote mark   Given today's environment of budget cuts and fiscal uncertainty, it is extremely important that Industry and others understand Army priorities, gaps, and where to make strategic investment decisions. PM EW, in conjunction with the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) seek opportunities to help industry focus its Independent Research & Development (IR&D) on technology innovation that will bring maximum benefit to the Army. This collaborative outreach will not only help PM EW leverage Industry's IR&D resources, but Industry and others will benefit when their research and development programs are better matched to meet Army EW mission requirements.   <br>  <br> TIME		AGENDA ITEM <br>  <br> 1300-1310	Welcome & Admin <br> 1310-1330	The State of PM EW  <br> 1330-1400	Multi Intelligence Teams and Army 2020 <br> 1400-1430	The Evolution and Future of Tactical EW <br> 1430-1445   BREAK <br> 1445-1515	Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations in a congested and Contested   Environment <br> 1515-1545	The emerging Army Cyber Acquisition mission <br> 1545-1615   Technology Base Investments & Opportunities <br> 1615-1645   Q&A Panel Discussion <br> 1645-1700   Closing Remarks <br>  <br> Please come join us in what is expected to be an interesting and informative half day session.  We recognize our Collaborative Outreach event on the afternoon of 3 Dec 2013 is scheduled in parallel with the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Advanced Planning Briefing to Industry (APBI) C4ISR Day.  The APBI event was viewed as a target of opportunity when many Industry attendees would be in the APG, MD area, thus minimizing travel time and costs. The intent is to capitalize on this opportunity. It is our hope that the afternoon APBI and Outreach sessions are mutually exclusive, and do not detract or inhibit target Industry audience from attending either event.  We apologize in advance if this is not the case <br>

Firms are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by accessing the website www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/ and looking under Standard Aviation and Missile Source Approval Request (SAMSAR) and looking under Qualification Procedures for Missile Requirements (AMCOM pamphlet 702-1) and Policy Relating to Source Approval Request (SAR) for Missile Requirements.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Drawings, specifications, or other technical data are not available and will not be furnished.

<p>Scope Summary:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a firm fixed-price Design-Build contract for the Building 7 Structural Renovation, located in Auburn, WA pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Best Value Design-Build Selection Procedures (FAR Subpart 15.3).</p>
<p>The design-build scope of work includes all labor and materials required to provide architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to design and upgrade for the modernization of an existing building resulting in a facility compliant with applicable structural code requirements.</p>
<p>Related services include, but are not limited ACM abatement, testing, inspection &amp; monitoring during construction.</p>
<p>The proposed project is a Structural Upgrade of the Auburn Building 7 / SSA in Auburn, WA, to include major structural, seismic and roofing upgrades and window and roof energy efficiency measures. <br /> <br />The site encompasses approximately 169,000 gross square feet of one story space with an additional 36,500 SF of mezzanine space.  Also, a portion of the facility has a structural ceiling support / mechanical access mezzanine.  The occupancy is primarily office, studio and training center spaces for regional and local federal tenant agencies.</p>
<p>A.	Project Identification</p>
<p>Title: 	Building 7 Structural Renovation<br />Location:	Auburn, WA<br />Address:	1901 C Street SW, Auburn, WA, 98001</p>
<p>Building 7 is located at 1901 C Street, Auburn, WA 98001.  The facility was designed and constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943 and was remodeled for the Social Security Administration in 2006.  The building's roof structure primarily consists of wood trusses supported on solid sawn wood columns.  Several roof truss members have been damaged recently, most likely as a result of the heavy snowfall in January 2012.  Subsequent studies have identified significant deficiencies relative to current code requirements for both vertical and lateral building elements.  This project is intended to rectify these issues.</p>
<p>B.	Project Background<br />The roof trusses were constructed with solid sawn green lumber of quality typically used in the 1940s.  Since January 2012, a number of repair projects have been undertaken to mitigate structural damage to the roof trusses.  In addition, the GSA has commissioned studies which identified significant structural deficiencies and potential renovation methods.  The GSA intends to utilize the expertise of the selected D/B Team to upgrade the subject facility to meet IBC Structural Requirements.</p>
<p>This is a modernization project, as further defined in the PBS-P100 Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service.  (See the Standards and Criteria Documents section under General Requirements below.).</p>
<p>1.	Project Objectives<br /><br />a.	Upgrade facility to meet 2012 International Building Code (IBC) vertical load requirements.  Work includes but is not limited to the upgrade of all deficient roof trusses.  The D/B team shall be responsible for the method of upgrade and implementation of same.  In addition, D/B Team shall verify adequacy of columns, walls, foundation elements and other portions of the structural system as appropriate.<br /><br />b.	Upgrade facility to meet current IBC lateral load requirements.  Lateral system work is primarily anticipated to involve the southern &frac12; of the facility but limited work may be required within the northern &frac12;.  Work potentially includes new diaphragm sheathing, new chord ties, new lateral frames and/or shear walls and new or upgraded foundations.  In addition, unreinforced masonry and hollow clay tile walls shall be upgraded, reinforced, braced or replaced with compliant construction.  <br /><br />c.	Re-roof entire facility and install 20 year warranty roof membrane with minimum R30 roof insulation.<br /><br />d.	Protect and/or remove and re-install all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire sprinkler and other systems to "before project" condition.  Systems in northern &frac12; of facility (SSA Teleservice Center) shall remain fully operational throughout the project.<br /><br />e.	Protect government property from damage during repair work and maintain clean project area free of excessive dust, debris and odors.  Note that studio equipment in Bay 3 is high value and extra effort to protect this equipment should be anticipated and included.<br /><br />f.	Re-clad the southern &frac12; of the facility to match exterior cladding on northern &frac12; installed as a part of the 2004 SSA Teleservice Center upgrade project.  Add insulation to exterior closure to meet GSA Energy Guidelines.<br /><br />g.	Complete work within the Government's budget and according to the proposed project schedule.<br /><br />h.	Update facility BIM to document changes to structure and illustrate work completed under this contract.  Modify BIM model as necessary to comply with GSA BIM Standards and COBie requirements.  Provide as-built BIM at project closeout along with PDF version of as-built construction documents.<br /><br />i.	North &frac12; of Building - SSA Teleservice Center SSA will continue to occupy the Teleservice Center during construction.  Therefore the upgrade method proposed will need to be a method that minimizes disturbance. Work within this area must be accomplished outside of SSA's operating hours which are, typically, 6:00 am through 7:00 pm Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays.  The Northern &frac12; of the facility is compliant with current IBC lateral force requirements so it is anticipated that vertical force requirements will be the predominate effort.  However, the contractor shall verify the adequacy of the lateral force system and perform upgrades as needed for code compliance.&nbsp;<br /><br />j.	South &frac12; of Building - SSA Training Center &amp; Vacated VBA Space.  In order for the south &frac12; of the building to become code compliant, it is necessary to perform a lateral system upgrade along with the vertical truss upgrade.  In addition, since the VBA space is vacant and the Training Center is able to be unoccupied during construction, a different vertical upgrade method is proposed for this space.  It will be necessary to add lateral and longitudinal shear walls or other lateral system elements to this area to bring the lateral system into code compliance.  Provide additional structural upgrades to meet or exceed current IBC requirements. The mechanical access mezzanine is deficient and requires upgrading to meet vertical and lateral code requirements.<br /><br />No assumption of existing code compliance shall be assumed and must be verified by the design-builder.</p>
<p>2.	Project Delivery Approach<br /><br />GSA envisions a highly collaborative design build delivery approach for this project.  The expectation is that the DB contractor will work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a project that meets the expectations and needs of team members and GSA's requirements for a structurally compliant facility.   The DB team will be selected through a best value / tradeoff selection process.  During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders and the CMa to ensure that all of the goals are addressed and that best value practices are utilized.</p>
<p>3.	Contracting Method<br /><br />We are proposing to perform the Project utilizing a Design / Build (D/B) Performance Based approach.  The goal of the project will be for the building to comply with the 2012 International Building code as adopted by the City of Auburn at substantial completion</p>

The facility encompasses approximately 169,000 gross square feet of one story space with an additional 36,500 SF of mezzanine space.  Also, a portion of the facility has a structural ceiling support / mechanical access mezzanine.  The occupancy is primarily office, studio and training center spaces for regional and local federal tenant agencies.</p>
<p>This is a modernization project, as further defined in the PBS-P100 Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service.</p>
<p>2.	Project Objectives<br />a.	Upgrade timber roof trusses to meet current International Building Code (IBC) vertical load requirements as adopted by the City of Auburn.  Work includes but is not limited to the upgrade of all deficient roof trusses.  The D/B team shall be responsible for the method of upgrade and implementation of same.</p>
<p>b.	 Upgrade facility to meet current IBC lateral load requirements.  Lateral system work is primarily anticipated to involve the southern &frac12; of the facility but some work may be required within the northern &frac12;.  Work potentially includes new diaphragm sheathing, new chord ties, new lateral frames and/or shear walls and new or upgraded foundations.  In addition, unreinforced masonry and hollow clay tile walls shall be investigated and, if necessary, upgraded, reinforced, braced or replaced with compliant construction.  The D/B team shall be responsible for the method of upgrade and implementation of same.</p>
<p>c.	Protect and/or remove and re-install all mechanical, electrical, lighting, plumbing, fire sprinkler and other systems to "before project" condition as necessary to perform the work.  Systems in northern 3/4 of facility (SSA Teleservice Center) shall remain fully operational throughout the project.  Systems in southernmost &frac14; of the facility may be temporarily disconnected if necessary to perform contractor's work.</p>
<p>d.	Protect and/or remove and re-install all architectural improvements throughout the facility to before project conditions as necessary to perform the work.</p>
<p>e.	Protect government property from damage during repair work and maintain clean project area free of excessive dust, debris and odors.  Note that studio equipment in Bay 3 is high value and extra effort to protect this equipment should be anticipated and included.</p>
<p>f.	Complete work within the Government's budget and according to the proposed project schedule (attached).</p>
<p>g.	Update facility BIM to document changes to structure and illustrate work completed under this contract.  Provide as-built BIM at project closeout along with PDF version of as-built construction documents.</p>
<p>h.	North &frac12; of Building (Bays 1 and 2) - SSA Teleservice Center SSA will continue to occupy the Teleservice Center during construction.  Therefore the upgrade method proposed will need to be a method that minimizes disturbance.  Work within this area must be accomplished outside of SSA's operating hours which are, typically, 6:00 am through 7:00 pm Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays.</p>
<p>i.	South &frac12; of Building (Bays 3 and 4) - SSA Training Center and Studio (Bay 3) &amp; Vacant, former VBA Space (Bay 4).  Work within these spaces may be performed during normal working hours provided that contractor shall coordinate operations with Training Center and Studio operations to minimize disturbance to tenants.</p>
<p>3.	Project Delivery Approach<br />GSA envisions a highly collaborative design build delivery approach for this project.  The expectation is that the DB contractor will work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a project that meets the expectations and needs of team members and GSA's requirements for a structurally compliant facility.   The DB team will be selected through a best value / trade-off selection process.  During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders and the CMA to ensure that all of the goals are addressed and that best value practices are utilized.</p>
<p>4.	Contracting Method<br />We are proposing to perform the Project utilizing a Design / Build (D/B) Performance Based approach.  The goal of the project will be for the building to comply with the current International Building code as adopted by the City of Auburn at substantial completion.</p>
<p>B.	Project Identification</p>
<p>Title: 	Building 7 Structural Rehabilitation<br />Location:	Auburn, WA<br />Address:	1901 C Street SW, Auburn, WA, 98001</p>
<p>Building 7 is located at 1901 C Street, Auburn, WA 98001.  The facility was designed and constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943 and was remodeled for the Social Security Administration in 2006.  The building's roof structure primarily consists of wood trusses supported on solid sawn wood columns.  Several roof truss members have been damaged recently as a result of the heavy snowfall in January 2012 combined with advanced age and functional obsolescence.  Subsequent studies have identified significant deficiencies relative to current code requirements for both vertical and lateral building elements.  This project is intended to rectify these issues.</p>
<p>C.	Project Background<br />Building 7 was originally constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943.  The roof trusses were constructed with solid sawn green lumber of quality typically used in the 1940s.  Connection forces between truss members are transferred through the use of split ring connectors.</p>
<p>Since January 2012, a number of repair projects have been undertaken to mitigate structural damage to the roof trusses and truss connections in this building as well as in other buildings in the complex.</p>
<p>In addition, the GSA has commissioned studies which identified significant structural deficiencies and potential renovation methods.  The GSA intends to utilize the expertise of the selected D/B Team to upgrade the subject facility's roof trusses to meet current IBC Structural Requirements.<br />&nbsp;<br />Authorized Representatives</p>

<p>B.	Project Identification</p>
<p>Title: 	Building 7 Structural Rehabilitation<br />Location:	Auburn, WA<br />Address:	1901 C Street SW, Auburn, WA, 98001</p>
<p>Building 7 is located at 1901 C Street, Auburn, WA 98001.  The facility was designed and constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943 and was remodeled for the Social Security Administration in 2006.  The building's roof structure primarily consists of wood trusses supported on solid sawn wood columns.  Several roof truss members have been damaged recently as a result of the heavy snowfall in January 2012 combined with advanced age and functional obsolescence.  Subsequent studies have identified significant deficiencies relative to current code requirements for both vertical and lateral building elements.  This project is intended to rectify these issues.</p>
<p>C.	Project Background<br />Building 7 was originally constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943.  The roof trusses were constructed with solid sawn green lumber of quality typically used in the 1940s.  Connection forces between truss members are transferred through the use of split ring connectors.</p>
<p>Since January 2012, a number of repair projects have been undertaken to mitigate structural damage to the roof trusses and truss connections in this building as well as in other buildings in the complex.</p>
<p>In addition, the GSA has commissioned studies which identified significant structural deficiencies and potential renovation methods.  The GSA intends to utilize the expertise of the selected D/B Team to upgrade the subject facility's roof trusses to meet current IBC Structural Requirements.<br />&nbsp;<br />Authorized Representatives</p>

The expectation is that the DB contractor will work closely with all stakeholders to deliver a project that meets the expectations and needs of team members and GSA's requirements for a structurally compliant facility.   The DB team will be selected through a best value / trade-off selection process.  During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders and the CMA to ensure that all of the goals are addressed and that best value practices are utilized.</p>
<p>4.	Contracting Method<br />We are proposing to perform the Project utilizing a Design / Build (D/B) Performance Based approach.  The goal of the project will be for the building to comply with the current International Building code as adopted by the City of Auburn at substantial completion.</p>
<p>B.	Project Identification</p>
<p>Title: 	Building 7 Structural Rehabilitation<br />Location:	Auburn, WA<br />Address:	1901 C Street SW, Auburn, WA, 98001</p>
<p>Building 7 is located at 1901 C Street, Auburn, WA 98001.  The facility was designed and constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943 and was remodeled for the Social Security Administration in 2006.  The building's roof structure primarily consists of wood trusses supported on solid sawn wood columns.  Several roof truss members have been damaged recently as a result of the heavy snowfall in January 2012 combined with advanced age and functional obsolescence.  Subsequent studies have identified significant deficiencies relative to current code requirements for both vertical and lateral building elements.  This project is intended to rectify these issues.</p>
<p>C.	Project Background<br />Building 7 was originally constructed by the US Army Corp of Engineers in 1943.  The roof trusses were constructed with solid sawn green lumber of quality typically used in the 1940s.  Connection forces between truss members are transferred through the use of split ring connectors.</p>
<p>Since January 2012, a number of repair projects have been undertaken to mitigate structural damage to the roof trusses and truss connections in this building as well as in other buildings in the complex.</p>
<p>In addition, the GSA has commissioned studies which identified significant structural deficiencies and potential renovation methods.  The GSA intends to utilize the expertise of the selected D/B Team to upgrade the subject facility's roof trusses to meet current IBC Structural Requirements.<br />&nbsp;<br />Authorized Representatives</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Repairs to the South Jetty at Newburyport Harbor - Newburyport, MA.  The estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  <br>    <br> Proposed work consists of repairing portions of the 1,400-foot-long jetty that was damaged during Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Sandy.  Approximately 12,000 tons of 6 to 12 ton armor stone will be required.  Crest width is 15 feet.  Crest elevation at the most seaward end is +12 feet mean lower low water (MLLW).  Side slopes are 1 vertical : 1 horizontal on the river side and 2 horizontal : 1 vertical on the ocean side.  The work includes replacing displaced core and armor stone to fill in existing gaps in the jetty.  Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement.  Repairs were begun on the first 600 feet of the jetty during the winter of 2012-2013 and will need to be finished under this contract.  About 6 days per month during the construction window, seas can be expected to be in excess of 8 feet in the river mouth. Equipment and stone delivery and access to the jetty may be performed from land, water or a combination.  Protection of piping plovers and their habitat limits any work by land from 01-SEP to 31-MAR.  If accessing by land, the expected storage / staging area for the stone, equipment and trailer is at the paved Newburyport parking lot, at the northern end of Northern Boulevard on Plum Island; access to the parking lot will be along Northern Boulevard in Newbury and Newburyport.  There may be restrictions on load limits and daily truck deliveries through Newburyport.  It is about 2,600 feet from the parking lot to the jetty.  It's expected that trucks will transport the stone from the parking lot to the jetty over mats over the vegetated dunes.  Northern Boulevard, the parking lot, dunes, and any excess vegetation damaged will be restored to their pre-construction condition.  About 5,200 feet of sand fencing will be installed along the access/haul route after construction, or by 31-MAR.

<DESC>Repairs to the South Jetty at Newburyport Harbor - Newburyport, MA. Work consists of repairing portions of the 1,400-foot-long jetty that was damaged during Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Sandy. Approximately 12,000 tons of 6 to 12 ton armor stone will be required. Crest width is 15 feet. Crest elevation at the most seaward end is +12 feet mean lower low water (MLLW). Side slopes are 1 vertical : 1 horizontal on the river side and 2 horizontal : 1 vertical on the ocean side. The work includes replacing displaced core and armor stone to fill in existing gaps in the jetty. Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement. Repairs were begun on the first 600 feet of the jetty during the winter of 2012-2013 and will need to be finished under this contract. About 6 days per month during the construction window, seas can be expected to be in excess of 8 feet in the river mouth. Equipment and stone delivery and access to the jetty may be performed from land, water or a combination. Protection of piping plovers and their habitat limits any work by land from 01-SEP to 31-MAR. If accessing by land, the expected storage / staging area for the stone, equipment and trailer is at the paved Newburyport parking lot, at the northern end of Northern Boulevard on Plum Island; access to the parking lot will be along Northern Boulevard in Newbury and Newburyport. There may be restrictions on load limits and daily truck deliveries through Newburyport. It is about 2,600 feet from the parking lot to the jetty. It's expected that trucks will transport the stone from the parking lot to the jetty over mats over the vegetated dunes. Northern Boulevard, the parking lot, dunes, and any excess vegetation damaged will be restored to their pre-construction condition. About 5,200 feet of sand fencing will be installed along the access/haul route after construction, or by 31-MAR.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition; THIS IS A NOTICE, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 5.201 and 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action. This is a notice of intent to extend the services provided under NIEHS Contract HHSN273200800010I. This is not a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and delays in service make competition not feasible for the extension. The NIEHS intends to issue a sole-source, modification to extend subject contracts' period of performance from 1 January 2014 up to 31 March 2014,. This extension will provide the NIEHS with continued support for no more than three months beyond the current end date of 31 December 2013. These Multi-Media Services are anticipated to be re-competed and awarded on or before 01 April 2014.
