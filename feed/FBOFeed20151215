Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Current qualified sources are:  MOOG INC (Cage: 94697), Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302.  
All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8129.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<p>Configuration Change Management - Engineering Change Proposal, Requests for Variance (Deviation or Waiver) February 2015<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Requirements<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Configuration Change Management section of SAE EIA-649-1 Configuration Management Requirement for Defense Contracts, Paragraph 3.3, shall be used for Configuration Control of material purchased under this contract.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Furnished item(s) shall conform to the approved configuration requirements/revision specified, unless a Pre-Production Request for Variance (deviation) or a Post-Production Request for Variance (waiver) is processed and approved as provided by Paragraph 3 in this Standard Text Object (STO). Hereafter, the term Request for Variance (RFV) will also include Requests for Deviations and Waivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use "as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Contractor responsibilities.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Refer to FAR Part 48 Value Engineering for cost saving improvements to the Technical Data Package (TDP).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. All ECPs submitted by the Contractor will be deemed routine. If the Contractor considers an ECP as an emergency or urgent; they shall include in their ECP submittal an explanation and all applicable supporting documentation. All ECPs will be reviewed for a determination on criticality, and, if concurred to be an emergency, the appropriate processing time-frame negotiated with the ESAs will be followed and the Contractor will be notified of anticipated response time.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. For ECPs, Specification Change Notices (SCNs) or RFV, the Contractor must submit the applicable documentation listed in sub-paragraphs D (1) through D (4) to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), with an information copy to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). Failure to submit a complete legible package may result in return of the ECP/RFV without processing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Documentation listed in Paragraph 3.3.1 (for ECPs), 3.3.2 (RFV), 3.3.3 (for SCNs) or 3.3.4 (for Notices of Revision (NORs)) of the latest revision of EIA-649-1.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) DD Form 1692 (current revision) for ECP.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) DD Form 1694 (current revision) for RFV.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) DD Form 1695 (current revision) for NOR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. DLA#s responsibilities:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Upon receipt of the ECP or RFV, the PCO will ensure that the applicable product specialist receives the copy from DCMA.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Within five (5) working days from the date of receipt of the Contractor's ECP or RFV from DCMA, the PS must submit the requests and any supporting documentation via a 339 to the appropriate Engineering Support Activity (ESA), when applicable.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Routine ECPs will be processed within 90 days from receipt by the ESA. RFVs will be evaluated and processed within 30 days from receipt by the ESA or as negotiated with the ESA.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The contractor will be notified in writing of approval by the return of an approved copy of the ECP or RFV.&nbsp; Approval will be reflected by signature of the contracting activity or a review activity specifically identified in the contract.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The contractor will be notified in writing of disapproval including reason(s) for disapproval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. For an approved RFV or an approved ECP, when the request affects the Contract, a modification will be issued to the contract incorporating the applicable requirement changes. Only a Contracting Officer is authorized to issue a modification incorporating the approved RFV and/or ECP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Questions regarding the status of previously submitted ECP or RFV should be directed to the PCO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The submission of an ECP or RFV by the Contractor does not affect the required delivery date of the contract.&nbsp; If a delivery date change is needed, it must be negotiated with the Contracting Officer and documented via modification to the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The period of time for evaluation and approval/disapproval of an ECP and/or a RFV, as specified in Paragraph 4. C., shall not constitute excusable delay in the performance of this Contract by the Contractor or in any way relieve the contractor from compliance with the contract delivery schedule.&nbsp; The submission of an ECP and/or RFV by the Contractor shall not preclude the Government from exercising its rights under any clause of the Contract.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 

Aircraft Fuel Cell and Safety Management Systems

1.	Background
  
The aviation industry has been studying, performing tests and developing prototypes to support several applications of fuel cells Solid Oxide(SOFC), Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEMFC)and Regenerative Fuel Cells on airplanes. Some applications that have been discussed during industry meetings are as follows:

a. Use the electrical energy to replace an airplane's main battery, ram air turbine and auxiliary power unit;
b. Power equipment such as galley cookers, chillers, coffee makers, in-flight entertainment systems, cargo unit load devices and medical equipment; and
c. Use the water produced as a byproduct to reduce the need for water refilling trucks and ground support equipment. 
d. Increased efficiency of the aircraft by reducing the overall weight of the aircraft as far less water has to be carried onboard for toilets and other uses.

Major aircraft manufacturers are evaluating the use of hydrogen fuels cells for electric power generation on existing and new aircraft models to reduce weight, improve efficiency, and reduce their environmental footprint. Carrying hydrogen on-board an airplane creates safety issues that need to be understood and carefully addressed. For example, hydrogen is highly combustible and, due to its small molecular size, commonly leaks. 
Current regulations and known means of compliance do not include this new and novel technology.  . The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs this information and data to support the development of appropriate rules and guidance that will ensure integrity of electrical systems and safety of aircraft equipped with fuel cells. This research will search, test, and develop data and recommendations for FAA and global partners to support appropriate standards, regulations, and means of demonstrating safe compliance.

2.	Purpose
The purpose of this BAA is to study and develop fuel cell technology for safe, certifiable installations on aircraft. This research should consider the following applications but it is not limited to this list: 
Emergency Electrical Power Generation
Backup power 
On board water generation 
Cargo compartment fire suppression
Combined heat and electrical power 
Anti-icing applications 
Fuel tank inerting applications
Primary propulsion for light propeller airplanes

For these and any application of SOFC , PEMFC or regenerative fuel cells stack failure hazard should be defined and quantified for the application. Also how the technology will interface with the aircraft systems should be detailed. When this technology is applied to emergency power, ramp up performance should be defined under loaded condition along with all operational procedures.
 
The goal of this research is:

	Assess current FAA, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations concerning the installation of this technology onboard aircraft
	Determine characteristics of what constitutes a safe fuel cell system installation, operation, monitoring, control and maintenance.
	Identify any maintenance action or reliability issues to be include in the Instructions for continued airworthiness
	Safely managing fueling and servicing hydrogen and other fuel sources  
	Identify and assess the technical and operational risks associated with the technology and the mitigating factors that may be used to retain the same or increased level of safety as enjoyed today with conventional power systems.

 The program will ultimately include an implementation plan of these guidelines into a standard or specification using any accepted aviation governing bodies such as Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 

3.	Submission Deadlines
Technical summary proposals (see section 4) prepared in accordance with this synopsis will be accepted through TBD or until fiscal year 2016 funding for this effort is committed, whichever occurs first.

<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Architecture Concept Study: <p> NASA invites industry to participate in the definition and analysis of the Nations future space communications and navigation architecture with a focus on the Earth and Mars space relay capabilities. This future system capability will provide the next generation space and ground infrastructure to enhance space exploration and return critical science and exploration data to investigators on Earth from all regions of the solar system. The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Office at NASA leads the architecture study and manages and operates NASAs critical communications and navigation system infrastructure. This study will define a top-level end-to-end next generation (Next Gen) architecture concept that evolves NASAs space communications and navigation networks consisting of NASA, commercial industry, other government agencies, and international space agencies assets and other supporting systems. Next Gen is broadly defined over the next 25 years to the 2040 timeframe and more specifically defined over the next 10 years to the 2025 time frame when initial Next Gen capabilities will start to become operational. <p> NASA offers a range of world class space communications and navigation services and capabilities to enable the next generation of science and exploration missions and global collaborations.  These services and capabilities (e.g. forward and return communications, tracking, navigation aids, internetworking, and timing references) allow missions to share the costs of critical, space and ground infrastructure and eliminate individual and costly mission-specific facilities thus providing a cost effective, national resource for space exploration. <p> In the coming decade, NASA will look to sustain and enhance its space and ground infrastructure to adjust and respond to the changing needs of science missions and plans for future human exploration of the solar system.  The Next Gen relay architecture study will provide a detailed analysis of capability proposed for the future network.  A four-month study is envisioned to: 	apply the needs of NASAs mission use cases against proposed elements of the future architecture; 	conduct simulations and trades for the proposed implementation of architecture features; 	define specific relay, tracking, and internetworking capabilities for near Earth (up to 2 million kilometers) and/or Mars spacecraft; and 	provide cost estimates of developing, deploying, operating, maintaining and sustaining the proposed new space relay capabilities over a 20 year window. <p> The vision for the future network will connect investigators more closely with their scientific instrumentation, reduce both user mission spacecraft and infrastructure burden (resources and cost), apply appropriate aspects of terrestrial communication technologies, enable greater availability and leverage commercial innovations and capabilities and international partnerships. <p> The study consists of four tasks: 	Develop the architecture for  future relay capabilities in the Near Earth and/or deep space regions 	Conduct trade studies, modeling and simulation, analysis of future relay capabilities and identify enabling technologies 	Define and infuse specific near Earth and/or Mars relay elements and their capabilities 	Develop cost and schedule estimates for future near Earth and/or Mars relay elements <p> During the course of the study, it will be important to provide a basis for proposed new capabilities via properly analyzed trades, analyses and operational scenarios. The study effort will emphasize the trades and analyses conducted and will be used as justification and supporting rationale for the proposed architecture elements for the entire set of SCaN networks focusing on near Earth and Mars relays elements. Models and simulations developed during this study may be used to explore specific relay elements or capabilities in more detail during follow-on design and implementation efforts. Offerors will be asked to consider best commercial practices and standards, emerging technologies, and compare the current and anticipated capabilities and technologies available to implement each architecture feature below within the near Earth and Mars network architecture.  Recommendations will be based upon simulation results or through trade studies with proper rationale. <p> The study will focus on trades associated with the following architecture features: <p> Relay Capability  integrated functionality relay satellites or disaggregated functionality across a collection of dissimilar satellites providing communications, navigation, and internetworking capabilities <p> Direct to Ground  where/when direct to ground services have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage over relays <p> Spacecraft burden  shared burden (e.g. mass, power, volume, operational complexity) between relay infrastructure and mission spacecraft to increase performance and reduce overall cost <p> Multiple Access  where/when multiple access techniques (e.g. TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, OFDMA, spatial diversity, others) should be used on forward/return links from/to relays in order to simultaneously support the needs of multiple mission spacecraft within the full field of regard <p> Optical Communications  where/when optical links have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage <p> RF Communications  where/when RF links have technical, operational, and/or cost advantage <p> Government ownership and operations  requirements and mission aspects requiring NASA owned or operated assets <p> Commercial Service and operations  mission/infrastructure aspects potentially met by commercial services Internetworking  benefits and burden of providing link layer (2) and network layer (3) services <p> Security  role, approach, benefits, and risks of secure command, telemetry, and science data links <p> Timing and Frequency Standards  common time standards, radiometrics and other navigation aids <p> User Service Requests  means and capacity to support automated requests for communication and navigation services on-demand as well as near term scheduled service <p> Autonomy  where/when in the network autonomy has technical, operational, and/or cost advantage <p> Cognition  adaptive or cognitive communications and networking to improve efficiency <p> Commonality  across elements of near Earth and Mars relays that reduce development or operations costs <p> Deployment of Relay Elements  Launch methods (e.g. primary payload, secondary/ride share, hosted payloads), launch vehicle configuration, number of launches, and cost <p> The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about January 14, 2016 with an anticipated proposal due date on or about February 15, 2016. <p> It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). <p> Please send questions regarding the Synopsis or the Industry Briefing to: <a href="mailto:SCaN-NextGen-Architecture@mail.nasa.gov">SCaN-NextGen-Architecture@mail.nasa .gov </a> <p> INDUSTRY BRIEFING Interested parties are invited to attend an industry briefing at NASA Headquarters Auditorium January 21, 2016, at 300 East Street SW, Room 1G60, Washington DC, 20546.

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.
<p><br />The NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) is responsible for the administration, coordination, and scientific review of most of the extramural clinical trials supported by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD). These programs include the activities of the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Many of these trials require scientific review, input and coordination with other DCTD programs (e.g. Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) and Cancer Imaging Program (CIP)) and NCI programs such as NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP).</p>
<p>CTEP continues to implement recommendations made by the Clinical Trials Working Group (CTWG) of the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on restructuring the NCI's clinical trials enterprise to realize the promise of molecular oncology in the 21st century.  NCI's Coordinating Center for Clinical Trials (CCCT) guides and facilitates the implementation of the CTWG recommendations. CTEP and the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) collaborate with CCCT in the operations of Scientific Steering Committees (SSCs). The SSCs function to enhance scientific quality and prioritization of NCTN clinical trials and DCP's NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) symptom management, cancer control and cancer care delivery studies.</p>
<p>NCI also supports several precision medicine studies that are developed and implemented nationally and include collaborations with CDP, Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) and other NCI Divisions and Centers to conduct these studies, including but not limited to the Exceptional Responders study, Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH), Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trials (ALCHEMIST), and LUNG-Map.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a Contractor to provide direct organizational and information management support for these clinical trials programs and to provide support to the CTEP and DCTD Professional Staff in the acquisition, review and analysis of data to assist in the development, planning and conduct of new clinical trials and information which results from completed extramural research.</p>
<p>The work is divided into five major Sections. Organizations will be required to:</p>
<p>I.	Contract Transition (Phase-In)</p>
<p>II.	Clinical Trials Information Support <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide support to the NCI Professional Staff in the acquisition of information and analysis of data to support developing new studies. These contract staff, referred to as Information Specialists, will also assist in analysis of data that result from clinical research and other program analyses needed. The data for possible analyses has had the personal identifying information (PII) removed by the NCI grantees prior to data submission to the NCI as part of their standard procedures. Many of these activities support NCI's mission of evaluating, prioritizing, coordinating, and analyzing planned and ongoing clinical trials and clinical research through mechanisms such as concept evaluations, scientific strategy and program meetings, clinical trial planning meetings, and special drug development meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.	   Clinical Trials Project Management<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide clinical trials project management support across four-sub-task areas.  These contract staff, referred to as Clinical Trials Project Managers (PMs), shall work collaboratively with NCI Professional Staff to:</p>
<p>A.	Coordinate, Track and Support Accrual to CTEP-Sponsored Trials from Activation to Completion<br />B.	Provide Project Management Support and Coordination to DCTD Correlative Science    Studies (CSS)<br />C.	Provide Project Management to NCI Precision Medicine Trials<br />D.	Provide Project Management support to NCI's Early Drug Development Project Teams (PT)</p>
<p>IV.	CCCT Scientific, Administrative and Logistical Meeting Support<br />Scientific, administrative, and logistical support for CCCT is broken into four task areas: <br /> <br />A.	Scientific Steering Committee Support<br />B.	Task Force Support<br />C.	Working Group (Ad-hoc) Support<br />D.	Additional Administrative Support for Related Activities</p>
<p>V.	Options<br /><br />A.	Increased Capacity<br />B.	Phase-Out Transition</p>
<p>The NCI seeks continuation of services to be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, completion-type contract with a base period of one (1) year, four (4) one year option periods and five (5) Increased Capacity Options may be awarded beginning on or about May 1, 2016.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

System Support intends to solicit and negotiate with only the approved
Government sources for REPAIR of the following: Electronic Components P/N:
428-01784-002 NSN: 5998-01-573-2924 Quantity: 1/ea All responsible sources may
identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit
proposals, quotations or capability statements. This part requires engineering
source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality
of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and
manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the
part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights,
manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available
to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the
quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the
design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government
engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the
Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the
intended application. The subject items require Government source approval prior
to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data
available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open
competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for repair
of these items is being solicited. However, all responsible sources may submit a
capability statement, prop osal or quotation, which shall be considered by the
agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this
synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government
not to compete this contract action based upon responses to this notice is
solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will
normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct
a competitive procurement. The time required for approval of a new source is
normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal,
the information detailed in the NAVSUP Source Approval Information Brochure for
Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based
on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This
brochure can be obtained at "https://ww
w.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps" or by e-mailing the
NAVSUP Buyer. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated
at NAVSUP, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your
request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all
data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award
under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request
submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements
preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government
requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet
support needs. For any questions concerning this notice, contact the Buyer,
Rachel Sprinkle at Rachel.sprinkle@navy.mil.

1.	SCHEDULE OF SERVICES AND/OR SUPPLIES.
	 	 	 
	Products 
Item #	Description/Part Number*	Est. Qty	Unit Price	Estimated Amount
0001 	Purchase of Allopurinol, USP	175 Kgs		

2.	CONTRACT TITLE.
Purchase of allopurinol, USP

3.	BACKGROUND.
The VACSPCRPCC must purchase allopurinol, USP Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (Allopurinol API) to manufacture 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg allopurinol tablets (Product) for VA research clinical trial CSP594 to study the use of allopurinol and febuxostat in veterans suffering from gout.  This new VACSPCRPCC clinical trial that is expected to provide patients with allopurinol tablets for approximately 4 years.

4.	SCOPE.
This is a contract for the purchase of Allopurinol API which will be used to manufacture Product for VA research clinical trial CSP594. The amount of Allopurinol API to be purchased will be 175Kgs indicated under item number 1, Schedule of Services and/or Supplies.  There is a potential the VA will not purchase product all four years if the clinical study is stopped or does not enroll patients as expected. 

Because each vendor's product has different physical characteristics which impact how we manufacture the product in addition to characteristics of the finished tablets, we must use the same vendor for the life of the study.  The Vendor must be able to provide Allopurinol in similar quantities, if needed, in future years. Switching Allopurinol API vendors in the middle of the study will require extensive additional costs that have not been budgeted for items such as revising regulatory submissions to the Food and Drug Administration, reformulating the product because it has different physical characteristics, additional stability testing, etc.

Time is of the essence for the purchase of the Allopurinol API. Because of the tight schedule to ship product to the clinical sites in May 2016 the Government cannot afford to slip anywhere in the schedule.  

The Allopurinol API manufacturer must hold a Drug Master File (DMF) with the Food and Drug Administration.  A DMF describes to the FDA the manufacturing processes and quality systems the vendor uses to manufacture the Allopurinol API.  There are many vendors of Allopurinol API that do not have DMFs with the FDA.  We can only purchase from the vendors that hold and FDA DMF for quality and safety reasons.  Holding a DMF with the FDA provides the first layer of assurance that we will provide our veterans with tablets that meet our quality expectations and requirements.  The Government is prohibited by law from buying commercial tablets and capsules manufactured in India or China, we also cannot buy active ingredient manufactured in India or China.  

Thus this is a Brand Name Acquisition for Allopurinal API.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for the selection of a quality Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) contractor for the Fa&ccedil;ade-Garage Project at the Richard H. Poff Federal Building, located in Roanoke, VA.
<p><br />This project will utilize the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) project delivery method.</p>
<p>The Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) project delivery method is sometimes also known as the Construction Manager at-Risk project delivery method.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates the use of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) with Construction Contingency Allowance and Shared Savings contract.</p>
<p>The project includes requirements for Design Phase Services and the option(s) for Construction Services at a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).</p>
<p>The Richard H. Poff Federal Building was constructed in 1974. This steel framed, high rise building with masonry fa&ccedil;ade and glass curtain walls contains 254,671 rentable square feet over 14 floors. The Poff building has 341,289 GSF. The building houses 750 employees, has 75 inside parking spaces, and 114 outdoor spaces. The Poff building is primarily general office space, with 4 courtrooms and some specialized law enforcement space.</p>
<p>The overall project objectives include:</p>
<p>&bull;	Remove all existing brick from the building<br />&bull;	Install new brick on east, west, and wing walls<br />&bull;	Resurfacing of the garage upper deck<br />&bull;	Repair of spalled and deteriorated concrete<br />&bull;	Installation of Perimeter Security including but not limited to vehicle barriers, access gates, and fencing.<br />&bull;	Phasing plan to minimize impact to building tenants<br />&bull;	Maintain daily operations and security of the building</p>
<p>The brick replacement will involve the demolition of all brick on the east wall and four (4) wing walls, and installation of new brick on the east wall, west wall, and four (4) wing walls. The project will be phased in such a way to minimize overall tenant impact. The garage repairs will involve removal of the asphalt paving overlay, removal of the deteriorated surface of the structural slab and overlaying with concrete sloped toward the existing deck drains and removal of spalled and deteriorated concrete on the underside of the structural slab, beams, girders and columns and repairing with an appropriate repair material. The perimeter security work involves bringing the site up to current Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Standards. This will be done by installing vehicle barriers, access gates, fencing, and other physical security measures.<br />This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.<br />The NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Code for this procurement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction). The annual small business size standard is $36.5 million.</p>
<p>The estimated price range for the Project is between $10,000,000.00 and $15,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The approach to source selection for this procurement will be pursuant to the best value tradeoff concept as identified in FAR Part 15.101-1 and FAR Part 15.3. Award may be made without discussions. It is the government's intention to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the RFP requirements and is considered to be most advantageous to the government, price and technical factors considered.  Competitive proposals shall be evaluated and assessed based on the factors specified in this solicitation.  For this solicitation, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.</p>
<p>A Pre-proposal conference will be held at the Poff Federal Building on or about January 20, 2016 at 10:00am, local Roanoke time.</p>

<DESC>Convert Electrical Circuit 6 from OH to UG<br />Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, TEXAS<br /><br />WORK TYPE: DESIGN-BUILD / CONSTRUCTION
<p>Provide all site investigations, workplans, site surveys, studies and design analysis, design drawings and specifications, construction documents, shop and manufacturing drawings, materials, labor, equipment, supervision, testing, submittals, and construction to<br />perform the requirements of this project to make the necessary repairs and rehabilitation services in accordance with the provided scope of work and contract documents. The prime contractor shall be required to coordinate with Government Representatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, under the direction of the Contracting Officer (KO) and assigned representatives of the contract. Construction shall commence under the direction of the KO after the work plan(s) and associated shop drawings are completed,<br />reviewed, and approved in writing that the workplan(s) and shop drawings have demonstrated they meet the contract requirements. The intent of the project is to replace a section of the Sheppard Air Force Base (AFB)<br />15kV class electrical distribution system (specifically all of Circuit 6). This work includes conversion of overhead (OH) to underground (UG) and replacement of UG electrical primary and secondary service. The finished system shall be 500 kcmil service. Provide the new UG feeder and taps before removing the existing OH and UG feeder and taps to minimize (to the maximum extent possible) the outage(s) associated with replacing Circuit<br />6. Construct the new UG feeder primary and secondary to include street and parking lot lighting. Demolish the existing OH and UG. Existing ground transformers will be replaced as well as main circuit breakers and switches. Work will also require provision of spare underground ducts and provision for metering. Underground road boring with steel casings is required, but pavement cutting will be considered for government approval in specific<br />situations. The design phase shall determine the best method of accomplishing the replacement of this feeder which consists of approximately 3 miles of OH distribution and approximately 3.6 miles of UG distribution. Both the design and the construction shall be handled under the auspices of one prime contractor that shall be responsible for completing the work. It is the prime contractor's option to subcontract the design and/or construction phase as long as the design is<br />stamped by a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) experienced in &lsquo;15kV Class Distribution System' design and the construction is accomplished by a contractor experienced in &lsquo;15kV Class Line Construction' work. The PE that stamps the design shall be the Designer of<br />Record (DOR). The DOR shall submit his or her design experience for evaluation and shall have a minimum of 5 documented &lsquo;15kV Class Distribution System Modification' projects of similar scope (of which 3 must be designed within the last 5 years). The construction contractor shall submit its construction experience for evaluation and shall have a minimum of 5 years documented &lsquo;15kV Class Line Construction' experience of similar scope (of<br />which 3 must be successfully completed within the last 5 years).<br />The replacement of Circuit 6 shall be accomplished with a minimum of power outage(s). To assist in achieving that requirement, the new UG distribution must be constructed and tested to the maximum extent possible prior to demolishing the existing OH and UG distribution. All outages shall be coordinated with the Contracting Officer (KO) in advance and shall be scheduled through the Sheppard AFB Base Civil Engineer (BCE).<br />The principal elements of the project are:<br />1. Perform required site visit(s) to verify work required according to the documents provided<br />2. Design and Workplan developments<br />3. Construction Management<br />4. Overhead Electrical Distribution Demolition<br />5. Underground Electrical Distribution Replacement<br />6. New Underground Electrical Distribution Work<br />7. Street Lighting<br />8.

Workforce Management and Consulting
Department of Veterans Affairs
Request for Information/Sources Sought
December 15th, 2015
I. Introduction: 
This is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement. 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation. At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  
II. Background: 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Workforce Management and Consulting (WMC) is evaluating the market to determine if there are commercial vendors with the capacity to assist VHA with the placement of experienced executives for the Administration.  The vendors would have the ability to recruit seasoned executives with extensive backgrounds as health care providers or health care management experience. 
VA maintains and operates the largest integrated health care system in America.  The VA health care system has grown from 54 hospitals in 1930 to 151 hospitals today; more than 700 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs); 288 Vet Centers; 98 Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Programs; and 133 Community Living centers.  VA health care facilities provide a broad spectrum of medical, surgical and rehabilitative care.  VHA's workforce consists of nearly 300,000 medical professionals and support staff, dedicated to providing service to Veterans and their families.  We must attract the best executive talent and promote VHA as an employer of choice.  

Employees within VHA are dedicated to ensuring that the men and women who served our country receive the services and are treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve.  To support this mission, VHA is committed to the investment and development of human capital, to include the executives who lead the delivery of care.  VHA is experiencing high turnover in its executive ranks as experienced leaders, both hospital-based and headquarters-based, become eligible to retire. 
 
Executive positions include those at the Administration's highest policy-making levels and impact the future direction of health care across the United States.  Position locations range from large metropolises to small rural areas around the country.  Timely filling of key vacancies with qualified leaders is more critical than ever.  Consequently, to recruit and retain key executives, VHA is seeking support in sourcing, recruitment, and placement of candidates for the most difficult-to-fill leadership positions.  
III. Requirements:
VA is seeking a contractor who can provide the following services:
1.	Evaluate the full scope of the required goals to ensure a successful candidate match and hiring experience. 
2.	Collaborate with agency to develop specific and detailed candidate profiles to ensure ideal individuals are identified.
3.	Develop and implement recruitment and marketing strategies to attract viable candidates.
4.	Coach and mentor the candidates through the hiring process for successful placement.

IV. Submittal Information: 
Responses will assist in determining the acquisition strategy used for this procurement. For example, if enough responsible and capable -Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) respond, the acquisition strategy will most likely be a SDVOSB set-aside; therefore, interested vendors who are responsible and capable of performing the work are strongly encouraged to respond by the date specified. At this time no acquisition strategy has been decided.
The following Information is requested in response to this RFI:
Please include: Company Name, Company Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, e-mail Address. Companies should provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate their capability to fulfill these requirements.

3.	Please be specific and provide a complete reference to include at a minimum the project name (and the government contract number, if applicable), contract award amount, start and completion dates, and the project owners' contact information. 
4.	Additionally, please provide the Contract Type: Firm Fixed-Price, Time and Material, etc.
*Self-Performed means work performed by the company themselves, NOT work performed by another company for them for any of the project examples provided.
5.	A narrative case study that describes the details of each project and why it is relevant to this requirement, including difficulties and successes.  
6.	A table listing all companies involved in the relevant project(s), including the technical expertise and percentage of work that each company provided.

3.	Specify any teaming arrangements and how those arrangements will impact the structure of services their company can provide including technical expertise provided by each company.  Please specify the percentage of work the each company will perform. 
4.	If the company holds a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract, list the GSA Contract Number and relevant Special Item Numbers (SINS) applicable to this requirement.

<CONTACT>Emmanuel T. Mbah, Contract Specialist, Email Emmanuel.mbah@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for FDA-CFSAN-2016 Chemical Analysis Services<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) in accordance with FAR 7.104(d). The potential small business will need to demonstrate the capability to perform all facets of the work described below.<br />The sole intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain capabilities for set-aside and procurement planning purposes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the proposed acquisition is 541380, Testing Laboratories with a small business size standard of 500 Employees. This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal, or other solicitation, and in no way obligates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to award a contract.<br /><br />The U. S Food &amp; Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions and Grant Services has a requirement to purchase "Chemical Analysis Services", for a Base Year (12 Months) and Four Option Years, in the Washington D. C. Metro Area, at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN).<br />General Description The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), and its various offices nationwide, including the Office of Regulatory Science (ORS), the Office of Food Safety (OFS), the Office of Food Additive Safety (OFAS), the Office of Compliance (OC), has a need to obtain information about the levels of chemicals in a wide variety of foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics, through the collection of food, dietary supplements and cosmetic samples, and their subsequent analysis by chemical analytical methods to be specified by CFSAN. <br />Background<br />In order to support the FDA's overall mission, CFSAN is required to produce information about the nature of chemical contaminants in food. Over the past several years, the agency has faced a wide range of issues related to direct and indirect contamination of food that have required information on the levels of specific chemicals. In many cases, the type of information required is a survey of the levels of contaminants in order to provide CFSAN with information necessary to formulate policy and to assess potential risks. In the past, this information has been provided by scientists within CFSAN: <br />i) Through small scale in-house surveys;<br />ii) Through contracts with outside laboratories and<br />iii) Through surveys conducted by the FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. The information from these surveys is not used for direct regulatory action, but is instead used to make decisions about scientific issues associated with food safety problems and to guide policy. This information was used to inform the agency about the nature of acrylamide levels in food, and was followed up in 2011-2014 by a larger study, done by a contract laboratory, which established the levels of acrylamide in a larger set of representative types of foods. This information was used to develop guidance about ways to reduce the occurrence of acrylamide in foods. Future studies will examine how guidance and policy have affected the levels of this chemical in foods. In 2011-2014, contract laboratory analysis was used to assess levels of inorganic arsenic in rice and rice products, as well as fruit juices, in order to obtain information used in developing risk assessments. Similar surveys were conducted to assess levels of 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), potassium bromate, semicarbazide and color additives in various foods, in order to address different programmatic needs within CFSAN. It is anticipated that CFSAN will continue to have such needs over the five years. <br /><br />SCOPE<br />The objective of this contract is to develop a capability to support CFSAN's research by rapidly assessing the quantities of specified chemicals in foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics through surveys of these commodities. The purpose of these surveys is to develop a better understanding of the quantities of chemicals and their distribution. The types of samples to be collected for these studies include food products from across the United States, including fresh fruits and produce, packaged and processed foods of all types, dietary supplements and cosmetics. The analytical targets of these studies include chemical contaminants in foods (e.g. pesticides, industrial chemicals), direct food additives, indirect food additives (those produced by processing or transfer from packaging), deliberate adulterants, nutrients, naturally occurring chemical components (such as metals), as well as the chemical constituents of dietary supplements, botanical extracts and cosmetics. The analytical methodology for any specified study will be established and provided by CFSAN, and shall include methods based upon state-of-the-art analytical techniques, including many based on instrumental analysis with various types of separation techniques and spectrometers. <br />Sample Collection The contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />Sample Collection: Collect raw, minimally processed (e.g. bagged), and processed/package foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics from local supermarkets and stores in major metropolitan areas in some parts of the United States. Cities chosen may include the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. CFSAN shall specify the type of commodity, the brand distribution, lot number and manufacturing date distribution, quantity and geographic location of the samples. While the geographic distribution is not expected to be extensive, the ability to obtain samples from major metropolitan areas is required.<br />Quality Control plan <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide CFSAN with a control chart for the QC samples.<br />Data reporting <br />The Contractor shall report data from analysis according to the procedures outlined below:<br />1. Reports with appropriate statistical analysis, as specified in the assigned analytical method provided in the SOW, shall be provided to CFSAN after completion of the assigned task.

COAs, spreadsheets, raw data and product package photos will be uploaded to a server that CFSAN will provide and identify. <br /><br />The contractor shall possess an ISO 17025 Accreditation or the equivalent. This is a "Go" or "No Go" requirement.<br />All services, unless otherwise agreed to by the COR (TBD), must occur or shall be performed at the contractor(s) facility.<br />Responses to this sources sought notice shall unequivocally demonstrate that the respondent is regularly engaged in the performance of the same or substantially similar services, tasks or items.<br /><br />At a minimum, responses shall include the following:<br />1. Three (3) years of relevant past performance information for the firm and/or sale of same or substantially similar services/items to include date of performance/sale, description (should also include drawings and photos), dollar value, client name, client address, client point of contact name, client point of contact mailing address (if different from that provided for client), client point of contact phone number, client point of contact email address, and name of the manufacturer (to include DUNS number and size status) if not the respondent; <br />2.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing three horizontal Diffusion/Oxidation/LPCVD furnace stacks. One stack will be configured for Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) and two stacks will be configured for atmospheric processes. The systems will be used to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The systems will be sited and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the CNST NanoFab. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the Diffusion/Oxidation/LPCVD furnaces that can meet <br /><br />NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>NIST intends to replace the existing systems with new systems in order to add the capability of processing 200 mm wafers in LPCVD processes and atmospheric processes at temperatures &ge; 1300&ordm;C. The system(s) will consist of 1 LPCVD stack and 2 atmospheric stacks. Each stack having at least 3 tube furnaces.</p>

The atmospheric stacks will be used for annealing, wet/dry oxidations and diffusions. All 3 stacks shall be capable of processing substrates &ge; 200 mm in diameter. The systems will be installed in a vertical laminar flow, class 100 cleanroom. Vacuum pumps will be located in the subfab beneath the process level. Each stack will be equipped with a source cabinet that contains all process gas panels. Each stack will be equipped with a cantilever load system and exhaust scavenger system at the load end. All 3 stack (9 furnace tubes) will be delivered as turnkey systems complete with quartz or silicon carbide fixtures, gas panels and vacuum systems.</p>
<p>2. Atmospheric Furnace Stacks <br />a. The furnace tubes will be horizontal.<br />b. The thermal flat zone shall be at least 12 inches long<br />c. There shall be at least 3 tubes per stack<br />d. The maximum temperature shall be &ge; 1300&ordm;C<br />e. Gas panels will have at least 5 gas channels<br />f. One tube shall be equipped with an external pyrogenic torch for wet oxidations</p>
<p>3. LPCVD Furnace Stack<br />a. The furnace tubes will be horizontal.<br />b. The thermal flat zone shall be at least 12 inches long<br />c. There shall be at least 3 furnace tubes in the stack<br />a. The tubes will be configured for polysilicon, Low Temperature Oxide (LTO) and silicon nitride.<br />d. The furnaces will be equipped with a vacuum system and associated instrumentation.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.

<p>FY16 Poe Lock Embedded Gate Anchorage Replacement</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Detroit District is seeking contractors for the "FY16 Poe Lock Embedded Gate Anchorage Replacement". The place of performance is Sault Sainte Marie, MI.</p>
<p>The project consist of the installation of new embedded gate anchorages behind the existing gate anchors and the connection to the lock gate leaf at the Poe Lock which is part of the Soo Locks Complex in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The Poe Lock is a 110 feet wide by 1200 feet long navigation lock which allows vessels to safely transit the 21 foot drop in water elevation between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes. The scope includes installation of new primary and secondary embedded anchorages at Gates 1, 2 and 3. The embedded gate anchorages distribute the top reaction of the leaf into the concrete lock wall. Each gate leaf is supported by two embedded anchorages, a primary and secondary embedded anchorage. The embedded anchorages are positioned adjacent to the top of the gate leaf, below the surface of the concrete lock wall.</p>
<p>Installation will require removal of concrete to install steel anchorage frames, drilling of concrete cores to accommodate concrete anchors, installation of steel anchorage frames and tensioned concrete anchors, and placement of new concrete.

<p>Solicitation Number: W912WJ-16-X-0009</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />USACE District, New England<br />696 Virginia Rd,<br />Concord, MA 01742</p>
<p>Description: The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:</p>
<p>The project will consist of the demolition of the existing Hanscom (Air Force Base) Primary School and associated building(s), the construction of a new primary school, and associated site work. The new primary building will be constructed adjacent to a newly constructed middle school building. The size of this multi-story structure will be approximately 80,000 sf. The project will utilize clear span or similar construction methods to allow easier reconfiguration to meet future educational needs. Near term flexibility and adaptability will be accommodated through the use of fully integrated acoustical-rated, operable wall partitions which contribute to the engineered acoustical performance of the building. The project will include 21st Century School concepts such as: learning neighborhoods, central hubs surrounded by learning studios, flex labs, information center annex, food service area, supply areas, specialist rooms, art room, music room, commons area for dining and social networking, therapy rooms, teacher work rooms, counseling areas, storage, administrative offices and other required areas for a fully functioning facility. The project also includes related infrastructure such as: parking areas, mechanical rooms, delivery areas, covered walkways, playgrounds and site improvements such as signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, exterior lighting and utilities. The facility will require enhanced commissioning upon completion to validate energy performance and must obtain LEED Silver certification. Phased construction will be required to accommodate this project without interrupting school operations. Temporary school facilities will be part of this project, as well as deconstructing and restoring the temporary site after the primary school construction has been completed.</p>
<p>The work for vertical construction may include but is not limited to: structural systems, roof systems, mechanical systems, plumbing systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, fire suppression systems, fire alarm systems, electrical systems, telecommunication systems, building security systems, and associated civil/site features (utilities, storm water and wastewater management, parking, roadways, grading, landscaping, and site security). Sub-contracts under this contract may also include the following types of work incidental to the vertical construction project: environmental abatement (such as lead paint or asbestos), general earthwork, miscellaneous interior/exterior elements, system testing, building commissioning, requirements for anti-terrorism and force protection (ATFP), LEED, LID, EISA, EPACT or incidental design.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25M and $100M.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Expected to begin Spring of 2016 and will extend over a 30 month period.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. The complexity of the project.</p>
<p>c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.</p>
<p>f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.</p>
<p>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.</p>
<p>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Construction Project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the construction project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades; do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc ..</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via email to Stephen Jones, Contract Specialist, at Stephen.e.jones@usace.army.mil no later than the close of business, 5pm EST on January 2, 2016.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a robotic arm with lightweight joints that provide a wide range of motion. The envisioned design provides users with a long reach and numerous degrees of freedom. The arm, ideal for use in aquatic environments or for manipulation of light terrestrial loads, consists of articulating booms connected by antagonistic cable tension elements. The arm elements are structurally efficient and lightweight, and support compact packaging. The inherent mechanical advantage provided by the tendon articulation allows the use of small, efficient motor systems. The manipulator can be scaled over a large range from 10m (load-bearing arm) to over 1000m (submersible or float-supported arm). Current efforts are focusing on a 15m prototype and a 300m subsystem to test the unique robotic architecture. NASA is seeking partners to develop its concept system for new applications. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed an algorithm, Airborne Wind Profiling Algorithm for Doppler Wind Lidar (APOLO), which offers highly accurate, real-time measurement of wind parameters (i.e., direction and speed) by airborne wind lidar sensors. APOLO enables the extraction of accurate wind speed and direction from noisy flight environments and provides correction for instrument installation biases. The algorithm has been incorporated into a supporting software package that displays accurate airborne Doppler wind lidar data and offers several data post-processing and display functionalities. The offset compensation and parameter extraction technology could be used in a variety of applications where the motion and orientation of a lidar sensor may result in data inaccuracy. NASA is seeking licensees that may benefit from integration of the compensation algorithm and data post- processing software into existing or developing systems. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<CONTACT>Phoebe V. Fuller, Contract Specialist, Email phoebe.v.fuller@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought / Request for Information, as well as an Industry Day Announcement. There will be no solicitation issued at this time. This posting is intended to further identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities and experience required to provide engineering services to the Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) Program, as described below, and encourage teaming arrangements between companies with the required capabilities. A draft copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for W91C9G-16-R-0001 and two (2) sample task orders are provided as attachments to this notice.
<p>This notice is being used for the purpose of determining market interest, availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to establishing the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal, including the use of any appropriate small business programs. All interested businesses are encouraged to respond; however, those businesses or joint ventures who responded to the previous RFI (W91C9G-14-A-JTE1) must clearly identify any information in their white paper that has been updated. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought notice. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>Information obtained from this notice will be reviewed to determine whether partial socioeconomic set aside(s) are feasible for performing the services identified herein. The anticipated NAICS code is: 541330, EXCEPTION: Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, $38,500,000.00 size standard.</p>
<p>The engineering services needed for this acquisition do not require performance by a licensed engineer, and are not appropriate for procurement using Brooks Act A-E procedures.</p>
<p>The funding type to be utilized for this requirement is Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E).<br /><br />This is a follow-on effort for the Deputy Director, Air Warfare (AW), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Director, Operational Test and Evaluation) (OSD (DOT&amp;E)) to provide technical and engineering services to the JT&amp;E Program. The OSD sponsors the JT&amp;E Program to conduct tests and evaluations and provide information required by Congress, OSD, the Unified Commands, and Department of Defense (DOD) components relative to joint operations. Congress established the JT&amp;E Program in 1972 after a Presidential Commission concluded that the DOD had no capability to conduct test and evaluation in a joint environment.</p>
<p>The objective of a JT&amp;E is to (a) assess Service system interoperability; (b) evaluate joint technical and operational concepts and recommend improvements; (c) validate testing methodologies that have multi-Service applications; (d) improve Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) applications; (e) increase joint mission capability, using quantitative data for analysis; and (f) provide feedback to the acquisition and joint operations communities.</p>
<p>The program is responsible for providing or obtaining technical and engineering analysis across the range of test activities. Test activities include test design; planning/execution and reporting. Specific activities include: test, engineering, planning; modeling and simulation, training, programming, data collection and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, integrated logistics functions, resource and program control, and development of briefings, test results, and technical reports.</p>
<p>The JT&amp;E process is composed of three separated but closely related activities: (a) the nomination, coordination and consideration of the nomination for inclusion in the JT&amp;E Program; (b) a Joint Feasibility Study (JFS) determination of the need and feasibility of approved nominations; and (c) the chartered joint tests (JT) which are the execution of these approved nominations that show potential for significant improvements in joint military capabilities. This acquisition will include both the JFS and the JT portions of this process. Also included are Quick Reaction Tests (QRT), which are short duration (approximately one year) tests in response to Warfighter emergent requirements, and Tests and Evaluation (T&amp;E) tasks, which provide T&amp;E services to various military organizations.</p>
<p>The JT&amp;E Program requires technical and engineering analysis across the range of test activities to include the preparation of technical reports, test design and planning, field test activities, data collection, data processing and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, analysis of system performance and related data, modeling and simulation, training, instrumentation and facilities, integrated logistic functions, resource and program control. The majority of the JT work shall be performed in the three Joint Test Units located at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and Suffolk, Virginia. QRT and T&amp;E task work may be conducted at any site both CONUS and OCONUS as identified by the Government in the specific task orders.</p>
<p>Although the current contract is unclassified, the project problem statements are classified; therefore, prime contractors are required to attend classified briefings prior to proposing on all task orders. Currently these classified briefings are conducted at least five (5) times annually, either at the JTU in Suffolk, VA or at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.<br /><br />All contract work is currently being provided by task orders awarded through four indefinite delivery contracts. The total capacity for the ten-year period on the current contracts, which ends January 07, 2017, is not to exceed $930 million.</p>

<p>(4) Contract management Support. The purchase order will be issued to Jacobs Technology, Inc., 5401 W. Kennedy Blvd., Suite 900, Tampa, FL 33609. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $519K.</p>

The contractor will be required to complete irrigation tracking sheets, check the pump for oil, check the gauges, ensure proper operation is maintained, keep a fuel tank record, order fuel when needed, receive fertilizer when delivered and apply fertilizer through the fertigation system.  

Routine Pump Maintenance - The contractor shall be responsible for performing basic pump maintenance, evaluating when more involved maintenance is required, and immediately notifying the project manager and maintenance team.

Cleaning the Rock Structure Screen System - The contractor shall access the rock structure screen system by either using a row boat or wading into the water after drawing down the Beal Ditch in both the east (Pump and Irrigation Reservoir) and west side embayment (Figure 2). Draw down is performed by closing the inlet gates and valves at the Topock Marsh/Beal Ditch connection, pumping the water to irrigate the cells, and scrubbing each of the eight wedge-wire screens with a stiff-bristled brush. This task takes approximately 1 hour, and is scheduled every other week unless otherwise directed by the Project Manager.

Checking Berms and Roads  Each field of the Beal Lake Riparian Area is separated from adjacent fields by built-up borders or berms.  These berms allow each cell to be independently flood irrigated.  The contractor shall be responsible for walking the perimeter of the fields being irrigated and checking the berms for blow outs.  In the event a berm is breached, the project manager must be notified immediately.  Additionally, if a Conservation Area road becomes difficult to navigate or impassible the project manager must be notified.

Manual Removal of Vegetation - Arrow weed and other vegetation tend to encroach on the roadways and walkways, grow around the irrigation valves, and spread along the top and embankments of the rock structure.  The contractor shall keep the roadways, walkways, irrigation valves and rock structure clear of vegetation for safety purposes due to common sightings of rattlesnakes in such locations  The contractor shall come prepared with loppers, a weed-wacker, a shovel, and other desired tools to manage thick vegetation in undesirable areas.

Please see attached Performance Work Statement for full details.  Also attached is photo of Rock Structure Screen System.

(vii)  The contractor shall be required to submit an irrigation log and equipment report showing dates, irrigation durations of each cell, hours required to be on site, hours scheduled, and hours worked, irrigation tracking sheets, fuel tank records, data sheets, and equipment reports to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.

    (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
  (c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-

    (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun & Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished.  Dun & Bradstreet may be contacted-
      (i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show-

    (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the best interest of the Government; accept other than the lowest offer if determined to be technically unacceptable; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br />Evaluation Factors for Award: Lowest price, technically acceptable. Offerors shall price each CLIN and also clearly state the overall cost to the Government. This is an all or nothing requirement, therefore, vendor shall provide a price for each CLIN as well as state the overall cost, otherwise your quotation will be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration.<br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Technical Features Meeting/Exceeding Salient Requirements (Brand Name or Equal)<br />2. Price</p>
<p>Proposal Instructions to Offerors:<br />Offerors are required to submit the following information in their quote:<br />Quotes must be firm-fixed-priced, and include all quantities and option periods<br />listed, all or none.</p>
<p>If proposing a solution other than the brand name, please include:<br />Details regarding how the proposed product satisfies each of the salient functional characteristics listed above. This portion of the quotation shall include all data and information required for technical evaluation of brand name or equal product. <br />Offerors are reminded to include a completed copy of 52.212-3 ALT I with their response, or provide an affirmative response that the offeror is registered in ORCA and all information in ORCA is current and complete. All clauses shall be incorporated by reference or full text in the order.<br />Offerors are to submit a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT).<br />The contractor is requested to hold price quotations for a minimum of 30 days. <br />Other Administrative Instructions:<br />Offerors responding to this RFQ must be registered with an Active status in the System for Award Management (SAM)<br />Central Contractor Registration (CCR). In accordance with FAR 52.212-4, Offerors shall be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line. Please visit the System for Award Management (SAM) at: www.sam.gov to register.<br />Quotations shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Karen Conroy @karen.conroy@fda.hhs.gov.<br />Quotations are due by 2:00pm Eastern Time on 12/22/2015.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION TITLE: INL Corrections Advisor<br />6. MARKET VALUE: $82,350 - $120,934 (FS-02 Equivalent)<br />7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award, with four optional years<br />8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Islamabad, Pakistan<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues, including corrections, for the Department of State (DOS). INL's corrections programs are overseen by the Bureau's Corrections Team Lead based in Washington, DC, Office of Civilian Justice Assistance and Partnership (INL/CAP) and the Bureau's Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP); and managed by the INL office in Islamabad, Pakistan (INL-Pakistan).</p>
<p>In October 2009, INL's Corrections Team Lead conducted an assessment of the corrections system in Pakistan and produced a written assessment with recommendations. The assessment concluded that Pakistan's overcrowded and crumbling prison system faces many challenges, but is not in a state of imminent collapse. The system is administered by the provinces with little federal support or guidance and is at more than double its capacity. This is because the system is filled with pre-trial detainees awaiting their court date in the country's clogged court system. Pre-trial detainees can wait for years to go to court, even for minor crimes. The prison staff is poorly trained, underpaid, and lack full control of facilities and prisoners. The current anti-militant campaign has implications for the system, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan, and Sindh provinces. A growing influx of dangerous and hard to manage detainees, coupled with two successful outside attacks on prisons in KP that liberated more than 400 prisoners, including approximately 35 militant leaders, in 2012 and 2013, threatens to push the system closer to a crisis point. This challenging situation has received high level attention and has prompted the U.S. Government (USG) to work to assist the Government of Pakistan with meaningful corrections reforms and improvements.</p>
<p>PURPOSE<br />The Corrections Advisor will serve as an in-country advisor responsible for implementing INL-Pakistan's corrections assistance efforts. S/he will oversee the development and expansion of INL's Pakistan Corrections Program in coordination with other USG, international and Pakistan law enforcement and criminal justice programs. This includes, but is not limited to, coordination with Pakistani authorities, management of corrections training, logistical and security planning, vendor/contractor coordination, and commodity provision to host nation correctional sector entities. The Corrections Advisor will work within Embassy Islamabad under the direct supervision of the INL-Pakistan Director or his/her designee. The Corrections Advisor will serve as INL's corrections subject matter expert in Pakistan, and provide expertise on all aspects of corrections matters in Pakistan, including, but not limited to: corrections personnel training and curriculum, prisoner classification; prison administrative procedures and information systems; prisoner reintegration, rehabilitation and disengagement programs including vocational and educational opportunities; appropriate management of vulnerable groups, including women, juveniles, and the mentally and physically ill; prison census and files, human rights issues related to prisoner incarceration; strategic planning and budgeting; and refurbishment and/or construction of correctional facilities.</p>
<p>DUTIES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES<br />In close coordination with INL-Pakistan staff and INL/CAP, the Corrections Advisor will be expected to perform the following duties:<br />Program Planning and Management<br />&bull; Manage corrections projects under the guidance and direction of the INL-Pakistan Director and Deputy Director (or designee) and INL/CAP and keep them informed of the details of such implementation, including progress, challenges, and recommended solutions.

<p>A copy of the solicitation will be available on or after August 19, 2015, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website.&nbsp; In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access.&nbsp; The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible.&nbsp; Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.&nbsp; For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk.&nbsp; Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in.&nbsp; Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system.&nbsp; For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.&nbsp; The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br />b)&nbsp;Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c)&nbsp;JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.&nbsp; Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d)&nbsp;For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS.&nbsp; Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx.&nbsp; DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e)&nbsp;Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.&nbsp; If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk.&nbsp; Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b)&nbsp;The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.&nbsp; Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />The Pre-proposal Conference will be held at&nbsp;U.S. Army Garrison West Point&nbsp;on October 19, 2015.

(b) Applicability. This clause applies only to--
(1) Contracts that have been totally set aside or reserved for small business concerns; and
(2) Orders set aside for small business concerns under multiple-award contracts as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).*

(d) Agreement. A small business concern submitting an offer in its own name shall furnish, in performing the contract, only end items manufactured or produced by small business concerns in the United States or its outlying areas.

(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Award for All or None. The Government intends to award one (1) purchase order as a result of this solicitation.

As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.<br />"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-<br />(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and<br />(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules).<br />"Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />(b) The Offeror [_] has [_] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.<br />(c) If the Offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the Offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information:<br />(1) Whether the Offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the Offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: <br />(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.<br />(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.<br />(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-<br />(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or <br />(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.<br />(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.<br />(2) If the Offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the Offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.<br />(d) The Offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the System for Award Management database via https://www.acquisition.gov (see 52.204-7).<br />(End of provision)<br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (OCT 2015) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government intends to award based on the best value, trade-off process IAW FAR 13.106. The Government may, if necessary, conduct discussions with all responsible Offerors within the competitive range if established. Award will be made to the best Offeror whose quote conforms to the terms and conditions of the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government. Therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest price or the highest technically rated offer.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation Methodology. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE AND TRADE-OFFS. The Government will base the determination of best value on a comparative assessment of the Offerors' technical approach, past performance, delivery, price and the other evaluation factors identified elsewhere in the solicitation. The determination of best value also considers the relative importance of the evaluation factors. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined are:</p>
<p>[X] significantly more important than price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach: The Offeror will provide a detailed technical package which describes the processes, equipment, facility, engineering capabilities, environmental controls, and experience levels of personnel, related to the levels of repair IAW the Statement of Work (SOW). The package shall describe processes that demonstrate technical capability to repair carbon fiber, fiberglass, aramid and kevlar, of monolithic and sandwich structural design. Composite panels, excluding carbon fiber, may have aluminum wire or screen imbedded into the surface of the panel to aide in electrical and static protection or has an anti-static paint applied. Dimple washers may be installed to protect sandwich panels from crushing loads when fasteners are tightened during panel installation in other structures, as well as, providing a means for electrical bonding. The package shall be prepared in an orderly format and in sufficient detail to enable the Government to make a thorough evaluation of the Contractor's technical competence and ability to comply with the solicitation requirements specified in the SOW. It must be clear, concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and substantiation of claim validity. Legibility, clarity and coherence are very important. The package should not simply re-state or re-phrase the Government's requirements, rather provide convincing rationale how the Offeror intends to meet the Government's requirements. Offerors shall assume the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's quote. Pricing must not be included in the technical package. Offeror in submitting its quote shall further:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide uncontrolled approved copy of the company's quality manual. Review will be based on the requirements set forth by the FAA part 145 advisory circular AC 145-9. <br />&bull; Provide a copy of the title 14CFR Part 145 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications which includes the Air Agency Certificate and Operations Specifications. <br />&bull; Provide documentation concerning FAA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) experience and capability to engineer repair procedures for composite components.</p>
<p>Technical approach will be rated in accordance with the adjectival categories in Table 1 below.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: In conducting past performance evaluations, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided by the Offeror and information obtained from other sources. Offeror shall provide in its quote a minimum of two past performance references with contact information (within the last three years) demonstrating performance of work similar in type and scope to that described in the SOW. Offeror is requested to forward the Past Performance Questionnaire found in Attachment C attached hereto to these references for prompt completion and request the responses be submitted electronically directly to the Contract Specialist of this solicitation no later than December 17, 2015 at 4:00 pm EST. Past performance questionnaires submitted by the Offeror will not be accepted. The Government reserves the right to verify past performance information and obtain past performance information using tools such as the Government's Past Performance Information Systems. If Offeror has no past performance history, Offeror must affirmatively so state. When past performance is not available, the Offeror will be evaluated as neutral.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall include documentation regarding their past performance as it directly relates to the work being procured under this solicitation. To illustrate Offeror's past performance, the following documentation shall be submitted: Offeror shall provide documentation outlining the Offeror's past performance with contracts, as a prime or major subcontractor, which is the same or similar in nature, size, complexity to the services being procured under this RFQ. The submittal shall include rationale how it was determined that the work performed previously was the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the work specified in the RFQ. Non-government contracts may be used if Government contracts are not available. Offerors electing to submit this data must furnish at least the following information: Name and address of the contracting entity; the contract number; award and completion dates; the dollar value; the contract type; the phone number, and any problems encountered and the corrective action taken by the Offeror. The documentation shall be submitted in the following format:</p>
<p>o Contract Number, Award Date and Contract Type.</p>
<p>o Price - Original Award and Final (or projected final, if contract is current).<br /><br />o Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by offerors may be used by the Government to evaluate Offeror past performance. However, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance as requested remains with the Offerors. Quotes that do not contain requested information risk being rejected or receiving a lesser rating by the Government. In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance, past performance will be rated as neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>o The Government will evaluate Offeror's Past Performance and assess relative risks associated with its likelihood of success in performing the requirements of this RFQ. Performance risk is assessed after evaluating aspects of the Offeror's recent past performance and focusing on performance relevant to the services procured hereunder. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's quote, data obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), similar systems, interviews with technical managers, contracting officers, commercial sources and other sources known to the Government. Areas of evaluation shall include:<br />&bull; Business Relations<br />&bull; Quality of Service<br />&bull; Schedule<br />&bull; Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>Past Performance will be rated in accordance with the adjectival categories in Table 2 below.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Delivery: The Coast Guard requires a maximum turn-around time of 30 days after receipt of components, for repair of HC-144 composite panels. Historical requirements to date show that quantities of panels issued for repair have ranged from 50 to 75 panels per delivery order. The Government will evaluate Offeror's capability to deliver quantities of panels within the required turn-around time.</p>
<p>Delivery will be rated in accordance with the adjectival categories in Table 3 below.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Price: The Government intends to award one firm fixed-price contract. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award the contract without discussions. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.</p>
<p>Pricing should be quoted separately for all levels of repair for all CLIN(s), for the base year and option periods as specified in the schedule. The Government will evaluate pricing for all levels of repair for all years. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if repair level prices and option year prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Table 1. Rating System for Technical Approach <br />Adjectival Rating Description</p>
<p>Superior Exceeds the RFQ requirements. The quote yields significant benefits to the Government through the demonstration of one or more strengths. Weaknesses, if any, are of small impact and NO significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />Satisfactory Meets all RFQ requirements. The quote offers no significant benefit beyond the stated requirements. NO significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />Marginal Fails to meet the minimum RFQ requirements, or has one or more significant weaknesses. Deficiencies and significant weaknesses are correctable without major quote revisions.<br />Unsatisfactory Fails to meet the minimum RFQ requirements. The quote has one or more deficiencies for which correction would require major revisions of the quote.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>REPAIR/MODIFICATION OF HC-144 AIRCRAFT</p>
<p>REMOVABLE COMPOSITE PANELS and STRUCTURES</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND<br />1.1 The Coast Guard currently operates eighteen (18) HC-144 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS DS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. These aircraft are procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the Coast Guard HC-144, changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M.<br />1.2 The aircraft consists of metal and composite components and structures. Composites include carbon fiber, fiberglass, aramid and kevlar, of monolithic and sandwich structural design. Composite panels, excluding carbon fiber, may have aluminum wire or screen imbedded into the surface of the panel to aide in electrical and static protection or has an anti-static paint applied. Dimple washers may be installed to protect sandwich panels from crushing loads when fasteners are tightened during panel installation to other structures, as well as, providing a means for electrical bonding.<br />1.3 USCG aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support of the USCG search and rescue missions, as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The HC-144 missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft. The HC-144 and its components are inspected by USCG personnel IAW the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic maintenance requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). Inspections of the aircraft routinely show evidence of corrosion of the rivets and dimpled washers. Corrosion is caused by dissimilar material where foil or screen used as lightning and static protection come in contact with the OEM washers, poor installation of washers during panel construction, or lack of proper corrosion protection during manufacture.<br />2.0 SCOPE<br />This SOW:<br />2.1 Establishes the minimum USCG requirements necessary for repair and modification of composite components and is not intended to be all inclusive. <br />2.2 Includes the inspection, evaluation, repair, modification and return of composite components used in support of the HC-144 aircraft to service in an airworthy condition that meets the design's original strength, stiffness, shape, lightning protection, and surface finish. To have composites structural integrity restored to an airworthy condition for continued service on the aircraft. <br />2.3 Includes the services of a contractor who has reverse engineering expertise and capability to manufacturer a new composite panel including replacement metal sub-components. The new panel characteristics shall meet or exceed the structural characteristics of the original panel.<br />2.4 The Coast Guard intends to award a requirements type contract for repair and modification of HC-144 composite panels and structures, with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders. The contract will be one base year with four option periods of one year each not to exceed a total of five years.<br />2.5 This SOW seeks multiple levels of repair services (listed in section 4.0) from a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center to effectively inspect, repair or modify removable HC-144 aircraft composite panels or structures to an airworthy condition for continued service on the aircraft. <br />2.6 Establish component turn time of 30 days after contractor receipt of the components. Historical requirements to date show quantities of panels issued for repair have ranged from 50 to 75 panels per delivery order. <br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS<br />The contractor shall:<br />3.1 Be a certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center and have experience performing aircraft composite component repairs. Have all the necessary provisions to perform the contract requirements, including but not limited to, required tooling, facilities, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, personnel, documentation, preservation, and shipping of all listed components.<br />3.2 Provide copies of all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certifications, and any other additional certifications, such as ISO or SIX SIGMA registration. If the Contractor for any reason loses its FAA or EASA certification during the period of performance, this constitutes a material breach of contract which may, at the discretion of the Coast Guard Contracting Officer, result in contract termination. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer verbally and in writing, not later than five (5) calendar days after certification forfeiture, and disclose all facts relevant to the forfeiture.<br />3.3 Have access to all applicable documentation and manuals to be used for the inspection and repairs of the Coast Guard HC-144 listed components. Applicable documentation or specifications revealed, published or updated prior to award or during the course of the contract period shall be considered within the scope of this requirement and may be added to the contract by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />3.4 Provide an uncontrolled copy of the company's quality manual.<br />3.5 Have or have access to, a FAA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) and capability to engineer composite components including metal structures from samples. <br />3.5.1 Submit upon USCG request a written quote detailing the manufacturing process as well as drawings to the USCG Contracting Officer for MRS Division Engineering Officer's approval. Work to reverse engineer a part shall not commence until approval is received from the USCG Contracting officer. <br />3.5.2 Test and/or certify newly manufactured panels meet or exceed the structural characteristics of the original panel.<br />3.5.3 Assign a new part number (P/N) to the reverse engineered panel. The panel shall be marked with P/N and contractors cage code IAW MIL-STD-130.<br />3.6 Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Repair Procedures<br />3.6.1 DER Repair procedures may be authorized on a case by case basis after review and approval by the Coast Guard Engineering Officer.<br />3.6.2 The contractor shall submit a complete technical package to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer showing an approved DER repair procedure on a FAA form 8110-3 which shall meet the original OEM operational requirements. This information will be treated as proprietary information. The Coast Guard will not release this information to other sources.<br />3.7 Beyond Economical Repair (BER):<br />3.7.1 When a part cannot be repaired due to damage that severely affects structural integrity of the panel. If a component is deemed BER the contractor shall notify the USCG Contracting Officer that the panel is BER within ten days (10) of component receipt. The contractor may propose a reverse engineering solution to manufacture a new panel including cost to the USCG Contracting Officer for MRS Engineering approval. The MRS Engineering Officer will evaluate the proposed solution and perform a cost benefits analysis and provide a go/no go decision to the USCG Contracting officer within fourteen (14) days of quote receipt. The USCG Contracting Officer will provide positive or negative feedback to the contractor within fifteen (15) days of quote receipt. If a decision is made to proceed with the contractor's solution the contractor shall not commence work until a contract modification is made by the USCG Contracting Officer. BER situations will be handled on a case by case basis. The contractor is not required to provide the OEM new cost for replacement of the panels when submitting the quote. <br />3.8 Missing parts (i.e. fasteners, hinges, seals, etc.): <br />3.8.1 Within ten (10) working days after the receipt and inspection of the component, the Contractor shall notify the USCG Contracting Officer in writing of any missing or damaged parts. The USCG Contracting Officer shall then have fifteen (15) calendar days to provide formal disposition instructions to the Contractor. The USCG will provide Ready for Issue (RFI) or repairable parts to replace the missing parts or funding to the Contractor to replace missing parts at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. <br />3.8.2 Replacement parts shall be new and have full traceability to the OEM.<br />3.8.3 The Coast Guard reserves the right to provide Government Furnished Property (GFP) to replace parts identified as missing or damaged.<br />3.8.4 Turn around Time (TAT) stops as of the date on the correspondence giving notification that work must cease due to the lack of the missing/cannibalized part. Unless the USCG Contracting Officer elects to have the component returned to the USCG as is, the TAT will re-start effective as of the date of the mutually agreeable date stated in the bilateral modification.<br />3.9 Corrosion<br />3.9.1 Low altitude flight over salt water contributes to greater corrosion damage in Coast Guard components than that experienced in commercial aircraft components. The Contractor shall consider the presence and effects of corrosion to be "normal" in this case and provide for correction and removal of corrosion in the firm fixed repair price. During inspection and functional testing, the presence of corrosion in an item or part thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection.<br />3.9.2 Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair the efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of any affected areas shall be accomplished IAW the manufacturer's specifications.<br />3.10 Exclusions<br />3.10.1 Components received in the following conditions are to be considered exclusions and may indicate an exclusion from the price in the contract schedule.<br />3.10.2 Catastrophic crash damage, foreign object damage, domestic object damage, Acts of God, war, and accidents attributable to the Coast Guard responsibility.<br />3.10.3 Alteration, modification or repairs that were not completed by the Coast Guard IAW technical data approved by the FAA, OEM, or the Coast Guard.<br />3.10.4 If a component is considered (by the Contractor) to fit the exclusion description, the Contractor shall notify the Coast Guard Contracting Officer within 10 working days and discontinue all actions until the Contracting Officer makes a determination. The Coast Guard reserves the right to appoint a Coast Guard Representative to witness the remaining teardown and inspection of the component. A letter of notification and the Teardown Inspection Report (TIR) report shall be submitted to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer for disposition of the component. The Contractor shall make the affected component available to a Coast Guard Representative to view the exclusionary damage. If the Government elects not to physically view the component, the Contractor's findings report shall stand.<br />3.10.5 Upon request by the Coast Guard's Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall submit a firm fixed price to include an itemized breakdown of material including nomenclature, part number, cost, and quantity of replacement parts, replacement percentages used to develop the original firm fixed contract price and the number of labor hours at the labor rates quote for additional funding required to restore exclusionary damage. This quote shall include all necessary supporting rationale and shall be submitted within forty-five (45) calendar days after notification is given to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer. Upon agreement of the parties, the Coast Guard Contracting Officer will authorize repair/overhaul, via contract modification, for restoration of the exclusionary damage above and beyond the original firm fixed price.<br />3.11 Environmental Requirements: <br />3.11.1 All parts must be thoroughly cleaned IAW applicable Component Maintenance Manuals or FAA Advisory Circular 43-205, Guidance for Selecting Chemical Agents and Processes for De-painting and General Cleaning of Aircraft and Aviation Products, to ensure they are as free as practical of all hazardous dust to include Hexavalent chromium, cadmium, lead, etc., prior to being returned to ALC.

<p>GENERAL GUIDANCE<br />Please use the following ratings to score the performance elements below (assessments should reflect only contractor-liable performance):</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to your organization's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to your organization's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.<br />Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the evaluation area being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the evaluation area being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.</p>
<p>EVALUATION: Rate the contractor in each of the following Evaluation Areas.<br />Quality of Product or Service. Assess the contractor's conformance to contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., specified technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). List and assess any sub-elements to indicate different efforts where appropriate. For example: Are reports/data accurate? Does the service provided meet the specifications of the contract? Does the contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? Assess the degree of direction given by your organization to solve problems that arise during performance.</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654;</p>
<p>Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />B. Schedule. Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). This assessment of the contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor's efforts during the assessment period that contributes to or effect the schedule variance. This element applies to contract closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as the assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation.</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Cost Control. Assess the contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost. For example, does the contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actual)? Did the contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings? Were billings current, accurate and complete? Are the contractor's budgetary internal controls adequate?</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Business Relations. Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, quote submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification and resolution of issues in controversy), and customer satisfaction. Is the contractor oriented toward the customer? Is interaction between the contractor and your organization satisfactory, or does it need improvement? Also, in making the assessment, include the adequacy of the contractor's accounting, billing, and estimating systems; and the contractor's management of, if a substantial amount of property has been provided to the contractor under the contract.</p>
<p><br />RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Management of Key Personnel. Assess the contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. For example, how well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract, with the person who filled the key position? Did the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively? If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this? If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract schedule?</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654; <br />Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />SUMMARY<br />Would your organization/company award another contract to this Contractor (or use the services of the Contractor again)? 0 Yes / 0 No</p>
<p>In summary, if you care to, please give your overall assessment of this Contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any additional comments to add?</p>

<CONTACT>Jackson, Edward
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for spot surface preparation and painting of damaged surface areas on the interior of the Upper Nevada Laterals.  The work is located at Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona.  This work is specifically on the Nevada side of Hoover Dam.

This work is not for full repair of the penstock coatings.  It is for limited repair of the areas of the interior portion that are damaged.  The principal components of repairing each penstock are anticipated to include the following: 

(1) Furnishing, erecting and relocation scaffolding system for the internal 13-foot diameter penstock laterals. The upper penstock 13-foot diameter laterals slope at an angle of 45 degrees.  Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long. (Laterals are simply the smaller pipes that branch off the 30-foot pipes to feed the hydro generators.); 

(2) Coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the interior 13-foot diameter penstocks sections; and 

(3) Control of leakage water, estimated to be approximately 200-500 gallons per minute (GPM) within the penstock, may be necessary.  The water can be plumbed directly through the drains of the penstock, and from there, the Government will pump the water into the river.  Care must be taken to isolate this water from any work that may contaminate this water.

This solicitation is Unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors, which has a small business size standard of $15M.  This acquisition will be pursued in accordance with FAR Part 15 and in accordance with the source selection evaluation criteria included in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price and non-price factors.  It is expected that the RFP will include evaluation factors for Relevant Experience, Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract as a result of this solicitation.  Award is expected by January 2016.  The estimated price range is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  

Offerors are required to have a current registration on the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/

A pre-proposal site visit will be scheduled for all interested parties.  Site visit information (e.g. date, time, location) will be provided with the solicitation.

It is anticipated that the solicitation, in the form of an RFP, will be issued on or about November 19, 2015.  No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued. The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FBO.gov. Offerors should register on FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation or visit the FBO website after issuance to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.

Creation of workflow forms is usually technically simple; the challenge lies in identifying and standardizing the clinical content of the form while balancing usability needs of a wide population of physicians. Proper training is necessary to ensure success of these workflows. Likewise, analysis of effort (i.e. metrics, both internal to the project - i.e. project process improvement, and external to the project - i.e. clinical process or patient outcomes) is just as important to the success of the project. Future workflows will require varying technical needs, based on the system at hand. This contract encompasses the entirety of the development lifecycle (planning, implementation, testing, documentation, deployment/training, analysis, and eventual closure) of workflow solutions across the enterprise.(See attachments for more information).</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;***<strong>*** NOTICE TO SUPPLIERS THE SOLICITATION NUMBER FOR THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM SPE4A516R0185 TO SPE4A516R0275************</strong>&nbsp;
<p>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add <span style="COLOR: red">16 </span>national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Boeing (3B1R2) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9416 under solicitation <span style="COLOR: red">SPE4A516R00275</span>, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Boeing&nbsp;(3B1R2)&nbsp;corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9416, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 2 and 3 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 09 February 2018. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of <span style="COLOR: red">16</span> NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total<span style="COLOR: red"> 16 </span>NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 3B1R2.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by <span style="COLOR: red">January 15, 2016</span>. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 16 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is <span style="COLOR: red">Thursday, December 17, 2015</span>.&nbsp;The anticipated closing date is <span style="COLOR: red">Sunday, January 17, 2016</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and the PMA 231 E-2/C-2 Airborne Tactical Data System Program Office, are seeking eligible firms capable of providing an E-2C (Naval passenger aircraft) flight qualified keyboard that can be seamlessly integrated into the AN/ASQ-225 Q-70 Advanced Control Indicator Set (ACIS) bullnose assembly of the E-2C aircraft without modification to the existing hardware or on board software and that addresses Foreign Object Damage (FOD) concerns with keyboard keys popping of during routine flight operations. The E-2C aircraft directs and controls tactical operations for the Naval fleet and coordinates tactical operations with other services in a Joint environment. The systems that provide these functions include the Mission Computer (MC) and the tactical operator workstations. Each AN/ASQ-225 Q-70 Advanced Control Indicator Set (ACIS) tactical workstation is composed of a flat panel display, bullnose assembly, and integrated computer. The bullnose assembly provides operator input to the Q-70 ACIS workstation via an integrated keyboard and trackball. Recent fleet reports indicate the bullnose keyboard keys are popping off and becoming FOD inside the aircraft.</p>

<p>1. The anticipated NAICS code is: 541330, EXCEPTION: Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, $38,500,000.00 size standard.<br />2. The Industry Day date, location, time and number of attendees is changed.<br />3. Request for specific Information is added.<br />4. Funding type is identified as Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E)</p>
<p>This is a combined Sources Sought / Request for Information, as well as an Industry Day Announcement. There will be no solicitation issued at this time. This posting is intended to further identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities and experience required to provide engineering services to the Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) Program, as described below, and encourage teaming arrangements between companies with the required capabilities. A draft copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for W91C9G-16-R-0001 and two (2) sample task orders are provided as attachments to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is being used for the purpose of determining market interest, availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to establishing the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal, including the use of any appropriate small business programs. All interested businesses are encouraged to respond; however, those businesses or joint ventures who responded to the previous RFI (W91C9G-14-A-JTE1) must clearly identify any information in their white paper that has been updated. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought notice. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>Information obtained from this notice will be reviewed to determine whether partial socioeconomic set aside(s) are feasible for performing the services identified herein. The anticipated NAICS code is: 541330, EXCEPTION: Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, $38,500,000.00 size standard.</p>
<p>The engineering services needed for this acquisition do not require performance by a licensed engineer, and are not appropriate for procurement using Brooks Act A-E procedures.</p>
<p>The funding type to be utilized for this requirement is Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E).</p>
<p>This is a follow-on effort for the Deputy Director, Air Warfare (AW), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Director, Operational Test and Evaluation) (OSD (DOT&amp;E)) to provide technical and engineering services to the JT&amp;E Program. The OSD sponsors the JT&amp;E Program to conduct tests and evaluations and provide information required by Congress, OSD, the Unified Commands, and Department of Defense (DOD) components relative to joint operations. Congress established the JT&amp;E Program in 1972 after a Presidential Commission concluded that the DOD had no capability to conduct test and evaluation in a joint environment.</p>
<p>The objective of a JT&amp;E is to (a) assess Service system interoperability; (b) evaluate joint technical and operational concepts and recommend improvements; (c) validate testing methodologies that have multi-Service applications; (d) improve Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) applications; (e) increase joint mission capability, using quantitative data for analysis; and (f) provide feedback to the acquisition and joint operations communities.</p>
<p>The program is responsible for providing or obtaining technical and engineering analysis across the range of test activities. Test activities include test design; planning/execution and reporting. Specific activities include: test, engineering, planning; modeling and simulation, training, programming, data collection and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, integrated logistics functions, resource and program control, and development of briefings, test results, and technical reports.</p>
<p>The JT&amp;E process is composed of three separated but closely related activities: (a) the nomination, coordination and consideration of the nomination for inclusion in the JT&amp;E Program; (b) a Joint Feasibility Study (JFS) determination of the need and feasibility of approved nominations; and (c) the chartered joint tests (JT) which are the execution of these approved nominations that show potential for significant improvements in joint military capabilities. This acquisition will include both the JFS and the JT portions of this process. Also included are Quick Reaction Tests (QRT), which are short duration (approximately one year) tests in response to Warfighter emergent requirements, and Tests and Evaluation (T&amp;E) tasks, which provide T&amp;E services to various military organizations.</p>
<p>The JT&amp;E Program requires technical and engineering analysis across the range of test activities to include the preparation of technical reports, test design and planning, field test activities, data collection, data processing and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, analysis of system performance and related data, modeling and simulation, training, instrumentation and facilities, integrated logistic functions, resource and program control. The majority of the JT work shall be performed in the three Joint Test Units located at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and Suffolk, Virginia. QRT and T&amp;E task work may be conducted at any site both CONUS and OCONUS as identified by the Government in the specific task orders.</p>
<p>Although the current contract is unclassified, the project problem statements are classified; therefore, prime contractors are required to attend classified briefings prior to proposing on all task orders. Currently these classified briefings are conducted at least five (5) times annually, either at the JTU in Suffolk, VA or at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.<br /><br />All contract work is currently being provided by task orders awarded through four indefinite delivery contracts. The total capacity for the ten-year period on the current contracts, which ends January 07, 2017, is not to exceed $930 million.</p>
<p>Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the company's claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities and teaming arrangements to satisfy the objectives described above. The white paper should discuss the company's experience and ability to perform the services and include relevant subcontractors and discuss teaming arrangements that would be utilized to perform the work; and should include points of contact and DUNS number or CAGE code for the prime contractor. In addition, please state whether or not the company has a facility clearance (FCL) at the Top Secret level. The white paper should be prepared in MS Word or Adobe, limited to four pages, and submitted electronically to Phoebe.V.Fuller@usace.army.mil by 4:00 p.m. January 12, 2016. The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.

<DESC>Project Description: The work includes the redistribution of approximately 250,000 cubic yards of previously placed dredged materials within the project limits, creation of a 3 to 5 acre marsh, creation of bird islands and ditch blocks, degradation of the east jetty, and incidental related work . Placement of dredged materials in fill areas will occur within a tidally constrained environment typically between -5 and +1 feet MLLW. Maximum dredging depth is approximately -18 feet MLLW. The construction of bird islands and ditch blocks will require the reuse of rip rap generated from the<br />degradation of the east jetty and the import of new material.
