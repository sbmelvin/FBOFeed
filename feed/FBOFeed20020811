<DESC>The 325th Contracting Squadron at Tyndall AFB, FL intends to award a sole source contract to Siemens Building Technologies for the installation of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) for existing HVAC system at base hospital.  The magnitude of the project is between $100,000 - $250,000.  Acquisition of specific make and model components are necessary due to the existing basewide components (DDC) manufactured by Siemens.  The DDC system at Tyndall currently utilizes Insight Apogee 600 software and controls, as manufactured by Siemens Building Technologies.  The DDC system utilizes a proprietary data interface on all the circuits tying to other remote computerized fire alarm reporting panels.  This proprietary data interface will not allow for interface of the Siemens Insight Apogee 600 system to any other manufacturer?s reporting system.  No manufacturer can interface to this proprietary data interface without obtaining a license for the computer language and data interface from Siemens Building Technologies.  The Base Civil Engineering office requires that all facilities provide for two-way interface with the base-wide DDC system for operational and maintenance purposes.  The central DDC system also serves as the base?s Energy Management Control System (EMCS).  Additionally, the UL listing required is typically only for a single manufacturer?s equipment.  It does not test intermixing of various hardware.  As a result, software from other manufacturers? systems will not allow proper communications with the Siemens Insight Apogee 600 software and hardware system, which is necessary for the Base Civil Engineering office to maintain service for facilities and equipment.  To assure compatibility with the existing Siemens components, it is required that only the addition of Siemens components be used to assure fully compatible and effective systems.

<DESC>7610 - SUBSCRIPTION - U.S. Dept. of Commerce/ITA intends to procure on a sole source basis the services of USA Recovery/Monitor to measure the travel behavior and traveler attitudes from D.K. Shiffet & Associates, Ltd.,7115 Leesburg Pike, Suite 300, Falls Church, Virginia 22043. The USA/Recovery/Monitor will focus on relatively frequent business and leisure travelers, and includes anticipated travel components with additional attitudinal/sentiment measures. This enhancement establishes an ongoing measuring system that allows for fast turn around information on expected travel, utilizing a projectable sample with historic comparisons among travelers who account for most of the country's travel expenditures. This enhance study yields psychological pattern information tied to behavior change data, with clear subgroup analyses.  A benchmark study is required along with Towline updates, intermediate report updates and full report updates.  Additionally, specifically relevant attitudinal measures such as "confidence" and behavior-change metrics are supplemented to reflect psychological segments with their "acted-upon attitudes" and changing spending patterns. Following a benchmark initial wave with psychological/motivational segmentation, measurement will initially be weekly with top-line results, plus in-depth monthly analysis.  Monthly breakdowns will include industry totals, sector detail (airlines, hotels by segment, etc),  travel purpose specificity (business vs. leisure), and traveler profiling including frequent business and leisure travelers.  Traveler segmentation will support communications focus and message/style refinement. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with High Precision Devices (HPD), Boulder , CO, for a quantity of 6,200 HPD Manual Flask Knobs.  The CMDL  Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases air sampling network utilizes custom glass valves manufactured by Glass Expansion, Ltd. (GE), which are the only valves that have been found compatible with the sample gases collected.  In order to obtain the required durability and flexibility necessary to prevent failure under the extreme temperature conditions encountered in field sampling, the standard GE valve handles are replaced by manual flask knobs designed specifically for this purpose.  GE does not manufacture an alternative valve handle, the valve components from other glass valve manufacturers are not interchangeable, and market research has not identified any other manufacturers of commercially available manual flask knobs for which the required performance test data is available. HPD currently manufactures a replacement manual knob that has been tested extensively in the CMDL Global Air Sampling Network. The HPD replacement knob meets the requirements for functionality and durability. Therefore, NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with HDP for the required manual flask knobs. This procurement is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13 (NTE $100K) as a simplified acquisition.  No solicitation is available.  Responses to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not a competitive procurement would be in the best interest of the Government and should include test data pertinent to product performance under conditions of extreme temperature and pressure.  The anticipated award date is September 9, 2002.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Coherent Laser Group, Denver, CO for a Verdi 8 Watt Laser System for inclusion in a newly developed pulse Ti: sapphire laser system.  The Ti: sapphire laser system requires an all solid-state laser source at 532 nm that is suitable for optical frequency measurements and nonlinear mixing with other single frequency sources.  The single frequency output radiation at 532 nm will be used in an optical frequency synthesis system that requires sum-and-difference-frequency mixing with other spectrally pure sources (e.g. stable 657 nm diode laser radiation).  The 532 nm laser output will also be frequency-doubled to 266 nm in an external power-enhancement cavity using the nonlinear crystal BBO for use in spectroscopic investigations.  The output power level at 532 nm must be 8 W or greater. ***The laser must operate in both a single transverse mode and a single longitudinal mode.  The single longitudinal mode must be single frequency with a linewidth less than 5 MHz.  Market research indicates that only the Coherent Laser Group product oscillates with a single frequency ****. The mode must be Gaussian (M2 less than or equal to 1.1).  The power stability is to be no worse than +/- 1% after a 30 minute warm-up, and the amplitude noise must be less than 0.05% from 10 Hz - 1 GHz.  The output polarization is to be linear (>100:1).  The beam waist should be on the order of 1 mm.  A delivery time of less than 4 weeks ARO is required for this research work to continue because the borrowed pump laser now being utilized must be returned.  This procurement is being conducted under the provisions of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  No solicitation is planned.  Responses to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.  The anticipated award date is September 11, 2002.
