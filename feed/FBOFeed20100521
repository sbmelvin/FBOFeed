<DESC>The Government would like to remind potential offerors during the pre-proposal stage of the AF-IPPS program to consider whether they might have any significant potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI). ESC first established a very comprehensive process to address OCI issues in 2004 thanks to significant input from our industry partners. The present 2008 policy is described at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/OCI-IDB2008.ppt.  This policy requires a thorough analysis of potential OCI issues in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate OCI. Early involvement is a key element of the ESC OCI process, so please evaluate your potential OCI issues during the pre-proposal stage of the acquisition process.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W911SE-09-R-0016.<br><br>Digital Video and Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS) is a state-of-the-art, 24/7 operation that provides a timely, accurate and reliable connection between media around the world and military units serving in both stateside and overseas.  The overseas locations include, but are not limited to Japan, The Horn of Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.  United States Army Central (USARCENT) Public Affairs Offices (PAOs) is the proponent for Army DVIDS program for Central Command (CENTCOM).  The PAO recognizes the value of having access to the DVIDS network, as have agencies outside of CENTCOM, to include other Army commands and sister services.  As a result, an efficient means is needed to acquire and field new systems to meet future DVIDS network expansion plans.  There are currently approximately 150 terminal systems in the DVIDS network.  New SATCOM terminal acquisition projections is for from 25 to 100 systems in the base year and 25 to 75 additional SATCOM terminals in each of the four successive option periods, with end strength projected at 525 terminal systems by the end of FY13.  Each new system will be fielded with a set of common use/high failure spare parts, so customers may perform user and organization level repairs on-site.  Helpdesk support is also required to help resolve equipment operation concerns for customers deployed world-wide.  Maintenance support is needed to provide preventive maintenance (scheduled maintenance) and unscheduled maintenance for DVIDS SATCOM terminals which are now in use or will eventually be purchased.  Repairs for terminals currently in use require an individual purchase request to secure necessary maintenance service and repair parts.  Training for system operators and field maintenance technicians has always been essential to the success of the DVIDS network even though it is not included along with the purchase of each system, and therefore training will also be purchased under this acquisition.  Since PAOs using DVIDS SATCOM terminals are at CONUS and OCONUS locations, access to training on a flexible schedule is important.  Lastly, contractor travel to provide maintenance and deliver training is inherently necessary.  Equipment users were limited to standard customer support and limited warranty maintenance support.<BR><BR>PWS: <BR>2.0  REQUIREMENT.

<DESC>   The One Shot program will develop a field-testable prototype, observation, measurement, and ballistic calculation system, which enable Snipers to hit targets with the first round, under crosswind conditions, up to the maximum effective range of the weapon (RE).  The system developed should provide day and night direct observation of the target, measure all relevant physical phenomena that influence a ballistic trajectory, and rapidly calculate and display both the aim point offset and expected crosswind variability (confidence metric) in the shooters riflescope.  The system must exploit novel technologies to operate over a range of visibilities, atmospheric turbulence, scintillation, and environmental conditions.  The performance of the system culminating from this investigation and development will be scored against Program Metrics provided in Program Metrics section summarized below.  The current Phase is a follow on effort to the previous development of One Shot system under Phases 1 and 2 (option 1).  The new Phase will be an enhancement to the technologies developed previously in the prototype system.  The new effort will be conducted under Phase 2 Enhanced (Phase 2E) and will result in the delivery of 15 fully operational and field hardened systems in the Base Phase with purchase of up to 100 additional units in Spiral 1 with the potential of further improvements in technology in Spiral 2.

<DESC>The USPS Great Lakes Facilities Service Office (GL-FSO) is soliciting contracts for Architect-Engineer Services for Repair and Alteration projects and the Site Adaptation of Standard CAD designs.  Work may include the preparation of plans and specifications, including general A/E project investigation, design, and observation on postal owned and/or leased facilities of various sizes, locations and functions. The U.S. Postal Service reserves the right to award more than one contract in one or both of the Milwaukee/Madison and/or the Green Bay/Wausau/Appleton geographic areas. This contract will be primarily for tasks within the State of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, however at the sole discretion of the USPS, it may be selectively utilized for work within the geographic area of responsibility of the USPS GL-FSO (IL, IN, MI, WI, & Eastern MO). The contract will have a minimum aggregate work order value of $5,000 and will be for two (2) years, with individual work orders being issued. The contract may be renewed for three (3) one-year periods providing the total contract amount does not exceed $5,000,000. Work orders for any one project cannot exceed $250,000. Each work order will be negotiated as an individual project. Groups of projects may be assigned at one time. Any resulting contract may be bilaterally modified to meet changing Postal regulations and needs. Building and site repair and alteration projects vary in scope and magnitude and may range from interior alterations, roofing and HVAC replacement to exterior paving civil improvements (cost range generally from $0 to $1,000,000 or more).  The USPS Standard Building Designs include 1) Small Standard Building Designs (SSBD) from 1,000 SF to 10,000 SF; 2) Medium Standard Building Designs (MSBD) from 10,000 SF to 50,000 SF, 3) Retail Store Designs, and 4) Modular site adaptation, and may also include the site adaptation of previously designed facilities and other Postal Standard Plans.

The general A/E scope of work will consist of investigation, design, preparation of proposal documents, construction budget and cost estimating, project and contract administrative duties, and observation of project construction for noted project types. Submitting firms must have a minimum of Auto CAD LT 2006 capability. Firms must possess a working knowledge and experience with the Architectural Barriers Compliance program (Postal Service Handbook RE-4, Standards of Facility Accessibility by the Physically Handicapped), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Significant evaluation factors include: 1. capacity of firm to accomplish multiple projects, 2. past postal experience in projects of similar scopes and magnitudes, 3. proficiency in the use of AutoCAD, 4. professional qualifications of staff to be assigned to projects, 5. cost control effectiveness, 6. construction observation and administrative experience, and 7. workload. Firms that have the qualifications to perform the services described previously are invited to submit a completed SF330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications for the prime firm as well as for each proposed consultant. 

The evaluation will be conducted by using the submitted SF 330s. Interested firms with more than one office must indicate on their SF 330 the staffing composition of the office in which the work will be performed. Consideration will be given to firms responding to this advertisement in the following order of preference: 1. within the Milwaukee/Madison geographic metropolitan areas (described as within the counties of Dane, Jefferson, Washington, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Racine or Kenosha), and/or within the Appleton/Green Bay/Wausau geographic metropolitan areas (described as within the counties of Marathon, Shawano, Outagamie or Brown), 2. within the State of Wisconsin, and 3. out of state. Architectural and Engineering firms will be considered as local only if their sole office is in the local geographical area or they have a local branch office and all the architectural design, coordination, and management for the contract will be performed in that office. There is no restriction on the geographical location of consultants. Minority-owned and Women-owned Business participation is encouraged. The contract contains a requirement for firms to provide evidence of current insurance of $250,000 of errors and omissions per claim if construction costs are estimated at less than $5,000,000.  For construction costs estimated to exceed $5,000,000, coverage equal to a minimum of 5% of the cost estimated or $500,000, whichever is greater, is required for errors and omissions per claim.

To be considered, the office location must be within the boundaries of: McCaleb Lane to the North; Baker Street to the South; Cheyenne Mesa to the East; and Cage Street to the West in Hamilton, Hamilton County, Texas. Preference will be given to first floor space. Occupancy is required by September 1, 2010.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<CONTACT>Moira Baran, Contract Officer, Phone 2022456293, Email MOIRA.BARAN@ED.GOV
<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board is preparing to develop achievement levels for the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Writing Assessment at Grades 8 and 12. The Governing Board is issuing this Request for Proposals under full and open competition in mid June, 2010. Proposals will be due about July 26, 2010. The base period of performance is anticipated to be approximately 24 months. An optional 24 month task to develop achievement levels for the 2013 grade 4 writing NAEP may be exercised during the base 24 month period of performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Student performance for the writing NAEP is assessed entirely through collection of student essays in response to writing prompts. Students have approximately 25 minutes to respond to each of two prompts that will be presented on the computer. This is the first completely computer-based assessment in the NAEP program, and the Governing Board intends to incorporate computerized methods in the achievement levels-setting process. The operational assessment for grades 8 and 12 will be administered in 2011, and data will be available for the achievement levels-setting work by September 2011. The initial computer-based assessment for grade 4 writing will be administered in 2013, and data will be available for the achievement levels-setting work by September 2013. The Governing Board prefers to have the same process and methodology implemented for developing achievement levels for all three grades, and an optional task will be included for grade 4 work.</p>
<p>The basis for contract award is be that technical capability of the offeror is more important than cost and other factors considered. All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to the solicitation. The Request for Proposal will appear on the NAGB website <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.nagb.org</span> when it is posted on Fedbizopps. Emailed requests for the electronic RFP when it is issued may be emailed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moira.Baran@ed.gov</span>. All timely responses received shall be considered by the Governing Board.&nbsp; A cost reimbursement type contract is contemplated because of the uncertain costs&nbsp;surrounding this research.</p>
<p>Questions and comments on this notice may be submitted to the Contract Officer, Moira Baran by Monday, June 7, 10 am, EST at Moira.Baran@ed.gov, and responses will be posted by approximately five working days after receipt.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Emory University-Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, GA  30329 for the project entitled, Search for the Auditory Engram in Chimpanzees.  This project involves training chimpanzees to perform an auditory delayed matching-to-sample-task to test long-term memory.  The chimpanzees at Yerkes have had extensive behavioral training on matching-to-sample type cognitive tasks.  In particular, they have training on matching vocalizations with appropriate facial expressions.  Because of this, memory will be assessed to determine if there is any long-term memory in this type of task.  Thus, the chimps will have to remember the vocalization for several seconds before they can match to the appropriate face.  Once testing is complete for this task, the chimps will then be tested directly on an auditory recognition memory task.  Testing will be done in the Yerkes Cognition Room, using a touchscreen set-up.  For the Auditory match-to-sample training, a trial begins with a sound (2s) from a single speaker.  Touching the touchscreen during the sound will not be rewarded, but will, instead, immediately trigger a second sound (2s) presented through the same speaker.  If the sound matches the sample sound touching the left spot on the touch screen during the second sound will result in a reward.  If the sound does not match the sample sound then touching the spot on the right of the touch screen results in reward.  The chimps will be tested on 100 trials a day.  The sounds will be from a set of 900 junk sounds that includes natural sounds to synthetic sounds.  The chimps will be trained on this or a modified version until they perform above 85% correct.  To test the chimps auditory memory, a very short delay will be introduced at first between the sample and test sounds.  Then the delay will be gradually increased until the chimp no longer performs significantly above chance.  

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be conducted at Yerkes National Primate Research Center, where access to test chimpanzees is available.  The Yerkes primate center has an expert in chimpanzee cognitive behavior and has an interest in memory processes.  The team of investigators has the expertise and experience to complete the proposed work, thus it is cost efficient to continue the ongoing collaboration.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>Acquisition of Clean Top Optical Table to accommodate STACIS iX Laser Table-Base Active/Passive Vibration Isolation System
<SOLNBR>NOI-1554889
<RESPDATE>060110
<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to procure on a non-competitive basis with Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), 15 Centennial Drive, Peabody, MA 01960 for a STACIS iX Laser Table-Base Active/Passive Vibration Isolation System and a Joined Top Optical Table. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334519 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The NINDS Research in the Synaptic Physiology Section (RSPS) focuses on synaptic transmission in different areas of the central nervous system. Recently, experiments have studied synaptic signaling within small microcircuits within thin neuronal processes. This involves using two-photon imaging of very small structures with calcium indicator dyes over two-hour-long experiment times. Such techniques require high-power lasers, sophisticated light microscopes and very fine-scale mechanical micromanipulation. These experiments reflect the cutting edge of experimental neuroscience and are crucial to the RSPS' understanding of synaptic processing within intact neural circuits.<br /><br />Mechanical stability is paramount in physiological imaging experiments, and the apparatus is mounding on a large vibration isolation table. The intrinsic vibration characteristics of Building 35 at NIH introduce significant difficulties with regard to achieving a vibration-free environment required for the required experiments. Specifically, the building's intrinsic resonance frequency falls within a range (1-2 Hz) that is actually amplified by traditional passive (pneumatic) air tables. TMC recently developed a new system, combines active and passive mechanisms to produce a table that can eliminate larger-amplitude vibrations in the 1-2 Hz range.<br /><br />The following salient characteristics apply to the required items:<br /><br />1. One (1) Clean Top Optical Table, joined, supported by STACIS iX, TMC Model No. 784-Special includes: joined optical table, two 5-foot square, 12" thick sections with machined joiner plates for end-to-end configuration; cleantop, individually sealed holes; flatness &plusmn;.005"; 3/16" thick ferromagnetic stainless steel top plate with matte finish; &frac14;-20 tapped holes @ 1" o.c. array; plated steel honeycomb core with .49"2 cell size; maximum damping, research grade.<br /><br />2. One (1) STACIS iX Laser Table-Base Active/Passive vibration isolation system, TMC Model No. 21-38007-01 includes patented piezo-electric vibration isolation; digital controller, LCD user interface; Integrated with patented MaxDamp isolators in series for optimized performance from 0.6 to 250Hz; for 59 x 120 x 12" table.<br /><br />3. One (1) STACIS Certification and Table Joining includes On-site STACIS iX set-up assistance with optimization and certification; Optical table joining in concert with riggers; does not include rigging which is the responsibility of NIH.<br /><br />The Clean Top Optical Table and its accompanying STACIS iX Vibration Isolation System developed by TMC is a patented product sold and manufactured worldwide solely by TMC. The STACIS iX Laser Table incorporates patented Maxdamp passive and active isolators with patented STACIS technology and piezoelectric extended actuators. This combination provides the most advanced vibration isolation system for extreme environments. These environments are found in building 35 and this isolation is needed for laser imaging done by the Diamond Lab. The STACIS system is the only commercially available vibration isolation system utilizing piezoelectric transducers to directly attenuate floor vibration resulting in a one of a kind actively controlled design.<br /><br />The Clean Top Optical Table and accompanying STACIS vibration isolation system will be used to continue studies in the hippocampus in an effort to gain insight into the mechanisms by which learning and memory are implemented at the synaptic level. In the retina, the NINDS scientists hope to help explain how visual information is transformed into a neural code and how the visual system's exquisite spatial acuity is preserved. With the aid of this isolation system the NINDS scientists will be able to approach these questions experimentally using electrophysiological and imaging methods in hippocampal and retinal slice preparations.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 333997   Synopsis for a Pipette Calibration System


	The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with a calibration system for pipettes 4-6 weeks following the award of contract, for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), and National Risk Management Research Lab (NRMRL) located in Cincinnati, OH.
	A calibration system for pipettes is needed to support the activities of a centralized (NRMRL) - Cincinnati calibration laboratory.  The nature of the acquisition requires a simple, ergonomic, and efficient pipette calibration system that can be used for both single and multi-channel pipettes.  The system must include a conventional balance (readability to 0.01 mg) and must be fully automatic and include software to optimize equipment and data management.  The calibration system must also be compact and easily transportable for potential use across NRMRL locations.  Additional specific requirements include having a single channel set with evaporation trap, multi-channel set for up to 12 channels with calibration set with certified weight, includes an exhaust pump and reservoir for collecting test fluid.  These specifications are essential for performance because they are needed to provide a quality, cost-effective means to develop an in-house pipette calibration program.  	The EPA has identified Mettler Toledo as the only provider that meets all specifications for a calibration system for pipettes.
	This procurement will be accomplished under FAR 13.501(a)(ii) Sole Source.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Gerold Young by fax to 513-487-2853 or by email to young.gerold@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to procure up to four 4-Wheel Drive Medium Duty Dynamometers.   This acquisition will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.
EPA is undertaking a comprehensive program to enhance its capability to conduct low level emissions testing of the highest precision and accuracy at its NVFEL facility in  Ann Arbor.  As a result of the Renewable Fuel Standards program, increased emphasis will be placed on testing vehicles operated on renewable fuels.  Other enhancements will enable performance of both cold-temperature and air conditioning testing.
The full Statement of Work (SOW), which will be included in the solicitation, describes the engineering and operational requirements for chassis dynamometers that will be required for implementing these enhanced capabilities.  The equipment implementation described in the full SOW is comprised of a four-wheel dynamometer for a new Cold Test Facility being built at NVFEL, an option for purchase of a second system for use in a test site planned for high-temperature (SCO3) testing, and an option to procure up to two additional dynamometers to replace existing equipment.  The agency intends to issue an award for first 4WD dynamometer and exercise options for up to three additional dynamometers within 18 months after the date of contract award.
Federal regulations for exhaust emissions and fuel economy of motor vehicles specify tests using chassis dynamometers.  The purpose of the chassis dynamometer is to duplicate the forces encountered by a vehicle moving on a road by modeling those characteristics with a stationary vehicle on a rotating surface.  The dynamometer specified in the full SOW will provide EPA with additional testing capabilities to support both current and future regulations as well as a range of evaluation and development activities.  This dynamometer will be used to test a wide range of vehicles including front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, four wheel drive and all wheel drive with the full range of powertrain technology including those providing energy conservation through regenerative braking.  These vehicles will include those powered by some combination of internal combustion engines, electric motors and storage devices, hydraulics and hydraulic storage systems, and fuel cells.
The dynamometers shall incorporate the following general features for testing these vehicles:
Accurate and precise road load determination and simulation, utilizing the latest technology, through a digitally-controlled, electrically-activated, motor-absorber that recreates the mechanical inertia and frictional forces that would be present on the road with electrically generated load forces based on specific equations, coefficients and response characteristics.
Vehicle loading applied to the tires by 48" diameter rolls connected to intermediate motor/absorbers on a per axle configuration that contacts each vehicle tire.
Capability of testing all light duty vehicles, medium-duty passenger vehicles and  complete heavy duty vehicles up to 14,000 GVW on a Federal Test Register US06 Driving Trace which has a maximum acceleration rate of 8.0 MPH/second, in two wheel drive and four wheel drive configurations.  Vehicle testing shall be accomplished by simulating all load conditions that the vehicle can experience on a dry smooth road.  Hence, the roll sets shall operate with synchronous speeds in order to simulate conditions that would reasonably occur on the road.
The chassis dynamometer shall conform to the requirements specified in the full SOW.  For the equipment specified, the Contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff.  The Contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.
Award will be made on a ?Best Value? basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important that price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed dynamometer to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant corporate experience.  The solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps website on or about June 16, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Samantha Fuchs, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487 2347, or  e mail at fuchs.samantha@epa.gov.   Questions must be submitted in writing to Samantha via fax  or e-mail.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

For Functional Categories 2 and 3, there will be set-asides for small business. All of the set-aside categories have a $25M small business size standard. Solicitation Section L.8 provides the associated NAICS for each functional category.</p>
<p>EAGLE II will allow offerors to submit proposals that include up to four core team members. Although teaming is not required to submit a proposal, offerors may consider teaming as a means to more fully meet the array of requirements and resources potentially required by DHS under EAGLE II.</p>
<p>DHS welcomes your comments about the draft solicitation. Written comments received at EAGLEIIOutreach@dhs.gov on or before June 25, 2010 will be considered for inclusion in the final EAGLE II solicitation. However, the Government will not issue direct responses to vendor comments or questions at this time. If submitting comments, please make reference to the specific page, paragraph and text of the RFP. Due to the anticipated level of interest, the ITAC will not entertain requests for contractor visitations or marketing calls.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The objective of this innovation effort is to provide for Improvement of Inpatient Glucose Control through Integrated Systems of Care:  by refining the Glycemic Monitoring Window (GMW) through broadening the approach of the window to be used throughout the VA and developing a GMW that meets enterprise standards and is poised for release nationwide.

AFCEE anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) basic contracts under NAICS Code 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services). The size standard associated with this NAICS code is $7 million. AFCEE currently anticipates awards to be made using full and open competition and partial Small Business set-asides. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. Individual Task Orders (TO) will be awarded utilizing the terms and conditions of the basic contracts. AFCEE is considering the inclusion of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements in each basic contract. Additionally, AFCEE currently anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five years with one additional year for completion of performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov). The program ceiling for this procurement is estimated to be $625 million.</p>
<p>AFCEE requests comments from interested parties to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. The current GEITA05 contracts have cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) and firm-fixed-price (FFP) pricing arrangements. The government anticipates using these pricing arrangements for GEITA11. <br />a. What are industry comments and concerns with continuing these pricing strategies?<br />b. What are industry comments and concerns if Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and/or Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) pricing arrangements were used on GEITA11 in lieu of CPFF?<br />2. The government is considering incorporating fully burdened FFP labor rates in the GEITA11 basic contracts. This would be similar to other AFCEE contracts. Request industry comments on using this strategy considering the global scope of AFCEE requirements.<br />3. The source selection approach for GEITA11 is in the process of being established.<br />a. What are industry comments on the pros and cons of using Price Performance Tradeoff (PPT) source selection procedures for this effort?<br />b. What are industry comments on the pros and cons of using Full Trade-Off (FTO) source selection procedures for this effort?<br />4. The draft GEITA11 Performance Work Statement (PWS) dated 18 May 2010 is attached. Please discuss your company's past experience in providing these types of services. <br />5. The government is considering adding more detail to the metrics for the Services Summary (SS) in the GEITA11 contracts (see paragraph 3.0 of the attached draft GEITA11 PWS). <br />a. How could we improve the SS for GEITA11?<br />b. If you have other A&amp;AS contracts, what metrics do they use? <br />6. The government requires information concerning resources required for performing A&amp;AS services under the GEITA11 program to enhance planning and future strategies. The government will add data reporting requirements (Management Deliverables) to the GEITA11 contracts for hours and types of labor utilized and period of time to complete tasks and/or produce deliverables. <br />a. Please provide input concerning existing or recommended methods of receiving this data from contractors in a format compatible with Microsoft Office products (e.g. in Excel Spreadsheet or Access Database format). Examples or templates currently used by industry in collecting, managing and analyzing these data elements would be appreciated. <br />b. Please specify how you ensure data is complete, timely and thorough. <br />c. Please discuss the pros and cons of collecting this data on a contract-wide basis VS task-order basis.<br />d. Please discuss the ideal reporting cycle - i.e. 30 days or other recurring cycle.<br />e. Please address the cost impacts of delivering this data at the task order level.<br />7. What is the historical maximum work load your firm has managed while assuring effective program/project implementation and maintaining quality products?<br />8. What is the historical range of dispersion of work you have performed simultaneously throughout the world?<br />a. Where has your firm performed in CONUS as well as OCONUS locations in the past?<br />b. Please tell us how you would manage and perform the full scope of requirements presented in the draft GEITA11 PWS in both CONUS and OCONUS locations.<br />9. In terms of evaluating a company that submits a proposal for GEITA11, what critical evaluation criteria would differentiate companies' capabilities? Explain your rationale in detail. <br />10. Attached is the current GEITA05 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 for your reference. <br />a. Please comment on any concerns you may have. <br />b. What should the government be considering?<br />11. When you respond to this RFI, inform the government whether you are a large or small business under the NAICS Code 541620. Sub-categories include 8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business, veteran owned small business, HUB zone small business, service disabled veteran small business, and HBCU/MI. If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories?<br />12. For small business consideration:<br />a. Would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 541620? <br />b. If not, why? <br />c. Please provide your recommendations concerning the anticipated number of contract awards, how many contracts should be reserved for small business, and the proposed NAICS.<br />13. If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?<br />14. Would you participate in the acquisition with other firms as teaming members or joint ventures? What other teaming opportunities do you see for this acquisition?<br />15. The proposed subcontracting goals for GEITA05 were: Small business - 23%; Small disadvantaged business - 5%; Woman owned small business- 5%; HUB zone - 3%; Veteran owned small business- 3%; Service disabled veteran owned small business- 3%. All of these percentages were based on the prime's anticipated subcontracted dollars. AFCEE has moved towards the Small Business goal being based on actual obligated dollars and the sub-categories being based on anticipated subcontracted dollars. <br />a. What are the pros and cons of doing this scenario with GEITA11? <br />b. What are your actual percentages and subcontracted dollars to small businesses, to include all sub-categories, for this type of work?<br />16. Is your company able and willing to perform efforts worldwide?<br />a. If not, please explain.<br />17. In your view, is the proposed NAICS code (541620) the most appropriate code for this work?<br />a. If not, please provide your rational why not.<br />18. What are industry comments on the pros and cons of using one (1) Request for Proposal (RFP) with full and open competition and partial small business set-aside competitions verses utilizing multiple RFPs for each competition level?<br />19. What are industry comments if you were putting together a RFP for an effort of this magnitude<br />a. What would you expect to see from the offerors in terms of experience?<br />b. What would you expect to see from the offerors in terms of performance?<br />c. What page limitations would you place on proposals received?<br />20. What is your capability to effectively manage simultaneous, geographically dispersed A&amp;AS task orders?<br />a. How can this capability be most effectively demonstrated to the Government under a solicitation? <br />21. Pre-Proposal Conference:<br />a. Do you think a pre-proposal conference is necessary for GEITA11? <br />b. If so, what topics would you like to have discussed in the government/contractor meeting?<br />22. There are positions that require a SECRET clearance; as a result your company must possess at least a SECRET facility clearance. If you do not have a facility clearance, what is your plan in obtaining the required clearance prior to contract award?<br />23. Please include the following with your response: <br />a. Name and address of firm <br />b. Point of contact and telephone number <br />c. Average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees <br />d. Business size<br />e. Affiliate information: <br />i. Parent company<br />ii. Joint venture partners<br />iii. Potential teaming partners.</p>
<p>The government encourages you to submit any additional comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us regarding GEITA11. We welcome your participation to make GEITA11 a model acquisition. Please note that official information will be provided by the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist. Any information received from other sources should not be relied upon as official.</p>
<p>Email your responses by COB 3:00 PM CST on 01 June 2010 to GEITA11 Points of Contact: Kim Walton, Contracting Officer, kim.walton.1@us.af.mil and Linda Cavazos, Contract Specialist, linda.cavazos@us.af.mil.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.
The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday, 8 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Mr Herbert B. Countee, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and can be submitted to herb.countee@losangeles.af.mil. Inquiries may be directed to Mr. Countee at 310-653-9525.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Product Manager  Individual Weapons, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is conducting a market survey to gather information about commercial small arms soft cases and 12 gauge shotgun magazine pouches. The magazine pouch shall hold a total of four magazines of either of two sizes: 3-rounds or 5-rounds.    The largest (5-round) magazine can weigh approximately 17 oz including the rounds.  The 5-round magazine dimensions are 1  in wide, 3 3/16 in deep by 6 3/8 in tall.  The smaller (3-round) magazine dimensions are 1  in wide, 3 3/16 in deep and 4 5/8 in tall.  The magazine pouch shall accommodate a total of four magazines of either size simultaneously.  The four magazines should be arranged in the pouch so that the longest horizontal dimension (depth) of two magazines is next to the wearer and the base of the magazine toward the ground.  The magazine pouch shall be designed so that the magazines can be easily pulled from/placed into the pouch using one hand and be made of durable, protective material and components suitable for field conditions.  The magazine pouch shall allow for water drainage from inside each pouch.  The magazine pouch shall include protective covers to limit environmental exposure (dust, dirt, and debris) of the magazines.  The covers shall be held closed using clips.  The clips shall be able to be tightened and loosened around the top of the magazines and be able to be opened/closed using one hand quickly and as quietly as possible.  The magazine pouch shall be able to be secured to the Soldiers MOLLIE vest and use a minimum amount of space on the MOLLIE vest.  The color pattern on the magazine pouch shall be the current ACU (uniform) camouflage pattern in accordance with  MIL-DTL-44436A, 19 April 2005.  The soft case shall hold one 12 gauge shotgun that is no smaller than 29in length and 10in tall with the 5-round magazine attached, weighing approximately 4 lb 3 oz/1.90 kg (not including the magazines and accessories).  The soft case shall have a carrying handle and a removable shoulder strap for carrying the soft case.  The soft case shall be made of durable, protective material and components suitable for field conditions.  The shotgun should be securable inside the soft case to prevent excessive movement.  The soft case shall also be able to hold five magazines (dimensions above) in any combination of 5-round and 3-round magazines, cleaning kit, shoulder strap and the magazine pouch.  The soft case shall be cushioned to prevent damage to the shotgun and its accessories if it is dropped.  The pattern on the soft case shall be the current camouflage pattern in accordance with MIL-DTL-44436A, 19 April 2005.

<DESC><p>CROWNWeb End Stage Renal Disease Data Validation</p>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of 8(a) businesses that can provide support to CMS for data validation of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (http://www.cms.gov/center/esrd.asp) administrative and clinical performance measure data. The CMS ESRD data collection system is known as CROWNWeb (Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web Enabled Network) Once nationally implemented, all dialysis facilities will submit both clinical and administrative data electronically to CROWNWeb in support of the updated Conditions for Coverage (CfCs) for ESRD dialysis facilities.</p>
<p>Within the confines of ESRD data, there is a minimum set of data elements related to three significant areas to support the data validation effort: patient information; Clinical Performance Measure (CPM) values; and the ESRD Medical Evidence Form (CMS Form 2728) and ESRD Death Notification (CMS Form 2746). Through validation of these core data elements, CMS will be able to achieve a successful model of facility compliance and data accuracy. Eventually CROWNWeb data will be important to calculation of facility-specific scores and percentage payment reductions to implement the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP) established under &sect;153(c) of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008.</p>
<p>HISTORY: CROWNWeb (http://projectcrownweb.org/crown/index.php) is a Web-based data-collection system that allows authorized users to securely submit and access patient-based data (both clinical and non-clinical) from virtually anywhere at any time. It is the tool designed by CMS to enable facilities to meet &sect;494.180(h) of the updated CfCs, published on April 15, 2008. This section outlines the electronic submission of administrative and clinical data by all Medicare-certified dialysis facilities in the United States - a move away from the current paper-based data-collection methods. CMS is leveraging this tool to streamline how the renal community will both report and access facility and patient data.</p>
<p>The system is being released to the renal community in phases to allow CMS to conduct user analyses, while providing future users an opportunity to complete the required account activation process via the QualityNet Identify Provisioning System (QIPS) Account Form. Now in the second stage of its phase-in implementation process, CROWNWeb is at present allowing CMS to review data for more than 280,587 dialysis patients, representing over 74% of the total ESRD population in the United States.</p>
<p>With the recent passage of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), CMS will launch the first ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP). Section 153(c) of MIPPA authorizes the establishment of a quality incentive payment program for ESRD providers, effective January 1, 2012. The provision requires providers of ESRD services to meet quality metrics endorsed by consensus-based, standard-setting bodies by demonstrating improvement or high levels of achievement. Those renal dialysis facilities that do not meet the specified requirements will receive a payment reduction of up to 2.0 percent, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p>The main objective of the QIP is to improve the quality of care for Medicare ESRD beneficiaries through a focus on efforts to improve pre-determined clinical measures in the dialysis facilities. Another is to accurately measure performance by determining a performance score. In order to successfully establish an accurate QIP performance score, a data validation effort must be completed. CMS must ensure that the QIP program utilizes accurate, correct and useful data, and ensure that the CROWNWeb data is valid by verifying that ESRD administrative and clinical database records match original source data.</p>
<p>CMS is conducting market research amount 8(a) vendor resources that may provide services to validate data entered in CROWNWeb, independent of the data submission process, and to determine the extent to which the ESRD database contains reliable and accurate administrative and clinical information. Typically, this would require a comparison of CROWNWeb data to original source data captured independently of CROWNWeb (e.g., the patient's medical record).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</p>
<p>The following services may be required over the phase-in period leading up to national implementation of the CROWNWeb data collection system:</p>
<p>1. Provide administrative, project management, and communications support requiring adherence to system and personnel security controls and data use agreements for access to CMS ESRD systems and CMS ESRD information.<br />2.

Build a sampling tool/program using SAS or a comparable robust statistical package, which provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), to select a minimum 10% random data sample from each facility participating in the CROWNWeb Phase. At the start of the contract, CMS anticipates about 360 participating faculties, which will increase to approximately 5500 participating facilities when CROWNWeb is fully implemented. Each facility will have a required minimum sample size of five (5) records selected, not to exceed a maximum of twenty-five (25) records selected.<br />7. Practice continuous process improvement that promotes root cause analysis, and advances innovation/change proposals for improved accuracy and efficiency in electronic data submission.<br />8. Develop and conduct an educational and program for project clinicians without nephrology experience that focuses on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis medical records.<br />9.

<p>Every Diabetic Counts<br />Hispanic/Latino/Native American Target Populations<br />State of Texas</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of 8(a) business that can provide support to CMS on behalf of the Every Diabetic Counts (EDC)/Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) administrative and clinical reporting requirements.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is an advocate for providing quality access to health care for its beneficiaries. As a result, CMS is currently engaged in agency-wide initiatives which encompass public and private partnerships to address and reduce health disparities nationwide. <br />Current Initiatives with Quality Improvement Organizations<br />The Every Diabetic Counts (EDC) program was launched on August 1, 2008. The program provides Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) training to Medicare beneficiaries. DSME is the ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for diabetes self-care. This process incorporates the needs, goals, and the life experiences of the person with diabetes and is guided by evidenced-based standards. The overall objectives of DSME are to support informed decision-making, self care behaviors, problem-solving, and active collaboration with the health care team to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life.<br />Present Mississippi Health First Initiative<br />As a result of successful efforts in the EDC Program, CMS initiated a similar program in a state that had significant numbers of underserved and rural populations and a high prevalence rate of diabetes as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state that fit this description was Mississippi. Consequently, the Mississippi Health First project was launched in October 2009.<br />The national Collaborative partners in the Mississippi Health First project include the Administration on Aging (AOA), American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Health Services and Resources Administration (HRSA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Academy of State Health Policy (NASHP). Local collaborative partners include federally qualified health centers, Area Agencies on Aging, private physician practices, community and faith based organizations, the University of Mississippi Medical Center and many others.<br />The Mississippi Health First initiative with combined efforts and resources from the Collaborative Partnership has the following goals: train Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and other patients with diabetes in the State of Mississippi; expand the number of the DSME trainers and certified sites; and establish and maintain partnerships in the community to sustain and expand this work over time. Together, CMS, its contractors, and national and state partners seek to train thousands of patients in diabetes self management.<br />The measures for success include: recruitment of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, other patients, and practicing physicians; retention of patients once enrolled in the DSME and training them to stick with the program; increased utilization measures; and improvement in outcome measures.<br />The collaborative experiences have been initiated with numerous organizations and statewide agencies including diabetes support groups, diabetes education and screening programs, district health officers, health care facilities, professional associations, non-profit health foundations, grocery and drug stores, and others. <br />In an effort to capitalize upon the success of the Mississippi Health First Initiative, CMS plans to conduct a similar program in the State of Texas, targeted to Hispanic/Latino and Native American underserved and rural populations with a high prevalence rate of diabetes.</p>
<p>CMS is now conducting market research among 8(a) vendor resources that may provide these services.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor is seeking qualified contractors that can provide data validation support activities undertaken by the Employment and Training Administration's (ETA).  We are looking for firms that qualify under the Small Business Programs mentioned in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 19.  When submitting your response, please indicate all programs under which you meet the criteria.  The proposed acquisition will be classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611, and the Small Business Standard is $7 million. 
ETA in supporting its goal to inform the Workforce Investment System of workforce policies and investments that support the continuous improvement of the public workforce investment system is seeking strategic approaches to validating information in the ETA Communication Database.  The Communication Database is accessible through the Americas Service Locator (ASL) website, contains contact information (names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc.) for over 20 key stakeholder groups in the workforce development system, and ETA relies on this database as an outreach tool to disseminate e-mail messages via an E-Blast system on various topics (policy guidance, special webinars, conferences, etc.) to the workforce development system. 

The contractor will be responsible for providing data validation management services for the ETA Communication Database.  Two data validation rounds will be completed in the base year, one per six month period, for a total of 12 months.  Two one-year options will follow in the same methodology of two rounds per 12 months at the Governments discretion.  Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for validating the data by gathering new and/or updating existing information for a variety of ETA Communication Database files, i.e., State and Local WIB Chairs, State and local WIB Executive Directors, Community College Presidents, Comprehensive One-Stop Operators, and State Workforce Administrators (see below for additional groups as well as approximate total counts per group).  The contractor must be able to validate the existing data, add discovered data to the data base, and prepare reports based on the analysis of data validated. 

All contractors responding to this announcement must demonstrate their experience in the aforementioned work.  Contractor will be evaluated on its ability to recruit, retain, and provide highly skilled qualified personnel, and its ability to provide appropriate staffing resources.  This section of the proposal shall include sufficient information for judging the quality and competence of staff proposed to be assigned to the project to assure that they meet the required qualifications.  Successful performance of the proposed work depends heavily on the qualifications of the individuals committed to this project, and the adequacy of the time commitment for each individual in relation to the specific tasks that they will perform.  Accordingly, the Government, in its evaluation of the contractor's proposal, will place considerable emphasis on the contractor's commitment of personnel qualified for the work involved in accomplishing the assigned tasks. 
  
Pertinent factors for consideration of qualifications are the primary contractor's ability to: 
(1)	Demonstrate a clear and concise understanding of the scope of work;
(2)	Maintain a comprehensive project plan;
(3)	Conduct internet searches to gather new and/or update existing information for different files involving the Workforce Investment System contacts, such as State and Local WIB Chairs and Executive Directors, Community College Presidents, Comprehensive One-Stop Operators, and State Workforce Administrators, etc;
(4)	Obtain information via web look ups, phone calls and an e-mail campaign;
(5)	Update records by directly inputting collected data into a database or entering incomplete records into an MS Excel spreadsheet; and
(6)	Provide detailed written monthly reports, as well as conduct bi-weekly calls regarding the status of the data verification.

All interested parties are invited to submit a capabilities statement, to Ms. Deborah Campbell, Contract Specialist, Division of Contract Services, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N4655, Washington, DC 20210.  Responses are due May 25, 2010 by 2 p.m. EST.  Electronic copies of capability statements are preferred and may be emailed to campbell.deborah@dol.gov .  The response must be specific to each of the qualifications listed above to demonstrate that the respondent has the skills and experience.  The submittals shall not exceed 10 pages, TOTAL.

<DESC>NASA investment of financial and technical resources to stimulate efforts withinthe private sector would aid in the development and demonstration of safe, reliable, andcost-effective space transportation capabilities.  In a multiphase strategy, the programwould help to spur the innovation and development of new spacecraft and launch vehiclesfrom the commercial industry, creating a new way of delivering cargo  and eventuallycrew  to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and the International Space Station (ISS).  As NASAretires the Space Shuttle, the ability of private industry to take on the task ofproviding routine access to space is of vital importance.  NASA is currently in the conceptual phase of developing requirements for a CommercialCrew Transportation (CCT) capability that would be able to transport NASA astronauts andspaceflight participants safely to and from LEO and the ISS.  The purpose of this RFI is to collect information from industry to help NASA plan theoverall strategy for the development and demonstration of a CCT capability and to receivecomments on NASA human-rating technical requirements that have been drafted as part ofthis initiative.  The draft CCT-1001, Commercial Human-Rating Plan (CHRP), defines the allocation ofresponsibilities, requirements, mandatory standards, and process for achieving NASA humanspaceflight certification for commercial crew transportation services in compliance withNPR 8715.3C, NASA General Safety Requirements, Chapter 1.14.  The CHRP draws heavily uponNPR 8705.2B, Human-Rating Requirements for Space Systems, as tailored for LEO CCTsystems.  Specific health and medical requirements tailored for commercial human systemsintegration, as well as system performance goals and objectives and additionalrequirements associated with ISS visiting vehicles are currently being developed and areplanned to be provided for comment at a later time.  The preliminary contents of the ISSServices Requirements Document (which will provide the system performance requirements,including the probability of Loss of Crew and Loss of Mission, for reference during thedevelopment and demonstration phase), the updated contents of SSP 50808, ISS to COTSInterface Requirements Document, as well as the CHRP and access to other applicable andreference documents are available under the technical library link athttp://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/cct/authorize.htm    .NASA is specifically requesting the following information:1.	Company name, point of contact name, phone number, e-mail address, and nature ofinterest in CCT. Provide sufficient information to determine if your company qualifies asa United States commercial provider of space transportation services as defined in PublicLaw 105-303, Commercial Space Act of 1998.2.	Discuss any aspects of the NASA documents contained in this RFI that result insignificant cost, schedule, or technical impacts to your companys CCT system.	Whatclarifications or suggestions do you propose to minimize impacts or improve designflexibility, safety, or reliability?  Provide rationale for any alternative suggestionsthat may meet or exceed the intent of these requirements and standards.  Comments on theallocation of responsibilities in Section 4 Tables II and III of the CHRP, as well as theproposed fault tolerance requirements (3.2.2 and 3.2.3) in Table III are of particularinterest.3.	NASA has entered into competitively awarded funded Space Act Agreements with U.S.commercial partners for the development and demonstration of Commercial OrbitalTransportation Services (COTS) cargo capabilities using pay for performance milestones. This was followed by a separate competitive procurement of ISS Commercial ResupplyService contracts.  From your perspective, what were the pros, cons, and limitations foreach of these approaches for both the initial development/demonstration phase and thefollow on purchase of services phase for CCT?  What changes or improvements do yousuggest to this strategy or its related terms and conditions for both the initialdevelopment/demonstration phase and the follow on purchase of services phase for CCT?4.	What is the approximate dollar magnitude of the minimum NASA investment necessaryto ensure the success of your companys CCT development and demonstration effort?  Whatis the approximate government fiscal year phasing of this investment from award tocompletion of a crewed orbital flight demonstration?  What percentage of the totaldevelopment cost would the NASA contribution represent?5.	What significant NASA furnished resources (equipment, facilities, material,services) would your company likely request to complete the CCT development anddemonstration?Additional background information on COTS may be found athttp://www.nasa.gov/offices/c3po/home/	  .This is a request for information only.

<DESC>The Maine Air National Guard, Bangor, ME, is seeking sources for 5 EA Wireless Emergency Call Boxes. Two way voice communication units shall be self-contained/powered, not requiring external power or communication wiring. It is the intent to have the units communicate through an existing Motorola Base Station, Model Number MC3000, at a command center. However, the government will consider other wireless alternatives that do not use existing equipment and may be more cost effective with equal communication quality or better. All transmissions must meet AES encryption standard. Equipment must not interfere with FAA or military aviation equipment at the Bangor International Air Port.

<SUBJECT>MONITOR FISH COMMUNITIES OF THE COASTAL WETLANDS OF BISCAYNE BAY
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-10-09603SLW
<RESPDATE>060110
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries, located in Miami, FL intends to acquire services to perform monitoring of the fish community of the coastal wetlands of Bisayne Bay.
<p>DESC: This is a notice to acquire services to perform monitoring of the fish community of the coastal wetlands of Bisayne Bay.</p>
<p>Objectives: Sampling will be conducted in the southern Biscayne Bay mainland coastal wetlands at four locations: Manatee Bay, Barnes Sound, Card Sound, and Turkey Point. Sampling will be conducted at least once at each location within the following periods for a complete year: January-April, June, September, November, and December. The methods of Lorenz et al. (1997) will be used. Sampling will be stratified between creek and flats (or deep and shallow areas in the case of freshwater wetland sites) because previous studies (Lorenz et al. 1997, Lorenz 1999) indicate that the abundance of demersal fishes differs between the two habitats.<br /><br />Scope<br />Description of the sampling and analysis tasks</p>
<p>A 9-m2 drop net method developed for sampling fish in the coastal creek/open wetland flats type of habitat will be used to sample small demersal fish effectively and without bias. Nets will be set up, left in place overnight, and deployed the following day within 2 hrs after sunrise. Each net will surround an individual dwarf mangrove tree, thereby sampling both prop-root habitat and the open area between trees. Trees for sampling will be selected so that each site has a similar array of tree sizes with roughly equivalent prop-root density sampled between sites. Six nets will be used during each sampling trip, three in each sub-habitat (flats and creek). Samples will be collected at each site eight times per hydrologic year (defined as June 1 to May 31) in June, September and monthly from November through April.</p>
<p>Fish will be cleared from the net using rotenone, a fish toxicant. As described by Lorenz et al. (1997), measures will be taken to avoid or minimize bi-kill. Fish missed in the initial collection day will be collected the following day when they float to the surface. Net clearing efficiencies will be estimated using mark and recapture techniques. Previous studies indicate that efficiency ranged from 78% to 90% for the most common fish species and averaged 86% for all marked and recaptured fish (Lorenz et al. 1997). All fish collected will be identified, weighed, and measured. Weights for specimens collected during the second collection day will be calculated from length-weight regressions generated from the first day's collection.</p>
<p>Water level (stage) and salinity will be recorded in order to relate changes in the fish community to changes in hydrology (Lorenz 1999). Dissolved oxygen, rainfall, and pH are other critical parameters to fish that will be monitored. Data will be received daily from the Hydrolab stations and will be maintained for analysis.</p>
<p>The data acquired from the above tasks will be entered into a database and files will be prepared for analysis. Analytical methods will include community analysis and ordination, multivariate analysis, ANOVA, and general linear modeling. Results of these analyses will be used to describe baseline characteristics and variability, identify plausible cause and effect relationships, and develop performance measures.</p>
<p><br />The minimum requirements:</p>
<p>Experience working with combination of 3 x 3 meter drop nets and rotenone.<br />Experience working in ecotone between mangroves and freshwater wetlands<br />Demonstrated ability to determine fish abundance in areas of fluctuating water levels.<br />Integration with ongoing sampling that uses the same method in the southern Everglades.<br />Experience in the operation, maintenance, and collection of data from established Hydrolabs at the study sites.<br />Demonstrated ability to relate fish dynamics to the dynamics of reproduction in roseate spoonbills.<br />Familiarity with reporting needs for system status reports for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project.</p>
<p>The government knows of only one source Tavernier Science Center (TSC) of Audubon of Florida, Dr. Jerome Lorenz capable of providing this service: Dr. Lorenz has been conducting research in south Florida on coastal fish communities in relation to water and salinity patterns since 1989 and has a dissertation and several scientific papers on the topic. Dr. Lorenz established 8 sampling stations in coastal wetlands of southeastern Florida, developed a sampling protocol, and has been applying is since 1990 at 5 stations. The sampling protocol that is required is unique and particularly applicable to coastal wetlands of south Florida, where sampling and analysis of the samples collected is extremely difficult due to the soft, highly fragile terrain and the fluctuating water levels that affect the estimation of faunal density. Dr. Lorenz is the only known researcher applying this protocol, which is logistically complex. This is a crucial need to begin the work immediately because a sampling schedule that include June and September, as well as November through April, it is necessary to obtain fully interpretable results by May 2011. Failure to complete this project on schedule would erode the NOAA relationship with other agencies participating in the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration effort and reduce NOAA's prestige in the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration community. Failure to complete the project on schedule could prevent NOAA from providing information to Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan ad the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project in time for the information to be used. The delay could also jeopardize the ability to define and protect Biscayne Bay's fresh water needs and allow further degradation of the Biscayne Bay ecosystem.</p>
<p>To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service, along with the individual work knowledge and experience.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries, Protected Resources Division, located in St. Petersburg, FL intends to acquire services for investigations into the population genetics of largetooth sawfish, Pristis perotteti .</p>
<p>DESC: This is a notice to acquire services for investigations into the population genetics of largetooth sawfish, Pristis perotteti</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />To investigate whether historically largetooth sawfish individuals were seasonal migrants or made up a US genetic breeding unit of the population of largetooth sawfish. The government will also make a range-wise assessment of population genetic diversity in the Western Atlantic basin, to examine the potential for a population bottleneck.</p>
<p><br />Scope<br />Proposed work:<br />Tissue samples from U.S. collected specimens of Pristis perotetti will be obtained from dried rostra archived in museum collections (N=41 have been confirmed in museums in the U.S.). Small (1 x 1 cm) pieces of each rostrum will be collected with a sterile razor blade. The sample will be thoroughly washed in water and alcohol prior to DNA extraction and only the internal part of the sample will be used. Samples of P. perotetti from Central America will be obtained from rostra held in museums and private collections. Samples from South America will be collected from wild captured specimens (V. Faria pers comm).</p>
<p>Genomic DNA will be isolated from all specimens using commercial kits and/or protocols described by Phillips et al. (2009) for obtaining genomic DNA from sawfish rostra. Two mitochondrial DNA loci (ND2, control region [CR]), that preliminary work has indicated are variable in P. perotetti, will be amplified using PCR in all specimens. In some cases we will attempt to amplify the whole locus in a single reaction, but in situations where genomic DNA is degraded due to age we will sequence these loci in 250-300 base pair segments to construct the whole locus (~1000 base pairs each) for every individual.</p>
<p>Sequences for ND2 and CR will be aligned and genetic diversity indices for the species will be calculated in DnaSP 4.0 (Rozas et al. 2003). A statistical parsimony network will also be constructed for the observed haplotypes in TCS 4.1 (Clement et al. 2000). Genetic differentiation (&Phi;ST; Jukes-Cantor distances) between the sampling sites and test of their significance will be calculated in Arlequin 2.001 (Schneider et al. 2000), using AMOVA. We will characterize haplotype and nucleotide diversity for each sampling region and determine whether U.S. specimens are genetically depauperate relative to the others. We will test the hypothesis that U.S. sampled specimens constitute either a set of distinct haplotypes from those observed in the Caribbean, South America and West Africa or that there are significant differences in haplotype frequencies between the U.S. and all other sampled regions.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor must possess a Ph.D in biological sciences or related fields and have conducted genetics research on elasmobranchs. The contractor must have demonstrated a record of publication of results in peer-reviewed journals particularly as it relates to the conservation genetics of sawfishes.</p>
<p>To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their education, experience and capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service. Interested parties must respond within (14) days after publication of this notice. The government knows of only one source Dr. Kevin A. Feldheim, Field Museum of Natural History that can provide this services. Dr. Feldheim has a decade of experience developing genetic markers for elasmobranchs and has published a large number of scientific articles in this research area. He has worked on the genetics of another sawfish (Pristis pectinata) developing microsatellite markers to study the population genectics of this species. He has also developed species-specific mitochondrial markers to aid in the conservation of this endangered elasmobranch. The timing is crucial to the government in making a final listing decision on the largetooth sawfish if the species is proposed for listing. Thus, timely completion of this project is imperative. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. Faxed information can be sent to 816-274-6983 or physically sent Department of Commerce, Attn: Sharon Walker ,601 E. 12th St, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106.

<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying sources that are capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with the requirements below.
<p>NMFS desires to contract for an occupied submersible and support vessel in waters off southern California. The submersible will be used to make visual observations and quantitatively survey demersal fishes, coral/sponge assemblages, and associated habitats on rocky offshore banks at depths of 80-350 m. There are two main objectives of this work: (1) to quantify habitat-specific abundance, size composition, and condition of corals and conduct surveys of fish associations with corals at various times of day and evening to quantify the function of corals as habitat for fishes on offshore rocky banks in the southern California Bight; and (2) to quantify species and size composition of demersal fishes and estimate habitat-specific abundance on an offshore rocky bank in the southern California Bight. A minimum of 6 dive-days (plus additional days to transit, and mobilize and demobilize scientists and equipment) will be required during September-October 2010, and a minimum of 8 dive-days (plus additional days to transit, and mobilize and demobilize scientists and equipment) will be required during September-October 2011.</p>
<p>Submersible Requirements. Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research. The total submersible system shall consist of an occupied submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, accurate tracking system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.</p>
<p>The submersible shall have the capability of carrying aboard at least one (1) NFMS Observer and one (1) Contractor provided pilot, and shall have viewing ports accessible to the observer during all portions of the dive. Contractor shall provide at least two (2) fully qualified pilots for the purpose of alternating dive participation, and one support crew member to assist with deck operations, and navigation, tracking, and communication with submersible (for a total of at least 3 submersible personnel).</p>
<p>The submersible shall be capable of regularly operating to a depth of 360 m sea water and must be able to operate in contact with the seafloor over rugged substrate that includes boulders, pinnacles and rockwalls. The submersible shall be certified American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), or recognized equivalent, to this depth, with appropriate documentation of inspection and construction.</p>
<p>The submersible and support crew shall be capable of providing 6-8 hours of submergence during a normal operating day, consisting of multiple dives. The submersible shall be highly maneuverable and capable of performing multiple dives per day while steaming at a minimum speed of 2 km/hour with external lights on and frequent use of external strobes. The submersible shall have a means to deploy and retrieve sampling gear and biological specimens.</p>
<p>Exterior lighting and illumination capable of providing sufficient light for video imaging of objects at a distance of at least 20 ft from the submersible at maximum operating depths is required. A through-hull electrical connection to the exterior strobes shall be provided for use with internal hand-held cameras. An external, high resolution color video camera capable of being mounted on the front or the side of the submersible in such a way as to generate high quality video record of transects, along the sea floor, with viewing angle adjustable from horizontal to vertical is required. The video system shall include an internal monitor, digital recording deck, and have datalogger capability (PISCES design or similar) encoded with synchronous data on time, date, and depth. The video system will include externally mounted multiple lasers for measuration purposes. In addition, the submersible will be outfitted with a recently calibrated CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) and altimeter sensor that are linked to an operational data logging system. All CTD and navigation data will be provided to chief scientist each evening as digital ASCII-format files.</p>
<p>The submersible shall be capable of carrying and using a Doppler velocity log and Ring Laser Gyro that will enable the determination of the exact distance traveled by the submersible. This equipment will be installed by submersible personnel in a manner that does not interfere with the conduct of fish surveys.</p>
<p>The submersible shall have communication equipment (i.e., underwater submersible to support vessel-surface communication). Minimum range for such equipment (underwater model) shall be one-half mile. During surface operations, the submersible must have a means for visual contact (functional strobe and locating beacon as a minimum). The submersible's Contractor shall have an operations procedure manual including emergency procedures and safety precautions. All observers/scientists will be briefed on these safety procedures and precautions prior to diving. Submersible supplies should include air/regulator for pilot and scientist; insulated emergency suits for prolonged submergence. The life support system (02 + C02 scrubber) systems of the submersible must be capable of supporting submersible occupants for at least 72 hours at an ambient temperature range of one (1) to twelve (12) degrees centigrade.</p>
<p>The submersible shall have a functional acoustic tracking beacon for acquisition of depth/range from the support ship (e.g., Trackpoint II type and Winfrog, or equivalent). The operator of this equipment will need to precisely track the submersible transects, and provide a digital ASCII-formatted file of navigational data synchronized with time for each transect. Precision of these navigational data is critical to the success of our project.</p>

The purpose of this combined Sources Sought is to 1) identify potential vendors to meet a need of the United States Special Operations Command for a Thermal Laser Pointer (TLP) and 2) notify industry that NSWC Crane may procure up to 36000 units.
This acquisition is for a laser product that provides aiming and pointing capability in the 8-12 micron wavelength range, or long wave infrared band (LWIR), for users with LWIR sensors.  The TLP should be mountable to the rail system of the M-4 Carbine without obscuring the optics.  The TLP is meant to augment or replace the current NIR AN/PEQ-2A systems.
The white paper in response to this notification, should address in detail how the manufacturer intends to meet the LWIR requirement and future requirements in the Mid-Wave IR and Short-Wave IR bands.  Summary of the firm's capabilities needs to address as a minimum the following:
1.  An executive summary of the firm's capability and experience in pointer technology.  Additional information in the executive summary should include a discussion of the proposed solution to NSWC Crane's requirements to include; proposed product maturity*, current status of proposed product (concept, brass board, engineering model, in production)*, any test results if applicable, pictures if applicable, and product literature. 
2.  Matrix that includes performance characteristics including expected range, power requirements, beam divergence, output power, wavelength, weight, and +dimensions.  
3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for units to include applicable quantity breaks up to 2000.
*Note: It is NSWC Crane's intention to rapidly review the information received under this sources sought notification and proceed to issue a Request for Proposal.  It is extremely important for companies to identify the level of maturity of their proposed solution.
Responses are due by Noon (12:00PM) Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT) on April 1, 2010.  All responses shall include company's administrative information in addition to the technical detail requested above.
All responses must be sent electronically (Microsoft 2003 compatible) to the Technical Point of Contact:  Mr. Matt Thurner, matthew.thurner@navy.mil, telephone number (812)854-2383. 

NSWC Crane anticipates conducting an industry day on April 15, 2010 to provide company(s) the opportunity to provide a technical presentation (no more than 30 minutes in length).

<DESC>The Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security has implemented a U.S. card-format passport; a credit-card-size travel document.  The Passport Card is an accepted alternative to the traditional book style passport for presentation at U.S. land and sea border crossings.  

The U.S. Department of State is conducting market research to determine the degree of interest and capability by small businesses only in providing steganography services for the Bureau of Consular Affairs.  The small business would be responsible for developing a card security feature that uses applicant data and steganography to provide a unique authentication method, using secure software that enables embedding a Department of State derived string of characters into the printing of the bearers photograph so that no string is detectable without decoding, but the string is readily seen with decoder, without otherwise effecting the applicant data or the rest of the personalization printing.  The NAICS code for this service is 541511.

Responses must clearly demonstrate capabilities through examples of previous and/or current software development contract experience closely related thereto.  Vendors must specifically address the following capabilities (capability statement), which is limited to five pages:

Experience in developing steganography software;

Examples of customers that have used their software successfully; examples of technical support and engineering services;

Demonstration of capability of providing software services, maintenance and upgrades to permit ongoing services such as passport card personalization;

Experience providing personalization software that runs on MX6000 printer computers, High Volume or Low to Mid Volume platforms;

Experience providing decoders that reveal coding in the product that is invisible without them;

Experience providing priority on-call remedial maintenance support with a four hour response time and experience in providing operational training.

It is requested that small businesses submit their capability statement by e-mail addressing each of the above requirements by 11:30 am, June 1, 2010.  The e-mail address for your capability statement is CareyDA@state.gov.

<h4 style="tab-stops: .5in"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Background:</span></span></h4>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Currently, network security implementation is to use a variety of agents installed on host machines, including agents for Anti-Virus (AV), Anti-Spyware (AS), Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS), Network Access Control (NAC), rootkit detection, device control, configuration auditing, configuration management, and patch management. To simplify the task of managing these agents and the policies and behaviors applied through these agents, security software vendors have recently started packaging these capabilities to utilize Common Management Frameworks (e.g. McAfee ePO is the common management framework that manages McAfee AV, AS, HIPS, etc).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This framework provides a system administrator improved network operations efficiency and a cyber commander consolidated situational awareness of all agents on a host from one management console instead of an individual console for each agent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">While this Common Management Framework (CMF) has reduced the level of resources required to manage a portfolio of security agents, it reduces the freedom of organizations to select "best of breed" security products to address individual requirements for specific host-based agents-decisions instead are based on whether a vendor is integrated into the current management framework or which vendor is best integrated.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">For example:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are many different vendors' Anti-Virus (AV) solutions out in the market place. Most vendors' AV products are based on propriety agent-server architectures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The AV agent is installed on a host machine and communicates to a server to obtain the latest definition update.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A different vendor's AV agent would not be able to communicate with and be managed by a different vendor's AV server.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This poses several challenges to a large enterprise such as the DoD, of which smaller components have unique operational requirements that a single vendor AV solution cannot optimally fulfill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">To address these limitations, some integrated solution vendors have started to work with other security companies to integrate other vendors products, or have created integration programs to allow other vendors to integrate products into their proprietary framework. While this has improved the marketplace, integrated solution vendors still have an upper hand as they control the level of supported integration, reserving access to some framework features for their own products; furthermore, integrated solution vendors can control access to framework integration by charging fees for licensing or integration testing. In addition, frameworks can limit the functionality of the agents attached to them. </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">DISA currently has an HBSS solution that includes a variety of host-based security capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current capability is provided by McAfee with a proprietary framework and integrated capabilities. The goal of this RFI is to determine the feasibility of a future acquisition of an "Open Architecture" framework for host-based security solutions.</p>
<h4 style="tab-stops: .5in"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Desired Capability:</span></span></h4>
<p>The Government's desired capability is an HBSS open architecture solution that is available to all vendors and capability developers, that would promote a competitive, level marketplace for individual host-based security products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This would allow individual host-based security capabilities to be independently developed or acquired, but seamlessly integrated into an open framework with minimum to zero modification. The Government would like industry to provide innovative and cost effective alternatives. The Government envisions solutions taking the form of an existing architecture for system management; or host security with an unrestricted Application Program Interface (API) for integration; a set of standards for consolidated management of independent host security tools; an open source management framework; or any other solution that provides consolidated management of host security tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical requirements of a HBSS open architecture solution would include:</p>

Sources Sought and Pre Qualification Notice - Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter (APBS).  

Description

The USPS is considering potential sources to upgrade many of the existing fleet of Small Parcel Bundle Sorter (SPBS) machines.  This upgrade will be performed by providing each location with a kit of SPBS upgrade parts which will be installed at each site.  The upgraded SPBS will be called the Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter (APBS).  The APBS parts will be integrated into the APBS "Build Kit.  This FedbizOpps announcement is for the sourcing, purchase, aggregation and shipping of theses upgrade APBS Build Kits.  It is anticipated that each APBS Build Kit will be customized per USPS needs and will be packaged and shipped within the United States.

Background

The USPS is increasing productivity of its package processing operations by deploying automated package and bundle sortation equipment.  Existing SPBS machines will be upgraded with the APBS Build Kit.  Current USPS estimate of the number of APBS Build kits is between 100 and 200 APBS Build Kits to a projected 100 to 200 USPS sites.

The objective of this notice is to gather information from current sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  The USPS may use information gathered through this announcement to pre-qualify multiple sources for the opportunity to submit a proposals for possible future solicitations.

The APBS Build Kits will be shipped freight on board (FOB) destination to designated USPS sites by the APBS Build Kit supplier.  It is anticipated that 10 kits will be delivered to USPS sites every two weeks for installation.

Pre-qualification Process

Pre-qualification is a process whereby a suppliers ability to meet specific USPS requirements is evaluated.  A purchase team will review and evaluate documentation submitted by interested suppliers in accordance with the evaluation factors listed in this announcement.  To receive credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all the requirements and submit adequate documentation.  Failure to address an item or submit the required documentation will reflect negatively in the evaluation scoring.

After the purchase team review and analyze supplier responses based on information requested in this pre-qualification process, suppliers may be placed on the pre-qualified list.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team decides (1) a smaller group will provide adequate competition, or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for the less qualified.
During this process, each prospective supplier can be assured of the following:
1.	All suppliers will be treated fairly and objectively
2.	The inclusion or exclusion of a particular supplier will be based on business decisions alone and will be judged solely on the predetermined pre-qualification criteria.
3.	A sufficient number of suppliers will be placed on the list to ensure adequate completion for subsequent purchases.
4.	Any sensitive business information provided by a supplier will be sufficiently protected from disclosure.

The pre-qualification process does not constitute an assurance that a subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  However, when, or if a RFP is issued, it will be provided to those suppliers on the pre-qualification list.  Should an RFP be issued, it may or may not result in an award, and the Postal Service reserves the right to make more than one award to procure the services required.  The USPS may elect to use the information received in the responses to this pre-qualification process to satisfy subsequent business needs. 

Late Submissions

Any document received at the office designated in the pre-qualification package after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before the evaluation takes place, and:

Sources Sought and Pre Qualification Notice - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to support parcel and bundle sorting automation equipment

Description

The USPS is considering potential sources to upgrade many of the existing fleet of Small Parcel Bundle Sorter (SPBS) machines.  This upgrade will be performed by providing each location with a kit of SPBS upgrade parts which will be installed at each site.  The upgraded SPBS will be called the Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter (APBS).  The APBS parts will be integrated into the APBS "Build Kit.  This FebizOpps announcement is for the sourcing, purchase, aggregation, and shipping of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to support parcel and bundle sorting automation equipment.  It is anticipated that each APBS OCR System Kit will be customized per USPS needs and will be packaged and shipped within the United States.

Background

The USPS is increasing productivity of its package processing operations by deploying automated package and bundle sortation equipment.  A central focus of this effort is OCR and bar code recognition (BCR) platforms.  APBS is designed to perform address recognition, barcode visibility, and revenue protection functions on packages and bundles.  

The objective of this notice is to gather information from current sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  The USPS may use information gathered through this announcement to pre-qualify multiple sources for the opportunity to submit a proposals for possible future solicitations.

Pre-qualification Process

Pre-qualification is a process whereby a suppliers ability to meet specific USPS requirements is evaluated.  A purchase team will review and evaluate documentation submitted by interested suppliers in accordance with the evaluation factors listed in this announcement.  To receive credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all the requirements and submit adequate documentation.  Failure to address an item or submit the required documentation will reflect negatively in the evaluation scoring.

After the purchase team review and analyze supplier responses based on information requested in this pre-qualification process, suppliers may be placed on the pre-qualified list.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team decides (1) a smaller group will provide adequate competition, or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for the less qualified.

During this process, each prospective supplier can be assured of the following:
1.	All suppliers will be treated fairly and objectively
2.	The inclusion or exclusion of a particular supplier will be based on business decisions alone and will be judged solely on the predetermined pre-qualification criteria.
3.	A sufficient number of suppliers will be placed on the list to ensure adequate completion for subsequent purchases.
4.	Any sensitive business information provided by a supplier will be sufficiently protected from disclosure.

The pre-qualification process does not constitute an assurance that a subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  However, when, or if a RFP is issued, it will be provided to those suppliers on the pre-qualification list. Those pre-qualified suppliers will be required to agree to a Non Disclosure Agreement prior to receipt of the potential USPS RFP.  Should an RFP be issued, it may or may not result in an award, and the Postal Service reserves the right to make more than one award to procure the services required.  The USPS may elect to use the information received in the responses to this pre-qualification process to satisfy subsequent business needs. 

Late Submissions

Any document received at the office designated in the pre-qualification package after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before the evaluation takes place, and:
a.	It is the only submission received; or
b.	Consideration of the submission is determined by the contracting officer to be in the Postal Services interest.

Requirements

Potential sources must have the ability to provide an address recognition platform utilizing OCR and BCR capabilities in a real-time environment.  This recognition platform must accept grayscale images from an industrial camera application and output decoded barcode data, binarized images, and finalized address information based on an address directory database.  This platform must be capable of integration with third party camera systems and arbitration systems using either open interfaces or USPS-proprietary interfaces.  An estimated 200 mail processing machines will require local integration of this platform.  

The Supplier must show the ability to obtain, provide, and support this image recognition platform.  The ability to provide technical support after deployment must be demonstrated by the Supplier.  

The platform must be capable of meeting minimum performance requirements, including minimum recognition required accept rate of approximately 60% of non-barcoded mail and error rate of 1.0 % or less of accepts within a time limitation of less than 1,000ms from image acquisition.



Pre-qualification Evaluation Criteria

Potential sources seeking consideration are those that can address the following:
1.	Performance Capability:  Provide information demonstrating that your company has the necessary organization, experience, operational controls and other technical skills necessary to ensure superior performance and fulfillment of system requirements.
2.	Current and Past Performance:  Document a minimum of three (3) years experience in projects of similar size and scope.  Provide no fewer than three (3) references addressing relevant past performance and experience performing work of comparable scope, complexity and relevance to the pre-qualification requirements. 
3.	Integration Capability:  Demonstrate your ability to integrate OCR systems with third-party systems, including camera systems, arbitration units, video coding systems, and secondary OCR systems.
4.	Quality Systems:  Document your quality control system, including quality controls on subcontractors, if applicable.  Describe your quality assurance process.  Elaborate on your ISO-9000 compliance.
5.	Financial Responsibility: Supplier must provide sufficient information that a positive determination can be made that they have sufficient resources/operating capital ensure successful contract performance.  Financial information to include but is not limited to and is to be no older that 60 days from submittal
	Certified defined balance sheet

The Department of Veterans Affairs is looking for firms that are classified under one or more of the following socio-economic programs:  SDVOSB, VOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, and/or WOSB.  Firms must be a PLUMBING/MECHANICAL firm registered in CCR as a small business under the NAICS Code of 238220 and must demonstrate that they have the bonding capacity for a contract award between $500,000 and $1M.  The firms must also demonstrate their capability of performing 25% of the total work with their own forces.  The intent of this project is to replace approximately 60 failing domestic hot and cold water knife gate isolation valves with high performance ball valves.   The areas of work include the 10th floor mechanical room which contains valves serving the buildings center core domestic water risers, the 9th floor west wing which is home to the medical center's billing department and contains the west wing domestic water risers, and the 9th floor east wing which is home to the medical center's patient hotel and contains the east wing domestic water risers.   
All of the valves within the 10th floor mechanical room are readily accessible with an 8-10ft stepladder.  The valves in the 9th floor west wing are accessible above an 8ft high acoustical tile ceiling grid.  The valves in the 9th floor east wing are accessible above an 8ft high metal pan ceiling system.  The project includes an alternate to replace the portions of the metal pan ceiling system affected by the valve replacement work with an acoustical tile ceiling system.  To minimize patient care, most of the work for this project will be accomplished between the hours of 8pm and 6am, Monday through Friday.
All existing domestic hot and cold water piping systems are rigid copper.  The piping and valve sizes range from " to 6" and include two no longer readily manufactured ball valve sizes (3-1/2" and 5") which are intended to be replaced with the next readily available sizes (4" and 6").  To minimize the potential for fire, smoke, and odors, press-to-seal pipe joints shall be used wherever possible.  

The proposed solicitation for this work (competitive RFP) is planned for issue possibly in fourth quarter of FY 10 or early FY 11.  Firms having the skills, qualifications and capabilities to perform this work are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey effort to assist in planning for the method of procurement.  Responses must include 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address, 5. DUNS Number, 6. Evidence of Bonding Capacity provided by Surety, 7. Construction Experience as a Prime Contractor for Similar Size Projects and Complexity, 8. Demonstration of Capability of Performing 25% of the Work with their own forces.

This is NOT a Request for Proposals and the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only.  Firms failing to respond to this Request for Information will not be precluded from responding to the solicitation when issued.  Firms responding to this RFI will need to respond again to a future separate FBO announcement of the anticipated procurement action in order to receive the solicitation documents.

<DESC>This is an Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation request for proposals or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information. Responders to the RFI must address each of the listed requirements. If a vendor's software tool does not already support one or more of the requirements, but can be modified to do so in a timely manner, that will, in and of itself, not be a disqualification from consideration. This is not a custom development project and a non-Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or GOTS solution will NOT be accepted. If a vendor has several software tools that, when integrated together, satisfy all requirements, the Government will give consideration to the vendor's proposed solution.<br /><br />The Healthcare Informatics Division (HID) of the Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA) is soliciting government, industry and academia for a high quality software tool for encryption and de-identification of protected healthcare information in a large and dynamic healthcare research clinical data repository environment.<br /><br />The specific requirements for this software are as follows:<br /><br />1. Security of the de-identification method<br />The software should de-identify data in accordance with both HIPAA and ISO accepted standards, with a minimum probability of re-identification by unauthorized personnel.<br />The pertinent sections of HIPAA are embodied by Public Law 111-5 Section 13402 and Public Law 104-191 Section 264 as implemented by the Code of Federal Regulations Title 45--Public Welfare, Subtitle A--Department Of Health And Human Services, Part 164-Security and Privacy, Subpart A-General Provisions, and Subpart E-Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information.<br />The international standard for PHI is embodied in ISO Technical Standard (ISO/TS) 25237:2008.<br /><br />2. Capability for re-identification<br />The software should provide the capability for automated re-identification by authorized personnel when required.<br /><br />3. Retention of data integrity after de-identification<br />Software must retain the integrity of internal data relationships after de-identification. e.g. If a patient number is used to relate two records for the same patient, the de-identification of that specific patient number must be consistently the same to maintain the integrity of the patient's records.<br />Since the data may represent treatments that have both start and stop dates, the software must have the ability to retain the appropriate date spans for the data to be useful in many research studies.<br /><br />4. Retention of data format after de-identification<br />Software must retain the native formats of the data after de-identification. In other words, a numeric 9-digit SSN should continue to be a 9-digit numeric value. This prevents the need for redesign and redevelopment of existing databases and applications in order to use the software.<br /><br />5. Encryption<br />The software should support identity-based field-level encryption using AES (IBSE) in compliance with FIPS 140-2, and include tools to enable symmetric key management and data decryption.<br /><br />6. Seamless Integration<br />The software must integrate seamlessly into the ongoing operation of the U.S Air Force Medical Support Agency Healthcare Informatics Division's Healthcare Informatics Data Warehouse environment. This environment makes use of Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Cache databases and the Informatica ETL tool. With approximately 40 TB of data, provision must be made for in-situ de-identification of data in the databases without unloading and reloading during initial integration.<br /><br />7. Ease of use and learning curve associated with the software<br />Any automated software tool for de-identification should require a minimum of overhead and present a short learning curve to be effectively accepted for use. Its use should be as unobtrusive to the normal workflow as possible.<br /><br />Responses shall be limited to no more than 20 pages, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents. Each response must address all requirements stated. In addition, responses should include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) technology concept(s) and associated performance, cost and risk parameters; (b) respondent's stated assumptions; (c) technology maturity; (d) cost drivers; and (e) other programmatic and technical information respondents deem necessary top aid the government in its program planning, decision making, and execution. Also include information such as: Company name, address, e-mail, telephone number, points of contact, and size of business pursuant to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 511210, Software Publishers, Small Business Standard of $25 million.<br /><br />Upon review of all submissions in response to this RFI, AFMSA/HID may schedule individual meetings with any or all respondents to gain further understanding of their specific responses.<br /><br />Responses shall be submitted no later than 3:00 PM CST on 7 June 2010 to points of contacts listed below. All responses shall be transmitted electronically. Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office software applications.<br /><br />Additional information: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response to this RFI synopsis or any future requests. Any information submitted in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information. All documentation shall become the property of the Government.

<p>Synopsis<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Foresight and Understanding from Scientific Exposition (FUSE) Program on 17 June 2010, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm EDT in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on FUSE, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities. This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>Program Description and Goals<br />The globalization of science and technology (S&amp;T) means that technical capabilities can emerge from diverse technical areas anywhere in the world. The FUSE Program will explore theories and models for the detection of significant technical capability emergence that can be observed from the worldwide scientific, technical, and patent literatures. FUSE will develop and test quantitative techniques that scan the full-length technical text across a large number of documents for time-dependent, pattern-based signals within a wide range of technical areas and multiple human languages. The Program will include empirical testing against examples of real-world capability emergence.</p>
<p>The FUSE Program will build upon substantial prior research and development in diverse technical areas, including: information extraction, machine learning, classification, clustering, time series summarization and analysis, network analysis, graph theory, statistical inference, technology forecasting, research and development management, business innovation, diffusion of innovation and market dynamics, bibliometrics and scientometrics, history of science, sociology of science, and psychology of science and emergence. <br /><br />Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with expertise in the areas outlined above. IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this research.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 4:00pm EDT, 10 June 2010, at https://conference.brtrc.com/FUSE_pd.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION:

The purpose of this announcement is to notify the commercial market of the Governments intent to award a sole source modification to extend Contract TIRWR-05-C-00002 for an additional six (6) months until the competitive source selection for the new follow-on contract can be completed.  The extension will provide for continuation of uninterrupted services.  This requirement will be made on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. These services include armed security guard services set forth under the existing contract with C&D Security Management, Inc. located at 306 N. Delaware Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80909, Contract Number TIRWR-05-C-00002.  The period of performance of this extension is June 1, 2010 through November 30, 2010.

Additional costs would include but not limited to the purchase of new equipment, uniforms, vehicles, licensing, physicals, drug screening and any start-up costs.

This notice to extend the existing contract award should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ) or contract.  Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary.  Responses to this notice will not serve as proposals, bids or offers which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  As such, the Government will not cover any cost for any information or inquiry submitted as a result of this notice.  A SOLICITATION DOES NOT EXIST.

Notice Number: RFI 61677
Key Dates:Issue Date: 5/21/10Response Due Date: 5/28/10 by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard TimePlease ensure your e-mail response has "RFI # 61677" in the subject line. 
Issued by:The Department of Interior's NBC Acquisition Services Directorate - Herndon on behalf of the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandusa 

RFI Objective:
In accordance with FAR 15.201 - Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals and FAR 5.205(c) - Special Notices, the Government is seeking market research, sources sought, and general industry information to aid in finalizing a statement of work or objectives requirements document which will be included in an upcoming solicitation.  The projected RFQ/RFP will solicit submissions leading to an award to study and report on the short and long-term economic impact and social benefits arising from the FY09 and FY10 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5, 123 Stat. 115, 512-13 (2009) (Recovery Act).)  BTOP grant awards.  If and when a future study analysis requirement is issued, it will be advertised in accordance with Recovery Act requirements and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site at FedBizOpps.gov (FBO.gov).
The Government is asking for interested qualified firms to review this notice and respond as stated under the "How to Respond" section of this document.
Purpose and Requirement Information:
The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) of the NTIA is planning to conduct an evaluation study that will qualitatively and quantitatively assess BTOP's benefits and overall impact.  
Given the purpose of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act or ARRA) to stimulate the economy in the near-term and provide long-term economic growth, NTIA is interested in conducting a thorough assessment of the benefits that BTOP grant awards are having on broadband availability and adoption, and in achieving economic and social benefits in areas served by the grantees. 
The assessment should also seek to inform the Federal Government on its consideration of the return on investment from BTOP grant funding, as well as identifying factors influencing performance and impact that can be used to inform future private and/or public sector investments.  More specifically, NTIA seeks to measure and assess the benefits of BTOP investments in the areas where they serve; it is not the purpose of this study to measure nationwide changes in broadband adoption, availability, or other macroeconomic outcomes.
Accordingly, the BTOP is soliciting input from those who undertake economic impact analyses, including stakeholders from research institutions, academia, the broadband community, and others, about the scope of evaluation studies regarding BTOP's impact on broadband availability and adoption as well as its economic and social benefits.

Background:
The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the President's principal adviser on telecommunications and information policy issues and in this role frequently works with other Executive Branch agencies to develop and present the Administration's positions on these issues.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided NTIA with $4.7 billion to support the deployment of broadband infrastructure, enhance and expand public computer centers, encourage sustainable adoption of broadband service, and develop and maintain a nationwide public map of broadband service capability and availability.  The Recovery Act instructed NTIA to implement the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program to promote five core purposes:a. To provide access to broadband service to consumers residing in unserved areas of the country;b. To provide improved access to broadband service to consumers residing in underserved areas of the country;c. To provide broadband education, awareness, training, access, equipment, and support to:  (i) schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, community colleges and other institutions of higher learning, and other community support organizations; (ii) organizations and agencies that provide outreach, access, equipment, and support services to facilitate greater use of broadband services by vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income, unemployed, aged); or (iii) job-creating strategic facilities located in state- or federally-designated economic development zones;d. To improve access to, and use of, broadband service by public safety agencies; ande. To stimulate the demand for broadband, economic growth, and job creation. 
In facilitating the expansion of broadband infrastructure and adoption of broadband services, NTIA aims to advance the objectives of the Recovery Act to spur job creation and stimulate economic growth and opportunity.  Additionally, NTIA seeks to fund projects that will provide long-term economic and social benefits, including improvements to healthcare delivery, education, innovation, and the Nation's global competitive position.   
NTIA has issued two Notices of Funds Availability (NOFAs), copies of which are available at www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandusa, outlining the objectives, rules, and processes that will govern the award and administration of BTOP grants.  As described in these documents in greater detail, BTOP has three types of awards for broadband investment:
- Infrastructure [including Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI)]:  Projects to deploy new or improved broadband Internet facilities (e.g., laying new fiber-optic cables, upgrading wireless towers) to connect households, businesses and "community anchor institutions" such as schools, libraries, hospitals, and public safety facilities. Infrastructure projects funded by BTOP include middle mile or last mile projects.  CCI projects are middle mile broadband infrastructure projects that offer new or substantially-upgraded service to community anchor institutions and can include a last mile infrastructure component. 
- Public Computer Centers (PCC):  Projects to establish new public computer facilities or upgrade existing ones that provide broadband access to the general public or to specific vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals, the unemployed, seniors, children, minorities, and people with disabilities.
- Sustainable Broadband Adoption (SBA):  Projects to provide a focus on increasing broadband Internet usage and adoption, including projects among vulnerable populations where broadband technology traditionally has been underutilized. Many projects include digital literacy training and outreach campaigns to increase the relevance of broadband in the public's everyday lives.
As of May 2010,  NTIA has awarded 82 BTOP grants totaling $1.2 billion, with nearly half of the awards applied to Infrastructure projects (predominantly middle mile).   NTIA's priority has been to fund projects that enhance broadband connections to anchor institutions such as schools, libraries, health care facilities, and other entities.  
NTIA's Round Two of funding, launched on January 22, 2010, allocated approximately $2.6 billion for grants across PCC, SBA, and CCI project categories.  The Recovery Act requires that all BTOP grants be obligated by September 30, 2010 and that BTOP projects be substantially complete within two years of the award date.  The Program's rules require projects to be fully complete within three years of the award date.  
Data about the grantees' performance will be made available through quarterly and annual Progress Reports that will be published via www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandusa.  These reports will include, among other things, detailed progress in achieving broadband infrastructure deployment milestones, connections to community anchor institutions, homes, and businesses, public computer workstations made available to the public, and the number of broadband subscribers generated by BTOP's sustainable broadband adoption projects.  In addition, grantees will report information about their use of funds and jobs created, among other requirements, via www.recovery.gov.  These data and performance measures will be among the inputs useful in conducting the assessment.

Request for Information and Market Research:
I.  Program Information:
1.  Briefly describe the types of research study designs and economic impact analytic approaches that would be useful for evaluating the BTOP program's effectiveness.
2.  As described previously, NTIA must award all BTOP grants by September 30, 2010.  Projects must be substantially complete within two years of the award date and fully complete within three years of the award.  Considering these timeframes, briefly describe evaluation approaches that will help to measure the near-term as well as the long-term benefits of BTOP investments.  Based on your firm's experience, what approach, method, and program areas would be beneficial to study for program evaluation?  What types of benefits are reasonable to expect in the near-term (1-2 years from the award date), and what benefits should be expected long-term (2-5 years from award date or beyond)?
3.  NTIA expects to award more than 200 grants by September 30, 2010.  Given that number, would you propose to evaluate every grant or a sample of total grants?  If the latter (other than evaluating 100% of the recipients), describe a sampling methodology and approach to yield a representative sample of awards to be used for an assessment which takes into account geographic location, type of award, and other relevant factors.  Explain how the assessment should incorporate case studies of BTOP projects and the areas they benefit and or impact.  
4.  List potential approaches you would recommend to incorporating both quantitative as well as qualitative approaches to measuring BTOP benefit and or impact in the study.
5.  Given NTIA's priority of awarding infrastructure grants that enhance broadband capabilities for anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, libraries and other entities, please indicate approaches that would measure both the economic impacts of BTOP projects as well as the social benefits of BTOP projects, such as on healthcare, education, innovation, and public safety, as well as other appropriate objectives that have been identified in the Recovery Act.  Describe an approach to gathering relevant data from anchor institutions benefitting from BTOP investments.
6.  Identify your recommended methods of measuring the benefit and or impact in communities that have received BTOP investments against baseline communities that did not receive BTOP funds.
7.  Describe the skills, qualifications, and experiences that NTIA should consider in evaluating proposals for undertaking such a study. 

The following items (8-11) will not count against the 10 page limitation for your firm's response to this RFI: 
8.  List what data collection instruments exist to measure relevant factors at various levels. If possible, please cite specific instruments and their sources. Also identify any possibly new data collection instruments that might help inform such an assessment.
9.  Identify strategies that could be used to assure that government-funded research conducted here can create tools, data sets and methodologies that can be used by other researchers in the field on an open-access basis.
10.  Provide input on the deliverables NTIA should expect at the conclusion of the assessment (approximately four years from start date), as well as interim milestones and deliverables that should be expected from the study.
11.  Describe any other information you feel would be helpful in designing this study.
The following items under the Business and Acquisition Information section will not count against the 10 page limitation for your firm's response to this RFI:
II.  Business and Acquisition Information: 
1.  Does your firm specialize in preparing research studies similar to this project's scope?  Briefly explain. 
2.  Does your firm have broadband technology experience?
3.  Does your firm have economic analysis experience?
4.  Does your firm currently hold a GSA Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) Schedule 874-1?  Also, if you have another GSA schedule that can be utilized for this requirement, please identify it.
5.  Is your firm a small business?  If so, what socio-economic category is the firm registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) web site (CCR.gov or https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/)?
6.  As the total benefit will not be received by the Government until a final report or deliverable has been accepted, the Government is planning to execute this requirement as a non-severable project.  Please identify the most advisable payment schedule and or structure for such an assessment.  Given a projected level of effort, would your firm be interested in performing this study as a fixed-priced, fixed-price level of effort, time and materials or a hybrid award type.

On April 27, 2010, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) commenced a joint investigation into the accident.  The joint investigation is to complete a report to the Director of the Minerals Management Service and the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard within nine months of its initiation, unless more time is necessary to complete the report.  DOI and DHS have encouraged the investigation team to submit interim recommendations intended to prevent similar casualties, if appropriate, early in the joint investigation.
Requirement:  The National Academy of Engineering will conduct an independent, technical investigation to determine the root causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster so that corrective steps can be taken to address the mechanical failures underlying the accident.  The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) is a highly-regarded and respected organization affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). Its projects, like those of the NAS, are implemented by the Academies' operating arm, the National Research Council (NRC). Its project teams are composed of members of the NAE and other experts from academia, industry, and - when appropriate - from government. The team members are unpaid experts throughout the world with knowledge and expertise in various engineering disciplines. Similar, independent investigations have been conducted of events like the space shuttle Challenger accident. NAE and NAS analyses and technical investigations often lead to results and findings that have had enormous impact on future policy decisions.  The independent NAE analysis and technical investigation will complement -- but not replace -- the on-going joint investigation that the USCG and MMS are conducting under their respective governmental investigative authorities. 
The period of performance for this effort is for 12 to 18 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by May 28th, 2010. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO X-NTH INCORPORATED, 2601 WESTHALL LANE, MAITLAND, FL 32751, UNDER GSA SCHEDULE GS23F0120P.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), posts this notice of intent to issue Modification 0001 against Contract Number WC1330-10-SE-0110 in order to add funding for additional supplemental professional engineering support services and extend the period of performance through 09/30/2010. <br /><br />In May 2009, NOAA awarded a delivery order, number WC1330-09-NC-1177, through competitive process, to X-NTH Incorporated against GSA Schedule GS23F120P. X-NTH Incorporated was tasked to develop an architectural and engineering Program of Requirements and cost estimate for the NESCC. X-NTH Incorporated delivered the Program of Requirements dated September 30, 2009. The current requirement for the development of the conceptual design and updating of the Program of Requirements is essentially follow-on work to that X-NTH Incorporated performed on delivery order WC1330-09-NC-1177. The information X-NTH Incorporated gathered from the research they conducted to produce the Program of Requirements is an essential component for expediting the development of the conceptual design package, updating the Program of Requirements and meeting the schedule for operation deployment in 2011. To consider sources other than X-NTH Incorporated would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the operation deployment schedule. A Contractor other than X-NTH Incorporated would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements to the point that they could begin work on developing the conceptual design and updating the Program of Requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from X-NTH Incorporated.<br /><br />This Concept Design is required to provide an entry level design for the purposes of procuring a Developer/Contractor to build out a facility to meet NOAA's High Performance Computing needs. The estimated value of this action is approximately $400,000.00. The scope of this delivery order falls into two phases, Concept Design and Supplemental Engineering Services. The description of task objectives will be conducted in two phases as follows:</p>
<p>Phase One: Concept Design</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop a Concept Design to include Concept Drawings, Concept Specifications, a Design Narrative, Concept Cost Estimate, and update the Program of Requirements dated 09/30/2009.</p>
<p>Phase Two: Supplemental Professional Engineering Services</p>
<p>In addition to providing Concept Design, NOAA requires the Contractor to provide Architect/Engineering (AE) and specialized technical services on an as needed basis over a period of six months. The Contractor shall provide professional engineering services to assist the Government in resolving any technical issues and in performing special design analysis.</p>
<p>This notice is for full disclosure compliance and announcement of potential subcontracting opportunities only. No competitive solicitation package is available, and no offers will be accepted from any source other than X-NTH Incorporated, 2601 Westhall Lane, Maitland, FL 32751, Telephone: (407) 660-0088.</p>
<p>Original Point of Contact:<br />Carey Marlow, Contract Specialist, Phone: (816) 426-7460, FAX: (816) 274-6923, Email: carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER.  Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will upgrade sanitary sewer facilities at Gees Bend Park, Ala., Ellis Landing Park, Ala, Holy Ground Battlefield Park, Ala., Swift Creek Park, Ala.,  and Six Mile Park, Alabama.  The contractor shall provide utility services to support construction of a modular restroom facility.  Utility services shall include water, wastewater (sanitary), electrical, and storm drainage support.  Incidental items requiring completing the work in accordance with the local, state, and federal codes and regulations shall also be required.   The work is within the scope of the original contracts  technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract.<BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.

Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f.

The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-866-618-5988, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 8, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>

<p><br />Category 6 UTP Drop Installation Statement of Work</p>
<p>Services: <br />Contractor will provide all labor and materials to install, test, and terminate the required amount of (according to the 4270 purchasing document) twisted 4 pair, UTP, 100 Ohm, 24 AWG, 500 MHz (minimum) category 6 communication drops to be used for data communication. All cables will be run in the existing cable trays except as specifically exempted in writing by the NMCP COTR before installation. Contractor will make use of the interstitial, existing conduits and adding to the current data jacks if possible. The cable backbone will be secured to the building structure every ten feet with proper fasteners if there are no existing cable trays or conduit. No cable run will be longer than 90 meters or 295 feet to allow placement of patch cables and still meet the maximum CAT6 limit of 95 meters or 327 feet. This includes an 18 inch concealed courtesy loop at the user end and 10 foot service loop at the closet end. Cables shall not bend beyond the radius specified by the manufacturer and should not bend beyond the Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard (TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Chap 10.2.1, and TIA/EIA B.1-1 Addendum 1). All cable, when penetrating a firewall, will be sleeved and sealed with fire stopping and will not exceed the 80% fill rate in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC). UTP cable jacketing will be stripped IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA 568B standards. In addition, the cabling will be run IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA standards to ensure cabling is not run over top of lighting or violating any other set standards. Drops will be installed as home runs from the user wall plate to the communication closet. All drops will be terminated at the user end with RJ-45 modular jacks (Panduit, Leviton or Ortronics when required). The outlets will be in flush or surface mounted boxes with single, dual, triple or quad face plates. Surface mounted boxes will only be used when flush mounted jacks are not feasible (this will need to be approved by Networking and Facilities at NMCP). Drops are to be installed only where existing electrical outlets exist within 6 feet, but not less than 3 feet, do not cross doorways, and will not cohabitate with electrical runs in modular furniture or conduits leading from the overhead. Data cables will be punched down on a government provided category 6 patch panel if present or a contractor provided patch panel (a modular Panduit or Leviton) if required in the 4270. All category 6 cables will be 100% tested to EIA/TIA standards upon completion of installation. Drops will be labeled in accordance with site labeling standards. All labeling will be machine produced; no handwritten labels are permitted to remain on the cabling. The standard used at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is communications closet name and drop number. For example 2A01-005, would be a properly labeled drop. All drops will have the room, outlet, and drop number on both ends of each cable. The same labeling will be found on the wall plate as well as the patch panel in the communication closet. When testing the cabling, the drops and the patch panel in the communications closet will be checked for correct labeling and accuracy. Once drops have been completed in any area with both installation and testing, contractor needs to contact the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389) to have the completed work inspected for accuracy and completion. At least 10% of the drop testing will be observed by a customer representative from the Network division. During move, relocation or construction projects all cabling that is disconnected SHOULD NOT be left in the ceiling. Vendor must completely remove the cable from the wall jack to the patch panel and carefully document the drop number that was removed. The removed cabling list will be provided to the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389). If cabling was removed through a firewall, all fire stopping must be replaced or filled-in in accordance National Electric Code (NEC).</p>
<p>Deliverables: <br />Contractor will provide site with complete test documentation as well as a cable running list (Appendix A). The cable running list will include building number, floor number, room number, drop number and drop location. Drop location is explained in Appendix B. If cable removal is applicable, vendor must provide a list of all data drop numbers removed to include room number it was removed from. (Appendix A). Contractor will also provide 2 CAT6 patch cables for each data drop installed. The cable at the patch panel will be 5ft in length and the other will be 15ft in length (the patch cables will be delivered to the Networking Office Bldg. 249 room 127).</p>
<p>**DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK, ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST ATTEND A "WALK THROUGH" TO EXAMINE WORK CONDITIONS AND EXISTING EQUIPMENT. BIDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FROM CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT ATTEND THE WALK THROUGH.**</p>

<CONTACT>ALISA FISHER, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 7033052250, Fax 703-305-2071, Email ALISA.FISHER@FNS.USDA.GOV
<DESC>Statement of Work<br />Healthier US School Challenge Reviewer
<p>I. Background Information an Objective</p>
<p>A. Background Information<br />Obesity is a growing health concern for children in the United States. The USDA believes that schools can take a leadership role in helping students learn to make healthier eating and active lifestyle choices. Many schools have already improved their school nutrition environments, found ways to increase opportunities for physical activity, and provided more nutritious and healthier choices for their students. FNS encourages schools to make these changes, and in 2004 established the Healthier US School Challenge (HUSSC) to recognize elementary schools creating healthier school environments through their promotion of good nutrition and physical activity. Because of the popularity of the initiative, the Challenge was expanded to include secondary schools in 2009. To qualify for the awards, a school must submit a formal application and meet basic criteria set forth by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Currently, four levels of superior performance are awarded: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Gold Award of Distinction.</p>
<p>With the launch of the Let's Move! Initiative in February 2010, criteria for the awards were further refined and included the goal of doubling the number of HUSSC schools by June 2011 and adding 1,000 more schools for each of the following two years. In addition, monetary incentives have been introduced to encourage schools to apply. Schools certified as Gold Award of Distinction will receive $2,000, Gold will receive $1,500, Silver $1,000 and Bronze $500. As a result of the new focus on HUSSC and the recent changes, FNS expects the workload involving the review of applications to increase substantially.</p>
<p>B. Objective<br />The objective of this purchase order will be to hire a consultant to review HUSSC applications and supporting documentation (eg, production records) against established criteria. The contractor should be able to complete three to six application reviews a week with each review taking approximately one to two hours. It is estimated that the contractor will review approximately 150-300 applications in one year.</p>
<p>II. Services to be Performed</p>
<p>A. General Requirements<br />The contractor will work off site and furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services to perform the work set forth below. FNS will cover mailing costs associated with the delivery and return of the print applications. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will monitor all work under the contract.</p>
<p>The contractor must participate in occasional telephone conference calls to discuss work related to the review of the HUSSC applications. FNS will provide as much advance notice of the conference calls as possible and make logistical arrangements for such calls (i.e., provide a call-in number).</p>
<p>The contractor must provide FNS with a list of completed HUSSC reviews and hours worked in an email message or an attached document with detailed comments to COR monthly.</p>
<p>The contractor should be available to work one day each week for one year. At the end of the one year period, FNS will determine if the services of the contractor are needed for an additional year.</p>
<p>The contractor must disclose any potential conflicts of interest, including other employment by or relationship to a State, school or school district, foodservice management company or food manufacturer.</p>
<p>B. Specific Requirements -Statement of Work<br />Specifically, the contractor will review applications and supporting content, document whether the application meets established criteria, and make a recommendation for final award determination to FNS.</p>
<p>Task 1 - Review of HUSSC Applications<br />Task Deliverable Timeline<br />1.1 Thoroughly review HUSSC Application for compliance with HUSSC criteria. Document findings on review worksheets (provided by FNS as a Microsoft Word 97 file), and provide final award determination recommendation to FNS. Submit completed review sheets and award recommendations electronically to FNS.</p>
<p>Within 10 business days of receipt of the application.</p>
<p>C. Performance Acceptance Standards<br />&bull; The review of each HUSSC application must be thorough and free of errors before submitting worksheets, findings and recommendations to FNS.<br />&bull; The review of each assigned HUSSC application must be completed within two weeks of receipt of application. Applications must be returned to FNS within seven business days following completion of the review. <br />The applications to be reviewed will be assigned by the COR.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria <br />In order to properly and efficiently review, and provide comments and an award determination recommendation, the contractor must possess: <br />1) Knowledge and extensive experience with Federal Nutrition Assistance Programs, particularly the National School Lunch Program.<br />2) Knowledge and extensive experience with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Healthier US School Challenge. <br />3) Extensive experience reviewing and evaluating HUSSC applications. <br />4) Experience with Microsoft Excel, Outlook, and Word.<br /><br />The period of performance is&nbsp;1 year.<br /><br />This&nbsp;procurement is being posted to solicit technical and price proposals in accordance with the above Statement of Work.&nbsp; All proposal should be submitted electronically by email to <a href="mailto:Alisa.Fisher@fns.usda.gov">Alisa.Fisher@fns.usda.gov</a> by the specified closing date for this proposal.</p>

<DESC>Description(s):  THIS IS AN AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) PROCUREMENT.
The resulting contract will utilize funds provided by the AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) of 2009; interested parties are notified that the inclusion of unique provisions required in implementing the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency, will be required of the successful bidder.

All future information about this acquisition will be distributed solely through this website. This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201; however, the Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation. 

The Forest Service is in need of pre-commercial tree thinning activities to reduce tree density and, by the deliberate selection of leave trees, improve the overall health and condition of a stand based on the prescribed objectives.  Tree selection and cutting of undesirable or excess trees will provide space for the leave trees to grow and develop, thereby reducing the incidence of insect and disease that affect growth, and undesirable tree qualities.   

The solicitation is for tree thinning activities on the Kootenai National Forest, Cabinet Ranger District.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished), and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the areas specified.  All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services will be performed over the entire unit.

The period of performance will be from award, approximately July 1, 2010  to September 30, 2011,  intermittently, as weather permits.

<p>PRESS INSPECTION: Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor's printing facility for quality conformance. Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16" in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers.

Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000&deg; kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray-booth and functional densitometers. If the presses are equipped with automatic scanners you are NOT relieved of the requirement for the customer colorbar as detailed above.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Leonardo Dagdug, Ph.D., Aldama No. 117 Casa 25, Mexico, Distrito Federal 16020, to acquire professional subject matter expertise in numerical simulation for a 24-month period to assist CIT's Division of Computational Bioscience (DCB) in the analysis of problems of molecular transport through membrane channels.
<p>DCB is currently collaborating with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH, in the analysis of problems of molecular transport through membrane channels. Specifically, NICHD and CIT are planning to develop a comprehensive theory of blocking of membrane channels by small molecular blockers and to use this theory to analyze detailed experimental data on blocking, such as the blocking of the Anthrax Channel by cyclodextrins. These data are reported in a paper recently accepted for publication. [Reference: Nestorovich, E. M. et. al. "Blockage of Anthrax PA63 Pore by a Multi-Charged High-Affinity Toxin Inhibitor." Biophysical Journal]. This ambitious 24-month program will involve computer simulations which will be used to model the blocking with the goal to clarify the picture of the process and to check the accuracy of accepted approximations.</p>
<p>In order to support the CIT-NICHD 24-month collaborative project, DCB requires contracted computational expertise in the simulation of complex processes like channel-facilitated membrane transport, endosomal sorting, etc. The contracted subject matter expert must possess an advanced degree in Statistical Physics and an established expertise in the field of numerical simulation of biomedical processes at the molecular level. In addition, the Contractor must possess all of the following:</p>
<p>1. A deep understanding of:</p>
<p>a. Physical kinetics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, including theory of transport in compartmentalized media that imitate intra-cellular space, and theory of diffusion-limited reactions;</p>
<p>b. Biophysics, including theories of membrane transport and the channel- facilitated transport; and</p>
<p>c. Theory of random walks and stochastic processes in application to transport problems in biophysics, like transport of macromolecular solutes through large membrane channels and transport of glucose by specialized transporters.</p>
<p>2. Expertise and demonstrable experience in multiple mathematical programming languages, including, Fortran, Mathematica, Matlab, Scilab, or similar.</p>
<p>3. Expertise and demonstrable experience with advanced operating systems including Linux, Unix, and languages including C++.</p>
<p>4. Expertise and demonstrable experience in carrying out scientific computations on large parallel clusters using Unix, LSF, BSF.</p>
<p>5. Expertise and demonstrable experience with numerical simulations of continuous and discrete systems, numerical solution of partial and ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />During previous post-doctoral work at DCB, Dr. Leonardo Dagdug acquired a unique combination of experience and expertise in numerical simulation by directly supporting the CIT-NICHD collaborative project, including the efforts leading to the preparation of the previously mentioned article scheduled to be published. During the past 10 years under his post-doctoral assignment, Dr. Dagdug collaborated with DCB scientific staff in researching problems including transport in conical channels, diffusion-controlled binding to a site located on the wall of a membrane channel, particle equilibration between two cavities connected by a channel, ligand equilibration between tubular and vesicular parts of the endosome in the endosomal sorting, diffusion in tubes with dead ends, and entropy barrier effect on diffusion.</p>
<p>As a result of his previous work, he has acquired a unique computational expertise in the simulation of complex processes like channel-facilitated membrane transport, endosomal sorting, etc. This expertise has been crucial to the CIT-NICHD collaborative project which is expected to result in the development of a comprehensive theory of channel blocking by small molecule blockers. Over the past 10 years, Dr. Dagdug, who holds a Ph.D. in Statistical Physics, has collaborated with NIH investigators and jointly published a number of papers on the subject matter with DCB scientific staff who have directly supported the CIT-NICHD collaborative project.</p>
<p>CIT has determined that Dr. Dagdug is the only commercially available source with the required combination of previous experience and computational skills who can successfully provide the necessary subject matter expertise to assist CIT-NICHD with the simulation of complex biophysical processes during the CIT-NICHD 24-month collaborative project.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their experience and expertise which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they can fulfill all of the requirements specified above.

Brand Name Justification:  Purchase of this Oracle technical support is necessary and fully justified due to the fact that this is a support renewal for currently owned Oracle Hyperion products.  Oracle is the only authorized provider of the support services; although resellers may coordinate purchases for Hyperion SQR for Oracle Maintenance.  Oracle does not allow any reseller to provide the support services for its Hyperion SQR for Oracle licensing.  A reseller may coordinate the purchase of support, but will never actually provide the support.

If exercised, CLIN 0010 shall be delivered no later than six months from date of option exercise. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>For CLIN 0001 through CLIN 0013, the provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items is incorporated. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>For CLIN 0001 and CLINs 0010 through 0013, the following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers. The following factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price:</p>
<p>1. Technical Understanding: The proposals will be evaluated on the Offeror's understanding of the task areas and technical requirements as described in the SOW and other attachments to the solicitation. The proposals will be evaluated on the depth and soundness of the Offeror's technical understanding of NRL's requirements. The proposals will also be evaluated on:<br />(i) whether the proposal indicates a clear understanding of both the radar absorbing material (RAM) performance and its layout within the CTS anechoic chamber in order to achieve the specified anechoic chamber performance; (ii) whether the proposal includes a new RAM layout or clearly states that the current layout will be used; (iii) whether the proposal includes data sheets from simulations/analyses that summarizes the expected performance of the refurbished CTS anechoic chamber; (iv) whether the proposal includes data sheets for the types of RAM to be used on the project that show that the absorption, fire retardancy and reflectivity specifications will be met; (v) whether the Offeror manufactures and installs RAM and does the offeror have experience in the design of anechoic chambers.<br />2. Management, Corporate Experience, and Schedule: The proposals will be evaluated on the Offeror's ability to schedule, manage and execute the work outlined in the SOW. The proposals will also be evaluated on: (i) whether the proposal provides information on the team that will be responsible for executing this project, including what parts each team member will perform; <br />(ii) whether the proposal provides information on how the team members will be managed to ensure the success of the overall effort; (iii) whether a project manager is proposed and what corporate resources are available to this project manager; (iv) whether the proposal provides a project schedule; (v) how much down-time is anticipated for the on-site tasks of absorber removal, surface preparation, absorber installation and performance testing.<br />3. Past Performance: The proposals will be evaluated on the Offeror's performance on recent similar projects. The proposals will also be evaluated on: (i) information provided by the Offeror on large initial RAM installation or RAM refurbishment projects that have been completed or are currently underway; (ii) the number of such projects performed in the past five (5) years; <br />(iii) whether the proposed products and workmanship conforms to customer technical requirements; (iv) the Offerors ability to adhere to project schedules; (v) letters of recommendation, references, or other documentation showing past performance.</p>
<p>For CLINs 0002 though 0009, the following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement, Past Performance, and Price. Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the option to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />A site visit is hereby scheduled on 02 June 2010 at 10:00 AM E.S.T, at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC. Site visit details and requirements are available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/10jr06.htm . All prospective offerors are urged to attend the site visit. Directions to the Naval Research Laboratory can be found at http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=DIRECTIONS<br />All questions shall be submitted no later than seven (7) days prior to RFP closing. Failure of a prospective offeror to attend the site visit or submit questions will be construed to mean that the offeror fully understands all requirements of the solicitation. No individual site visits will be scheduled.<br />Offeror shall complete the following electronic annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database: FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items.

<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO.3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FORCONGRESSIONAL EARMARK FOR VIRTUAL LEARNING MAGNET FOR SPACE SCIENCE AND MATH INDEPENDENTSTUDY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice servesas the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not beissued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions generated from modification-2 forclarification issues.QUESTION:1). If we would like to make any modifications to our proposal, in what format shouldthose modifications be provided?  Can we simply address any points of clarification ormissing information in a Microsoft Word document?  If we determine no clarifications needto be made to our proposal, do we still need to submit a statement to that effect?ANSWER:Please provide any additional information in your company's standard form. Clarifications may be documented in a Microsoft word document.	If MSFC does not receiveany additional information, it will be assumed that the vendor believes their offer isincompliance with all requirements.QUESTION:2). We assume, based on our interpretation of item #1 in the Request for Clarification toRFQ NNM10315186, that a contractor would be expected to use existing NASA contentcurrently housed on publicly available websites (www.nasa.gov).  We also interpret item#1 to mean that a contractor will assume all responsibility related to the development ofSTEM content for the proposed modules and that NASA personnel will not be available torecommend or provide STEM content for use in the modules.  Are these interpretationscorrect?ANSWER:Both of these interpretations are correct. QUESTION:3). Item 1 concludes  the quoter is expected to select and propose STEM content relatedto NASA for each proposed module.Our question centers around the meaning of the word is. In this case, is is beingused in the present tense, or the future tense?If in the present tense  Does this mean that proposals should contain a narrative that describes the proposedmodules and includes specific examples of STEM content related to NASA within therespective module?  In other words, does MSFC require a draft design document for each ofthe proposed modules in the proposal? If in the future tense Our proposal assumes that NASA MSFC would want to be involved in the global direction ofthe STEM content to be developed  if nothing more than to suggest that the audience ofteachers and students prefers learning that centers around spaceflight over other agencymissions.  Once given this general direction, we would then independently produce all ofthe content modules, requiring only periodic reviews and approvals by MSFC personnelduring routine content development milestones.	As a result, our proposal utilizesillustrative examples of existing NASA mission-oriented content and broad suggestionsabout types of STEM content and learning activities.  However, these illustrativeexamples are based on our own work with NASA and could, in fact, be converted intoNASA-oriented STEM content within the scope of work. Or are we mistaken in ourassumption, and in fact, the review committee wants to see a proposal containing adetailed and specific series of STEM content module outlines exactly as they would beproduced?ANSWER:NASA is looking for a brief summary of the proposed STEM content as it relates to NASAsubject matter for each proposed module.The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 5/28/2010.Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.

<DESC>This notice constitutes Amendment No. 02 to the Combined Synopsis/RFQ entitledNAVIGATOR GPS FRONT-END ELECTRONICS posted on May 06, 2010. Companies shall acknowledgeall amendment (s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subjectsynopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify and answer a technical question receivedregarding this acquisition. The response for the RFQ has not changed. Question and Answer are provided below: Question - Par. 3.6.3:	Shock test is always specified by SHOCK LEVEL, SHOCK DURATION andPULSE SHAPE.  I dont see this requirement at this time.  Is this something that shouldbe deferred at this time?Answer: The component shock response spectrum (SRS) is intended to characterize theexpected shock environment at the interface to the Front-End Electronics (FEE).  Thisinformation is provided to allow assessment of the hardware against this shockenvironment.  If the vendor can demonstrate that the hardware is not susceptible todamage from this shock environment, preferably by comparison with previous test exposure,then component shock testing is not required.If there is insufficient information to demonstrate that the FEE can survive the expectedshock environment, then the hardware may need to be shock tested to demonstratequalification.	If shock testing is required, then the appropriate shock test level willneed to be defined.  Typically, shock testing is performed using either a mechanicalimpact device or on a shaker table.  If a mechanical impact device is used, then it willbe necessary to tune the impact parameters to match the required SRS shown in Figure 3-2of the performance specification.  If shock simulation is being performed through the useof a shaker table, then a suitable transient waveform must be defined that matches therequired SRS.  Typically, a tuned single-pulse (i.e half-sine) is not sufficient togenerate the frequency content of a pyro-shock event and a more complex transientwaveform is required if shaker testing is being used to demonstrate shock qualification. However, the definition of an equivalent half-sine pulse can be useful to evaluate themagnitude of the shock environment in the time domain.For reference, an equivalent half-sine pulse has been derived that has a peak SRSmagnitude and frequency content that provides an approximate match to the shock SRSenvironment specified in Figure 3-2 of the FEE performance specification.  The details ofthis half-sine pulse are as follows:Shock Amplitude:  400gPulse Type:  half-sinePulse Duration:  0.04 msec (4 x 10-4 secs)The half-sine pulse defined above is shown in Figure 1.  Also shown in this figure is acomplex transient waveform that has been derived using a series of decaying sine waves. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the SRS for each of the simulated shock transients ascompared with the expected shock environment.  It can be seen from Figure 2 that thecomplex transient shows a better match with the expected shock environment over a widerfrequency range.The specification of the transient waveform for shock testing the FEE is not required atthis time.  The near-term requirement is for the vendor to provide an assessment of thehardware against the shock environment as defined in the performance specification and todetermine if shock testing should be performed.  If based on this assessment, shocktesting is required then the appropriate test configuration and input parameters can bedefined at that time.The due date for RFQ responses is midnight EDT, TUESDAY, MAY 25, 2010. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of thesolicitation and amendments (if any).

Any discounts offered (e.g. quantity discounts) will be applied at one-half the amount proposed for the purpose of calculating lowest-price, if multiple discounts are offered that mean will be used for those calculations. With respect to sizes, quantities will be distributed as follows: 20% S, 25% M, 30% L, and 25% XL.</strong></p>

<DESC>Collaborative Website Requirement
VA798-10-RQ-0106

A.	Remove the last sentence under Instructions for Preparation of Quotes, Price Quotation, which currently reads as follows:

Offerors must also include in this part copies of their GSA contracts that include the services offered and GSA pricing.

B.	Remove the following paragraph found under Preparation of Quotes, Factor 5:

   (a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

C.	Questions and Answers

1.	We are considering a subcontractor, and wondered if they must be constrained to 49% of the work, or less?

Government Response:  This is an unrestricted RFQ which contains no set-aside for any socio-economic group.  Therefore, subcontracting is unrestricted pending approval of the Contracting Officer.

2.	We offer our software on the GSA Schedule. Should that be the price we quote for our software? [Our services are not on schedule.]

Government Response:  This requirement is being solicited open market and therefore, references to GSA Schedules have been removed (see A., above).

3.	How many SES members would we be working with?

Government Response:  Approximately 400

4.	How many SESers are likely to use the website?

Government Response:  Our goal is that all 400 will eventually use the site.   

5.	Does VA want to host the website or should the contractor host it?

Government Response: The design is for VA to host the website with content provided by the contractor.
 
6.	For how many option years should the contractor expect the website to be active beyond the first year?   Should pricing for the option years be provided as well?

Government Response:   Pricing for options years was not requested although it is likely that contractor involvement in the website would be needed.  

7.	Upon the completion of Stage II, does the VA want to operate the website itself, or have the contractor operate it?

Government Response:  VA wishes to operate the website.  

8.	Does the VA want to manage the care and feeding of the website (i.e., loading participants, loading content, etc.) or should the contractor perform these functions?  If the contractor is to perform the functions, please indicate some levels of effort likely to be required of the contractor, such as loading xxx documents, etc.

Government Response:  We envision that the contractor would perform this function, at least initially.  The level of effort will be proportionate to the content design that is provided by the selected contractor.   

9.	If the contractor is to host the website, please characterize the types, sizes and quantities of VA best practices and other documents the VA is likely to want loaded onto the website.

Government Response:  This is not defined at this time and will be largely determined by the results of the assessment.

10.	Does this solicitation require that all personnel working on the project be physically located at that location?  Since this work is for the assessment, establishment, piloting, and maintenance of a collaborative capability, will the government consider a solution that incorporates the use of remote workers, particularly during the later phases of the program where the capability is being maintained?  There is significant precedence for large scale Communities of Practice within in the Department of the Army to be remotely facilitated and managed.

Government Response:  Physical location would seem relevant during the initial stage so the project although this is not an absolute requirement.  

11.	Is there any deliberation on this site being accessible to the general public or at least other government agencies in the future (impacts technology selection)?

Government Response:  Not at this time. 

12.	Do you have an estimated number of community participants including SES, political, and GS 15 positions?

Government Response:   The Government will attempt to provide this information prior to due date of proposals.

13.	How many approval layers are there in this project, i.e., program manager, division, and Secretary-level?

Government Response:  Generally two levels (occasionally three): Program Manager, Deputy Assistant Secretary (and Assistant Secretary)  

14.	How many VA project team members are there and what are their ranks?

Government Response:  GS 15 and SES 

15.	Does this project have the Secretary's buy-in or does it have buy-in from the VA SES (impacts strategy phases and, to a lesser degree, technology buy-in)?  This is an important question which can save VA time and money because our strategy can be constructed in such a way as to begin to develop consensus and buy-in from the start versus one in which the project is presented as a fait accompli and we're there just to gather information. 

Government Response:  The objective is to secure meaningful input and buy-in from the primary users.    

16.	Who is the VA program manager tasked with implementing this initiative?  If you are not able to provide a name please provide the person's level?

Government Response:  GS 15 

17.	Did the Assistant Secretary or the Human Resources and Administration staff work with an outside vendor to prepare this RFP or create this community web site initiative?  If so, with whom?

Government Response:  The concept for this initiative is based on research conducted into other examples of Collaborative initiatives.

18.	Since this is a new requirement there is no incumbent, however, will this be acquired under any other existing IDIQ or other contracts in addition to the open competition?

Government Response:  No.  This is the only procurement action being pursued for this requirement.

19.	Has a budget been authorized and allocated for the community web site initiative for FY 2010 and FY2011?  If so, what is the budget?

Government Response:  A budget has been authorized and allocated for this initiative.  The amount of that budget is Government proprietary information.

20.	How did VA develop the project timeline?

Government Response:  It is an estimated timeline. 

21.	What are the current cross-agency communication vehicles in place, (i.e., email, listserv, intranet, newsletter) and which VA office is responsible for these communication vehicles?

Government Response:  This is information we hope to gather through the assessment process. 

22.	Under the deliverables section it states that the contractor will be responsible for text edits including grammar and formatting.  Will we be responsible for writing any content?  Could you please clarify who will write the content for the collaborative web site pages that are not SES user generated pages?  For example, there may be an "about" page or a "terms of use" page to help SES members utilize the site properly.  Who will write these?  

Government Response:  The contractor should assume they will be responsible for developing ALL content for the site in conformance with VA standards. 

23.	Many communities have a dedicated resource that monitors user comments, uploaded documents, etc.  Even in a professional environment the community manager may be looking for inappropriate posts or attacks on another user.  I doubt this will be the case with the VA SES site but when there is no policeman sometimes even minor slights can get out of control.  Inappropriate posts aside, there may be a need for a community monitor to make sure that classified  documents are not accidentally posted or that other sensitive information is prematurely posted.  All communities have ground rules and my experience has taught me that professional communities have a few more ground rules than a public social networking site.  Who will monitor the community to make sure the rules are followed?  We understand, if chosen, we'll be assisting VA in monitoring metrics but will the contractor be responsible for anything beyond metrics and functionality fine-tuning? 

Government Response:  Monitoring the community for inappropriate posts is not a component of this work.  

24.	We utilize various project management software tools internally, including SharePoint.  When the RFP states create an online project dialogue does VA envision using one of our internal tools or would we need to provide a specific solution?  If a specific project communication solution, please define.  This question is referring to VA project team and New Target project team communication, schedule management, and the like and not the actual software used to build the collaborative site.  Is there a requirement for us to use a certain project management, document sharing, or scheduling software during the project?  We typically use Microsoft Project, SharePoint or a similar program called AutoTask (which we use is based on complexity and project size) to communicate and share documents with our clients.  Does the VA have a project management software requirement?

Government Response:  There is no requirement at this time for the contractor to use a specific project management software. 

25.	Are there any data integration components to authenticate members of the online community?  Does VA have a database of active employees parsed by their rank? 

Government Response:  Yes

26.	Will online community members be able to access the community from outside the VA while travelling or at home?  Or is it contemplated to be an "onsite" internal community?

Government Response:  Yes to the first question; No to the second.

27.	Will the site require video or audio content beyond basic uploading and downloading?  In other words, will the video or audio play within QuickTime or Windows Media Player or would you like it to play within a browser?

Government Response:  This has not been determined. 

28.	Will there be different levels of community access based on rank, e.g., GS 15 will have read only access while an SES member can read and post information?

Government Response:  To be determined.

29.	The solicitation does not specify a particular contract vehicle, does this imply that we can use any appropriate one or does the VA have a preference?

Government Response:  This will be a firm fixed price contract.

30.	The solicitation does not specify the type of contract (FFP, T&M, etc) for the CLINs. It would appear to be FFP, can you please verify this?

Government Response:  This will be a firm fixed price contract.

31.	Is there an incumbent that is currently performing work related to the requirements in the RFQ? If so, can you provide the name?

Government Response:  There is no incumbent.

32.	If there is not an incumbent, has a particular firm already worked with VA to develop the requirements for this RFP and/or project estimates? If so, can you provide us the name of the firm?

Government Response:  No, there is no other firm that has already worked with VA to develop the requirement.

33.	Under Factor 1 - Past Performance, the RFQ states that the Offeror must identify no more than 2 contracts. In the same paragraph it also states that if a teaming arrangement is formed, each party should submit a minimum of 2 contracts for past performance but not more than 5. These would appear to conflict. Can we submit 2 past performance contracts for each party in a teaming arrangement and meet the requirements? 

Government Response:  Yes

34.	Under factor 4 - Socio-Economic status, the RFQ states that SDVO Offerors receives full credit, VO offerors receive partial credit and Offerors with SDVO or VO's as subcontractor will receive some consideration. Can you please clarify the distinction between partial credit and some consideration? Does the proposed share of work between an Offeror and their SDVO or VO subcontractor affect the credit afforded for this factor?

Government Response:  Partial credit would equate to half the credit given for full credit.  Some consideration would equate to about one fourth of full credit, dependent upon the extent to which the SDVOSB or VOSB will be supporting the effort.  

35.	Has the VA already identified a collaborative software tool that the vendor should use? Or a set of tools it owns that we should select from in preparing a response?

Government Response:  No

36.	Will the government please confirm rates can be taken from multiple schedules if the Contractor is utilizing subcontractors for the RFQ?  

Government Response:  This requirement is being solicited open market and therefore, references to GSA Schedules have been removed (see A., above).

37.	Will the government please clarify what is meant by the following statement contained in the SOW: "As such, the contractor shall assist the VA in conducting an assessment of political and career Senior Executives from the VA to take ownership, facilitated by the contractor that will form the basis of a clear plan for how to create an online community with the functionality it needs."     

Government Response: The contractor will be expected to assess the existing communications practices and need/interests of the target populations utilizing methods geared to generate ownership by the executives over the design of the final product.
 
38.	Will the government please clarify what kind of content is going to be available for the Pilot outlined in the Statement of Work?   

Government Response:  That will be defined by the assessment; a general description of content is provided in the purpose and scope sections of the RFP

Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. The statute requires that privatization must reduce the Air Force's life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services. All privatization projects will be supported by an economic analysis based on accepted life-cycle costing procedures that demonstrate the long-term economic benefit and reduced long-term costs. If the economic analysis determines that privatization is uneconomical, a contract will not be awarded, and proposal costs will not be paid. The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems. North American Industry Classification Codes of 221122 (Electric Power Distribution), 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution), 221310 (Water Supply Systems) and 221321 (Sewer Treatment Facilities) apply. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its supplements apply to this procurement. <br />
<p>The Contractor(s) will be required to manage, control and perform its operations, maintenance, repairs, replacements and incidentals of its utility system(s) to provide firm, reliable and dependable utility service to each Government or tenant connection within the service area 24 hours each and every day. The utility systems will be conveyed by way of a Bill of Sale upon award of contract(s) and real property interests will be granted in the form of a Right-of-Way. The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award. The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment Utility Services Contract(s) for a term of 50 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist. This requirement is unrestricted. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered. To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). You may register via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov . Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan that meets the requirements of FAR 52.219-9. The request for proposal will be available by downloading from the FedBizOps Internet site-no paper copies or CD's will be provided. Interested parties are required to self-register their firm or office on the website. It is the proposer's responsibility to check the website for amendments and other information related to the request for proposal. Proposals shall be submitted by mail or hand carried in accordance with the time, date and location specified in Block 9 of the SF33.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION EXTENDS THE SUSPENSE DATE FOR THE SOC SUBMISSION TO FRIDAY, 11 JANUARY 2008
The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.  

The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Friday, 11 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.

Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also is available upon request from the contracting officer, Capt Peterson. If your company previously submitted a SOC in response to the original posting and the SOC is adequate, no further submission is required. However, please communicate with the contact listed below to express continued interest in this potential acquisition.</p>
<p>The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length. This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission. Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format. All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other than the incumbent exists. Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Capt Andrew Peterson, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement for the management and operation of a correctional facility to house a population of approximately 3,000 low security adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens with one year or less remaining to serve on their sentence. This population is currently housed in various IGAs and MOUs throughout the Southwestern United States, concentrated primarily in Texas. The funding for this project will come from current budgeted funds expended for housing and medical care of these STS inmates in the existing IGAs and MOUs. This requirement may be fulfilled through a single award or multiple awards resulting from this solicitation. The solicitation may result in an award or awards up to approximately 3,000 beds. The BOP anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house a minimum of 900 beds to a maximum of 3,000 beds. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution or institutions located in the Southwestern United States. The facility(ies) must be located in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, or Arizona.
<p>Proposed institutions shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. Effective at the date of NTP, offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Shared services within each fence line is not acceptable.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 120 days after contract award at the rate specified in the resulting contract. An existing facility is defined as an institution ready to accept inmates, or for which construction expansion began, prior to the date of this notice. Expansion of a facility or new construction of a facility initiated after the date of this notice is prohibited.</p>
<p>Potential offerors must submit all potential places of performance to be proposed to the Contracting Officer by 06/11/2010. In addition, offerors must submit a digital aerial photo of the proposed facility with their completed Intent to Propose response.</p>
<p>The BOP intends to award a firm-fixed price, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award(s) will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and six one-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a Performance Work Statement based on the American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. Price is significantly more important than non-price factors. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action. The BOP anticipates that NEPA will be satisfied through the preparation of an Environmental Assessment prior to contract award.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith Based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p>The solicitation&nbsp;posting date is&nbsp;05/21/2010, with&nbsp;the closing date for receipt of proposals on 07/20/2010. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for CCR is www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System code for this solicitation is 561210, Facilities Support Services.

<SOLNBR>AG-9702-S-10-0261
<CONTACT>Charles Wallach, Phone 7075629174, Email cwallachiv@fs.fed.us
<DESC>RECOVERY: The USDA Forest Service, Los Padres National Forest (hereafter "the Government," "the Forest Service," or "the Los Padres National Forest (NF)"), announces a design-build opportunity using funds from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This acquisition is being advertised as FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION and any resultant contract award will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 19, Subpart 19.10, Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. In accordance with FAR Part 36.204(h), the estimated magnitude of construction is more than $10,000,000. Contract period of performance time is 24 months after the notice to proceed. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220. The Small Business Administration size standard is $33.5 million. Contractors are required to be actively registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis, the pending solicitation or any follow up information requests. The solicitation with supporting documents (if any) will be posted to the FedBizOpps website on or about 26 May, 2010. No hard copies of the solicitation, supporting documents and applicable amendments, if any will be provided. To receive the entire solicitation package and any applicable amendments, prospective offerors must download them from the FedBizOpps website. This acquisition is a Design-Build project and is prepared in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR Part 36 and as authorized by Section 4105 of the Clinger-Cohen Act and will be supplemented with additional information included in the solicitation. The contractor shall provide all management and project administration services, quality control, logistical support, vehicles, equipment and materials to complete the project on time and on schedule.&nbsp;The project consists of the complete design and construction of two District Ranger Stations to replace several existing buildings at the Los Padres NF, including options. The project includes access and interior roads and parking, and associated site work and utilities. It may also require improvement or modification of existing building(s) to meet the site requirements. It requires further design development and preparation of a complete set of construction drawings and specifications based upon design considerations and performance specifications included within this contract, and the subsequent construction of this design to result in a complete and finished product suitable for the intended use. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price Design-Build contract based on the approved design documents for the new District Ranger's Office buildings. The Government will issue two (2) Solicitations in sequence: (1) Phase I and (2) Phase II. The Phase I procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Proposal (RFP) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified offerors who will be requested to submit Phase II proposals (the short list will be published on FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase I proposal. A minimum of two (2) and a maximum of four (4) firms will be short-listed. The short-listed offerors will be selected to participate in Phase II (analogous to RFP). In Phase II, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified offerors from Phase I and request that they submit Phase II proposals. Phase II of the solicitation will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase II evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase II of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase II offers without discussions. A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of Phase II offers and selection of the successful offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. The Forest Service will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.

This procurement is restricted to eligible 8(a) firms with a bona fide place of business within the respective jurisdictions of the SBA district offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  A bona fide branch office is a place of business, for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary. The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites. In addition, all 8(a) firms must be currently registered and in good standing as a certified 8(a) program participant at the time proposals are due and verified at the time of contract award.  Eligibility will be determined by SBA as of the time of submission of Phase Two offers which include price.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the annual size standard is $14 million.
The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $100,000,000. Task orders will range between $50,000 and $5,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.
This procurement consists of two solicitations, issued in sequence, with the intent to award three or more Firm Fixed Price (FFP) IDIQ MACCs, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.3 Two Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, to (a) successful, responsive, responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) conform(s) to the solicitation and (is) are considered the best value to the Government, considering price and other factors combined.  
The work to be acquired under this MACC is for new construction and repair by (primarily) design-build or (secondarily) fully designed projects of Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems construction, repairs, maintenance and associated work at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility, including but not limited to: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  
Phase One solicitation is a RFQ in accordance with FAR Part 36.3. Phase One will be in accordance with FAR 36.303-1 and will consist of technical approach, technical qualifications, and bonding submissions to be evaluated to determine qualifications.  The maximum number of Prospective Offeror(s) (PO(s)) that will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal is six (6), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than six (6) is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting. Phase One qualifications will be based on evaluation of the following: factors: Factor A - Technical Approach; Factor B - Technical Qualifications; Factor C - Bonding Capacity.  After evaluation of Phase One proposals, the contracting officer shall select the most highly qualified Offerors and request that only those Offerors selected submit Phase Two proposals. Unsuccessful Phase One POs will receive notice of their non-selection at the same time.  Results will not be published in Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS).  Phase One submissions and evaluations will not be carried over into Phase Two.  POs ARE ADVISED SELECTION FOR ADVANCEMENT INTO PHASE TWO MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED.  Phase Two solicitation N62473-10-R-5404 is a RFP in accordance with FAR Part 15 and includes Phase Two evaluation factors developed in accordance with 15.304 and 36.303-2. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the POs selected in Phase One, which will be evaluated separately.  Phase Two proposals will be accepted only from those POs who have been specifically invited to submit a Phase Two proposal and who receive the Phase Two solicitation from the Contracting Officer.  Phase Two RFP will be based on evaluation of the following factors:  Phase Two:  Factor 1 - Past Performance; Factor 2 - Engineering Solution; Factor 3 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  Phase One qualifications and evaluations will not be considered in the Phase Two evaluations and determination of Best Value. The best value tradeoff source selection process as described in FAR Part 15 will be used for Phase Two to ensure selection of contractors evidencing the best overall capability to perform the anticipated work in a manner most advantageous to the government in accordance with established evaluation criteria.  
The Government intends to evaluate and award contract(s) without discussions.  
THE PHASE ONE RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  The RFQ will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://fbo.gov/ on or about May 26, 2010.

<SUBJECT>C--Design-Build RFP for the Invitro Fertilization Department
<SOLNBR>N4008010D4418
<CONTACT>Dana Colletti (301) 295-0531
<DESC>"THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY."  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO HSMM/HOK AS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.
TITLE: DESIGN BUILD RFP FOR THE INVITRO FERTILIZATION DEPARTMENT AT THE NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MARYLAND
This proposed contract action based on other than full and open competition will be a firm-fixed price, sole source award to HSMM/HOK for Design Build for the Invitro Fertilization Department at the National Naval Medical Center. It is requested that other than full and open competition be permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, with only one responsible source. 
HSMM/HOK has been heavily involved with the Invitro Fertilization Department from the onset of the BRAC project and developed the original design build RFP which included the requirements for the Invitro Fertilization department in Building 9. A new A/E would have to invest significant effort to become familiar with the requirements as they have been developed up to this point, would have to reestablish a working rapport with the end users, and expend considerable time with the end users to confirm their understanding of the requirements.
Also, HSMM/HOK has already conducted site investigations of Building 8 to see if the top floor is an adequate alternate location when the department was displaced from Building 9.  A new A/E would have to expend considerable effort becoming familiar with the NNMC campus and reassessing all the spaces HSMM/HOK is already familiar with.
Additionally, HSMM/HOK recently developed a very similar initial design and RFP for the Bethesda Main Operating Rooms (MOR) renovations project.  Many aspects of the Main Operating Rooms RFP could be applied to the Invitro RFP including an independent HVAC system, a new penthouse, complex medical gas utilities and prep and recovery areas.  However, a new A/E would have to largely develop the RFP and the specialized designs from scratch, resulting in a significant duplication of effort.
The estimated release of the RFP is the 5th of June 2010.  The time frame for receipt of proposals will be provided in the solicitation notice.

FISC Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, on an other than full and open competitive basis from Valour LLC, Aircraft Maintenance services for the Marine Helicopter Squadron's seven (7) CH-46E and six (6) CH-53 E type/model/series (T/M/S) aircraft.  Maintenance of the aircraft shall be conducted primarily at the HMX-1 hangar space and flight line aboard the Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF), Marine Corps Base (MCB) Quantico, VA.  The contractor will be provided the necessary tools, parts, support equipment/Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL), personal protective equipment (PPE) not limited to cranial with sound suppressers installed, safety goggles/face shields, gloves, apron, chemical resistant coveralls, respirators and materials for aircraft maintenance as needed.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(5), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Valour LLC on a sole source basis under the HUBZone Act of 1997.

This will be an indefinite quantity term construction contract for projects ranging from approximately $500 to $100,000. The Government intends on selecting a minimum of two (2) contractors and a maximum of four (4) contractors for said contract. The exact number of awardees will be determined by the Source Selection Team during the evaluation of proposals and will be based primarily on the number, location, and capabilities of the highest rated firms as well as GSA's anticipated workload over the term of the contract.<br /><br />This solicitation is being issued as a small business set-aside. It is the Government's intent to make an award of this solicitation to an 8(a) Firm, a Disabled Veteran Owned Firm and a Very Small Business. If, after receipt and evaluation of proposals, GSA determines that an award to a Woman Owned, a Disabled Veteran Owned, or a Very Small Business cannot be made based on not meeting the requirements outlined in this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to make an award based on the submissions received and within the established competitive range. If, after receipt and evaluation of all proposals, GSA determines that between 2 and 4 awards cannot be made to small business firms that meet all of the requirements outlined in this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reissue this requirement under full and open competition. The estimated annual dollar value of all of the projects that will be issued under the multiple term contracts can be found by applying the contractor's offer percentage to the government estimate total. The maximum limitation per year shall be 150% of the awarded offer price. Individual delivery orders may be competed among the selected firms under the contract unless the Government deems otherwise for a specific delivery order. The proposed performance period is a total of 5 years, consisting of 1 base year, with the possibility of four (1) year option periods. This requirement is being set aside for small business concerns under NAICS Code 236220 and the Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 million.&nbsp;Copy of the request for proposal solicitation is available only through FedBizOpps.gov. Telephone requests will not be accepted.&nbsp;Proposals will be due approximately June 21, 2010, Monday, June 21, 2010,&nbsp;4:30 pm Eastern Time.&nbsp;There will be no public opening of offers. This announcement constitutes synopsis of the pre-solicitation notice and represents the Government's official information on this project.

Prior to issuance of any plans and specifications, contractors must comply with the Document Security Notice by completing it and returning it to GSA Region 3, Richmond Field Office (3PSSR), Robinson &amp; Merhige Federal Courthouse, 701 East Broad Street, Suite 4600, Richmond, VA 23219-1887.<br /><br />Original Point of Contact<br /><br />Linda Savage-Linder, Contracting Officer, Phone 804-771-2446, Fax 215-209-0509, Email linda.savage-linder@gsa.gov - Rosemary Epperson, Procurement Technician, Phone 804-771-2467, Fax 215 446-6129, Email <a href="mailto:rosemary.epperson@gsa.gov">rosemary.epperson@gsa.gov</a>.</p>

Sources Sought and Pre Qualification Notice - Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter (APBS) Installation

Description

The USPS is considering potential sources to upgrade many of the existing fleet of Small Parcel Bundle Sorter (SPBS) machines.  This upgrade will be performed by providing each location with a kit of SPBS upgrade parts which will be installed at each site.  The upgraded SPBS will be called the Automated Parcel Bundle Sorter (APBS).  The APBS parts will be integrated into the APBS "Build Kit.  This FedbizOpps announcement is for the installation of theses upgrade APBS Build Kits.  It is anticipated that each APBS Build Kit will be customized per USPS needs and will be packaged and shipped within the United States.

Background

The USPS is increasing productivity of its package processing operations by deploying automated package and bundle sortation equipment.  Existing SPBS machines will be upgraded with the APBS Build Kit.  Current USPS estimate of the number of APBS Build kits is between 100 and 200 APBS Build Kits to a projected 100 to 200 USPS sites.

The objective of this notice is to gather information from current sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  The USPS may use information gathered through this announcement to pre-qualify multiple sources for the opportunity to submit a proposals for possible future solicitations.

The APBS Build Kits will be shipped freight on board (FOB) destination to designated USPS sites by the APBS Build Kit supplier.  It is anticipated that 10 kits will be delivered to USPS sites every two weeks for installation.

This FebizOps announcement is for the APBS Build Kit installation services.  The APBS Build Kit supplier shall build and integrate per the USPS provide technical data package and the Installation supplier shall retrieve the Build Kit from site and perform the retrofit on the SPBS machines using the USPS Installation Guide.  The USPS will consider changes to the Installation Guide if it is determined to provide a more cost-effective and less-disruptive onsite installation



Pre-qualification Process

Pre-qualification is a process whereby a suppliers ability to meet specific USPS requirements is evaluated.  A purchase team will review and evaluate documentation submitted by interested suppliers in accordance with the evaluation factors listed in this announcement.  To receive credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all the requirements and submit adequate documentation.  Failure to address an item or submit the required documentation will reflect negatively in the evaluation scoring.

After the purchase team review and analyze supplier responses based on information requested in this pre-qualification process, suppliers may be placed on the pre-qualified list.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team decides (1) a smaller group will provide adequate competition, or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for the less qualified.
During this process, each prospective supplier can be assured of the following:
1.	All suppliers will be treated fairly and objectively
2.	The inclusion or exclusion of a particular supplier will be based on business decisions alone and will be judged solely on the predetermined pre-qualification criteria.
3.	A sufficient number of suppliers will be placed on the list to ensure adequate completion for subsequent requirements.
4.	Any sensitive business information provided by a supplier will be sufficiently protected from disclosure.

The pre-qualification process does not constitute an assurance that a subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  However, when, or if a RFP is issued, it will be provided to those suppliers on the pre-qualification list.  Should an RFP be issued, it may or may not result in an award, and the Postal Service reserves the right to make more than one award to procure the services required.  The USPS may elect to use the information received in the responses to this pre-qualification process to satisfy subsequent business needs. 

Late Submissions

Any document received at the office designated in the pre-qualification package after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before the evaluation takes place, and:
a.	It is the only submission received; or
b.	Consideration of the submission is determined by the contracting officer to be in the Postal Services interest.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONPURPOSES ONLY.NASA Glenn Research Center procured engineering services to develop control systems forthe Engine Icing Capabilities Enhancements at the Propulsion Systems Laboratory, Building125. This development work encompasses the engineering of control logic, computerprogramming and documentation related to process systems that are being installed at thefacility. The development of these control systems is necessary for the safe and reliableoperation of the process systems. Development of these control systems contributes to thedevelopment of a system capable of simulating altitude icing conditions experienced byaircraft during flight. By providing this icing simulation capability, NASA and itsengine industry partners will be able to further the understanding of effects of icingconditions on engine performance and safety. This understanding is critical to thedevelopment of safer and more reliable aircraft engine systems.THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. A cost-type (AF/AT) work order is appropriate for this procurement because the uncertainnature of the research/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to thelevel of accuracy necessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.NNC10QA19DNAICS CODE:  561210ESTIMATED DOLLAR AMOUNT (Contactor Estimate): $74,925.00

The format example contains pre-inserted (required) project information, estates to be appraised, etc.   The appraiser shall address the other required appraisal elements in the gross appraisal format to complete the report.<BR><BR>Due to size of project / number of parcels, a cursory estimation of value for the identified parcels/real estate interests is required.  Although the appraiser is required to utilize all sources of available market data to support value conclusions (comparable sales, MLS data, assessment data, SEV data, other professional sources, etc.), a separate appraisal for each parcel is not required.  Although the gross appraisal methodology may reflect aspects of a market study or project/multiple parcel appraisal report, the appraiser is expected to apply the appropriate unit of measurement (land value, improvement value, easement value, damages, etc.) and assign a separate value estimation to each parcel. <BR><BR>An exterior site inspection and photograph of all parcels is required. The appraiser is not required to make owner contact or complete an interior inspection of the improvements.  <BR><BR>There are numerous vacant and/or improved residential, commercial, and industrial properties that will require either a total acquisition or a partial acquisition of a levee or flowage easement.  <BR><BR>It is the appraisers responsibility to estimate the value of the required Fee and Easement estates and, if applicable, identify, estimate, and apply all measures of damages (severance, proximity, parking loss, etc.) to the remainders resulting from the proposed easements.<BR><BR>Approximately 125 properties are located along Ecorse Creek roughly between Dix Road and M-39 (Melvindale & Allen Park portion).  Approximately 69 properties are located between Inkster Road and Ecorse Road near Detroit Metro Airport (Westland & Romulus portion).

<DESC>RECOVERY THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-03-C-0017, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Walter F George Lake, ACF Rivers Project, Fort Gaines Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds were previously added to the basic contract. The contractor will develop specifications and perform building rehab services including connecting existing sewage system to FT Gaines, GA municipal system and installing a rainwater collection system for irrigation and erosion control at the ACF Rivers Project Management office. The modification will also incorporate contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds.<BR>This existing contract must be used because: 1) The contractor is currently performing a major renovation to the building these systems serve.  2) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on the visiting public, commercial shipping and the economy.   The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.

<DESC>This notice is for a construction services contract to fit-out the floor space at our newly consolidated office at the Diamond Plaza building in Ho Chi Minh City.
<p>The Statement of Work requires that the contractor upgrade the entire office space to match the existing specifications of the newly leased space, which was previously rented and fitted out by a large multinational corporation. The Contractor chosen for this job performed the fit out for that corporation approximately three years ago. The Contractor understands and has access to the supplies and detailed architectural and prior M&amp;E drawings that we require to have a unified, homogenous fit out which will include colors, paint, lighting, doors, office furniture, cubicles, even fabric that is to be used. <br /><br />The standardization of the entire floor is critical to the success of this fit out, The Contractor's knowledge and experience is unique in this situation because they are the one contractor that designed and constructed the portion of the floor that is the basis for the standardization.</p>
<p>The Authority cited in this Sole Source Justification is FAR 6.302-1. The Contracting Officer agrees with the Facility Manager that there is only one responsible source for the services required in this contract, that will satisfy the Government's requirements. This is primarily because the SOW requires standardization of highly specialized equipment and design specifications that the contractor already possesses due to their previous contract. In this case, the current work is considered to be continued development or a follow-on contract to expand the previous fit-out to the entire floor of the building.</p>

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the shipment and rigging of security equipment to and from US Airports. Accordingly, the TSA intends to award an extension to contract HSTS04-05-C-DEP156 until November 2010 to Siemens Government Services, 1010 E. Arapaho Road, Richardson Texas 75081. The contract extension will address the requirements of the Office of Security Technology's shipping and rigging requirements that are not currently on contract under the System Integrator IDIQ contract awarded task orders. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However all proposals received thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contract the above named company directly. <br />
