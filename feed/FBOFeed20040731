<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), Washington , DC.

Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to foster information exchange, dialogue, and collaboration between the State mental health and substance abuse treatment systems, and problem identification and resolution regarding State infrastructure development and systems improvement planning; and the implementation of consistent approaches to screening and assessment of co-occurring disorders, the development of information data systems, and the use of Performance Measures for co-occurring disorders.  Particular attention will be focused on individuals with co-occurring disorders who are homeless. Under a previous award, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD) collaborated with the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) to develop a White Paper on coordinating service for persons with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse problems on behalf of State Mental Health Authorities (SMHAs) and Single State Authorities (SSAs).  Additionally, the NASMHPD membership developed a Blueprint for Change that attached a set of action items to the White Paper that were believed to be the best methods for accomplishing the promise of improved services for this especially needy population.
NASADAD is the only organization supported by and representing the Single State Authorities for substance abuse services in the states and territories.  It is the only organization that complements the activities of the NASMHPD, which in turn is the only organization supported by and representing the Program Directors for Mental Health services in the states and territories.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1

<DESC>NA This sources sought/market research is to locate sources for acquisition of Spares and Depot Level Contractor Logistic Support for the Ground Data Terminal (GDT).  The GDT is part of the Joint STARS Surveillance and Control Data Link (SCDL).  The GDT is us ed with the Joint STARS Common Ground Station (CGS) or equivalent.  An Air Data Terminal (ADT) and one or more GDT are required to establish a two-way communications net between the Joint STARS aircraft and one or more Joint STARS ground stations.  The ADT  omni-directionally broadcasts KU-band digital Frequency Modulation downlink signals. The GDT acquire the transmitted signals to permit continuous display of Joint STARS sensor information at the ground stations.  The ADT also receives KU-band digital upli nk signals from the GDT.  This system employs anti-jam features and encryption/decryption.  Detailed technical data is not available for the GDT, spares, or repair.  Suppliers capable of furnishing spares and providing the depot logistic support must respo nd by writing to Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-C-JS, Building 1201E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.
