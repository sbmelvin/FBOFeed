Description
This is a presolicitation notice to potential offerors to privatize the wastewater distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, treatment plants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the wastewater collection system privatization are the oil/water separators, and grease traps.
	The wastewater collection system serves both the 914th AW and the 107th ARW. The wastewater collection system on the base contains both gravity and pressure flow sewer mains. Most of the collection system on the 914th ARW side of the base is PVC. In the early 1990s, a section of PVC pipe was installed as force main on the 914th side of the base. The wastewater collection system on the 107th side of the base consists of PVC pipe that was installed in 1996. Laterals connecting the buildings to the collection mains are typically cast iron and were installed with the buildings during the 1950s.
	Wastewater collection pipe diameter ranges from 3 to 12 inches. There are two wastewater collection pump stations on the Niagara Falls ARS and about 101 access manholes. Wastewater from the base is discharged through pump station 731 into a PVC force main to a manhole on collection main beneath Walmore Road east of the base. The receiving manhole belongs to Niagara County Sewer District No. 1. The wastewater for the entire base is metered at the Pump Station, Facility 731.
Wastewater discharge volumes are measured at the discharge pump station in building 731 on the Niagara Falls ARS wastewater system. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 reported the wastewater discharge to be 40 million gallons in 1994. In 1998, the base owned flow meter records show that 37 million gallons were discharged from the base. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 invoices the base for wastewater based on the meter in the pump station.
In calendar year 1998, the average monthly discharge was 3 million gallons per month. Peak discharge occurred in March 1998 at 6.7 million gallons, and the minimum monthly discharge was 1.4 million gallons in November. A net decrease in the square footage of buildings on the base is expected within the next 5 years as planned demolitions are completed. As a result, future wastewater system demand should decrease.
The 914th AW was issued an industrial waste permit with the Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 that expired June 1, 2000. Renewal of this permit was applied for by the 914th CEV.  Future permit renewals will be applied for by the 914th CEV.
	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.
	The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 914th Airlift Wing (AW) of the Air Force Reserve and the 107th Airlift Wing (AW) of the New York Air National Guard.  The 914th AW is the host unit at the Niagara Falls ARS and the 107th AW is the largest tenant.  The installation is located approximately 6 miles east of Niagara Falls, New York and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York.  The installation occupies 985 acres on the north side part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York.  The installation leases 38.71 acres from the People of the State of New York and 37.1 acres from the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority.    
The 914th AW has an economic impact of over $91 million on the surrounding area.  The working population consists of 1,245 military and 501 civilian personnel.  The 914th AW’s mission is to provide airland and aerial delivery of troops, supplies, and equipment using C-130 H-3 Hercules cargo aircraft carriers.  The base occupies 82 buildings on the Niagara Falls ARS including 62 buildings dedicated to industrial activities and 20 to administrative activities.  
The 107th AW has an economic impact of over $49 million on the surrounding area.  The working population consists of 585 military personnel, and 215 civilians.  The 107th occupies 22 buildings on the Niagara Falls ARS including 16 buildings dedicated to industrial activities and 6 to administrative activities.  
The 107th AW’s mission recently changed to become directly connected to that of the 914th.  The 107th now works alongside the Air Force Reserve's 914th Airlift Wing as part of the Air Force Reserve's "Associate" concept. In an associate base, units share people, resources and processes to accomplish their flying missions. "Team Niagara" features the 914th as host to the 107th with both units flying reserve C-130 H2s.  
The Niagara Falls International Airport opened in 1928 and was joined by the military in 1946.  The base has expanded several times over the years.  The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.   A 25,000-square foot expansion on the Armed Forces Reserve Center (AFRC) is currently under construction.

The Niagara Falls ARS water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, exterior backflow devices, pumps, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:
•	Water Pump Building 729
•	Multi-Use Building 891 
•	Fire Protection Mains – water mains exiting building 828
•	Fire Protection Water Reservoir – located in building 828
•	Fire Pump Building 828
•	Post Indicator Valves

	The Niagara Falls ARS receives water from the City of Niagara Falls, the Town of Wheatfield, and the Town of Niagara.  The main water supply, provided by the City of Niagara Falls, enters the installation at the southeast corner through a 10-inch diameter asbestos cement pipe.  It passes through a City of Niagara Falls owned master meter and installation owned backflow preventers in Building 729 before entering the installation’s distribution system.  Ownership of the distribution system starts at the demand side of the master meter.  Building 729 will be retained by the Installation after privatization but access will be granted to the new owner.  
	The secondary water supply, provided by the Town of Wheatfield, enters the installation through an automatic pressure sensitive valve near the main gate on Lockport Road. The valve automatically opens when the pressure in the installation’s distribution system drops below 50 psig.  The water line passes through an installation owned meter and backflow preventers in Building 891 before entering the distribution system.  Ownership of the Town of Wheatfield line begins at the connection to the water main in Lockport Road.  Building 891 will remain property of the Air Force, but access will be provided to the new owner. 
	The third water supply, provided by the Town of Niagara, enters the Fire Training Area through a 6-inch pipe that connects to the Town of Niagara Main on Lockport Road.  Ownership of the water line from the Town of Niagara to the Fire Training Area begins at the property line.  The line passes through a Town of Niagara owned master meter and installation owned backflow preventers in the metering pit.  The Fire Training Area is independent of the Niagara Falls ARS’ distribution system and fire protection system. 
	The Niagara Falls ARS’ water distribution pipes consist  of copper, ductile iron, cast iron, steel, PVC, and asbestos cement on the 914th AW’s side and PVC, with smaller amounts of cast iron and transite on the 107th AW’s side.  Expansions and repairs to the 914th AW’s system have replaced part of the original pipes with PVC and ductile iron. Tracer wire was installed with the PVC pipe at the 107th AW.  The estimated range of pipe depth at the installation is 4 to 8 feet below the ground surface but actual depth may vary and approximately 5 percent of the pipes are assumed to pass under pavement.  The secondary water meters will be included in the privatization contract, including those located inside buildings.  The buildings will remain Air Force property but access will be granted to the meter locations.
	The original pipe appears to be in good condition from the perspective that it is not clogging or corroding. However, the pipe beneath the 914th AW has reachedthe end of its useful life. Plans for replacing the water distribution mains on the 914th AW are completed, but a contract to complete the project has not been awarded.  
Niagara Falls ARS acquires potable water from the City of Niagara Falls. The Town of Wheatfield provides emergency water service to the water system if the pressure in the base system drops to an unacceptable level.
The FY 2007 annual water consumption was 32,325kgal.  The average monthly usage was 2,694kgal. The peak monthly demand recorded in this period was 3,400kgal per month (over a 3-month period). The minimum monthly demand was 2,164kgal per month (over a 3-month period).
The city of Niagara Falls provides more than 95 percent of the water used on base. The quantity of water supplied by the Town of Wheatfield varies from one year to the next depending upon the number of times the pressure drops within the main system. 


	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.
	The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&amp;D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2009.1, which will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Nov 12, 2008. The 2009.1 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Dec 8, 2008 and will close at 6:00 AM Eastern Time, Jan 14, 2009. NOTE: Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Seven DoD components will participate in the 2009.1 solicitation - the Department of the Air Force, Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBD), and United Stated Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The solicitation lists all the R&amp;D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal. Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept. If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept. Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at &lsquo;http://www.dodsbir.net/submission' following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying. Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early. The complete solicitation may be accessed at &lsquo;http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation'. Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms. Questions may be directed to the SBIR/STTR Help Desk at (866) 724-7457 or Mr. Michael Caccuitto at (703) 588-8610, or by e-mail: michael.caccuitto@osd.mil or Ms. Amy Smith, Contracting Officer at (937) 255-0493, e-mail amy.smith@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>BACKGROUND - The Port Authority of Guam (PAG) is planning and conducting a variety of modernization activities to enhance the transportation of goods and people within the Territory of Guam and to improve and expand needed services to its citizens and the military.  Potential modernization activities are scheduled to occur over approximately the next ten years using Federal, non-federal, and private funds administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration.  Expansion objectives include, but are not limited to:	Expansion of commercial dock space,	Providing facilities necessary to support rapid military deployment from western pacific military bases,	Additional bulk and break-bulk capacity,	New Gate Processing System,	New Terminal Information Technology Systems,	Warehouse demolition,	Utility improvements,	Road connections to Commercial Port,	Improved terminal operations, layout, and traffic flow, and	Acquisition, installation, and operation of security equipment and services.
The Maritime Administration, working with the PAG intends to initiate implementation of this expansion program through multiple projects to accomplish multiple goals in a relatively short time period.  To meet the goals of the modernization program, the Port must: ensure funding, evaluate various niche market opportunities, perform programming and planning, devise and manage multiple interrelated schedules, coordinate with the community, obtain environmental permits and records of decision, manage design and construction activities, direct and oversee contractor activities, interface with the major stakeholders, acquire Port Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and security equipment and services, and maintain budgets and program progress.   Accomplishment of all of these activities within a finite timeframe represents a significant challenge for the Maritime Administration and PAG.
To meet this challenge, a Contract is required for program management, environmental support, engineering and design services, and construction management for the duration of the modernization and expansion process.  The objective of this contract scope of work is to provide the contractual framework that addresses specific management needs while also providing contractual and technical flexibility to address a range of services that may be required.  This contract scope of work defines the types of services to be provided through an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract under which individual task orders (TOs) can be issued as needed. 
The contractor will provide technical management, and staff augmentation support services, as directed by TOs, for the duration of the project.  These services will be within the following general categories: program management, port planning and conceptual engineering, environmental documentation and permitting, design management, construction management, and coordination with and support to the Department of Defense as may be required.  These service categories are briefly described below.  The descriptions are not intended to represent each and every type of service that may be provided under this contract.  As such, they should not be construed as limiting the nature or breadth of services that might eventually be included under this contract. 
 Program Management Services.  As directed in specific TOs, the contractor's team will provide the expertise needed to establish, operate, and maintain an effective Program Management Office (PMO) to support general Port modernization activities. The PMO will be proactive with the Maritime Administration and PAG staff to identify and address program management issues and to develop and implement administrative, technical, and public relations strategies that will promote the success of the program. The PMO will consist of a small group of key personnel to provide seamless communication with the Maritime Administration, PAG, and other key individuals. Personnel in the PMO should include a Program Manager, Contracts/Subcontracts Specialist, Information Technology Specialist, Budget/Schedule Specialist, Engineers, and others determined to be necessary by the Maritime Administration and the PAG.
The Maritime Administration, as advised by PAG, intends to issue TOs to the contractor, as part of the Program Management Services, to perform the following actions: 
	Develop and maintain a Program Management Plan and Master Schedule.	Provide agency coordination and consultation.	Perform program administration (e.g., budget monitoring, contracting/subcontracting, office management,                and accounting).	Manage cost control.	Monitor and report on status.	Maintain document control and record keeping.	Conduct community outreach/public involvement.                Ensure Quality Assurance/Quality Control.	Perform other activities as directed in task orders by the Maritime Administration.
The solicitation will be issued on or about November 25, 2008.

<DESC>The National Children’s Study is a major longitudinal cohort study that will follow children from before birth to at least 21 years of age and will evaluate the effects of a variety of environmental factors, including chemical, physical, biological, and psychosocial factors, on children’s health and well-being.  Researchers will analyze how these elements interact with each other and what helpful and/or harmful effects they might have on children’s health.  Data will be collected from children and their families from different areas of the country, from varied backgrounds, and of different family types. 

In order to study the main hypotheses for the National Children’s Study (NCS), a variety of data will be collected from participants, including biological specimens.  Biospecimens from a potential mother, father, and/or child will either be collected by a data collector or self-collected by the participant and will take place at defined time periods or visits during the study. Study Centers from across the nation will manage the data collection within their area and will work with the Program Office (National Institute of Child Health and Disease (NICHD), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) and the Coordinating Center (Westat) to meet the needs of the study.  The study will begin with 7 Study locations but will add on Study Centers and locations over the first 11 years of the study to reach 105 Study locations with work performed in approximately 40 Centers.

The purpose of this work is to generate pooled biological samples for quality assessment of the collection and storage processes and the laboratory testing.  With a longitudinal study of this magnitude, it is essential that good quality assurance processes are established for obtaining and measuring all analytes.  The creation of the pools will be especially important during the analysis phase of the NCS as laboratories perform testing on the biospecimens. To this end, the Study plans to create normal pools of various human body fluids to facilitate the monitoring of laboratory testing.

In addition, the purpose of the SEDI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is to help the Department address “How” to accomplish program goals and objectives by the spiral insertion of new technologies, experimental prototypes, and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware into new and existing operational systems and platforms.  The program risk must be carefully managed to tight cost and schedule constraints while maintaining critical performance requirements.  Within the context of the scope and concept for the FFRDC, the SEDI will provide the government with the necessary expertise to provide best “lifecycle” value while promoting fair and open systems acquisitions and deployments through specific core competencies.  The contract will support requirements for DHS component organizations and will be administered by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) has the mission to conduct ballistic tests of various armors and armaments to determine the suitability, effectiveness, lethality and survivability of the system under test. The Light Armor Range Complex (LARC) was constructed to support this mission in the 1940's.  Various additions and range improvements have been made over the years, but new expansion is now required, and the Army intends to purchase and install new Modular Firing Ranges to meet emerging requirements.  One stringent requirement of the new ranges will be the ability to continuously monitor and control the test environment, specifically, the temperature and humidity within the firing ranges and test control rooms.

<DESC>You are cordially invited to attend the GSA / Lodging Industry Outreach Day on Friday, November 14, 2008 from 10:00 am to 12 noon at the General Services Administration's (GSA) office at 2200 Crystal Drive in Crystal City, Virginia.

GSA’s vision is to acquire, either through the GSA Schedule 599-3 or through a full and open competition, an outsourced program that is easy to use, consumer market driven and provides the traveler with their preferred hotel choices, quality properties in the right locations, at a fair price and FEMA compliant. The model will be able to generate revenue to fund the required resources.

It’s estimated that the Federal government consumes 22 million room nights per year although data is limited to transactions purchased with the SmartPay travel card. The FedRooms® brand and program have been in the market approximately three years.  While the program provides proven benefits and over 6,500 participating hotels, it has been under utilized. The challenge and opportunity for the future is to increase utilization to capture savings and service benefits which will be discussed at this meeting.

Please R.S.V.P. with your name and affiliation to Karina Bojorge at Karina.Bojorge@gsa.gov so that we can submit your information to security and expedite your check in process. 

Please arrive by 9:30 am so you can pass through the security check point in time for the start of the meeting at 10:00 am.  A photo ID will be required by security to be admitted.

<SUBJECT>Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) TRAIN 21 e-Learning Capability
<SOLNBR>HSFLGL-09-I-00001
<RESPDATE>112108
<CONTACT>Joe Troia, Contracting Officer, Phone 912-267-2166, Email joe.troia@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>This Request for Information (RFI) is an announcement only for purposes of conducting market research. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Nothing in this notice shall be construed as a commitment or obligation by the Government to conduct further actions as a result of this notification.</p>
<p>Background: The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), a Component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is exploring the potential for transforming current training delivery methods used to provide training to federal law enforcement officers. This includes developing a next generation learning system that will provide the optimum mix of live, virtual and digital learning capabilities to support residential and non-residential training of law enforcement officers. This transformational next-generation learning environment is the focus of a proposed FLETC program that has been designated as &ldquo;TRAIN 21.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TRAIN 21 will seek to increase FLETC&rsquo;s capability to meet the growing demand for basic, advanced, and specialized law enforcement training. This could involve: (1) complete redesign of traditional residential training programs to implement &ldquo;blended training,&rdquo; (2) distance learning by remote groups of students, (3) online continuing education courses, and (4) learning resources such as libraries, webcasts, and podcasts. The term blended training applies to developing the best mix of classroom, practice, collaborative learning, live and virtual simulation, and online learning to achieve quality outcomes for students and their law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The next generation learning system encompassed in TRAIN 21 seeks to achieve quality learning outcomes through the use of a technically reliable and cost-efficient information technology infrastructure. When proven successful in a law enforcement training environment, e-Learning will ultimately support many classrooms, multiple campuses, and remote locations. TRAIN 21 is in the early conceptual planning phase focusing on developing detailed plans, prototypes, a proof-of-concept, and a long-term implementation roadmap. The FLETC seeks assistance from an experienced organization in the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify best practices in blended learning that can be applied to the unique requirements of training.</p>
<p>&bull; Redesign training and knowledge resources to provide technology-enhanced learning opportunities.</p>
<p>&bull; Support prototype activities with small-scale implementations of blended learning technology solutions.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate and optimize the outcomes in terms of training quality, instructor and student satisfaction, technology integration, and cost efficiency.</p>
<p>&bull; Align TRAIN 21 technology with DHS Enterprise Architecture and Information Security requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop detailed plans and specifications for larger-scale implementation of validated digital learning and delivery capabilities. This will include a prioritization of the course material in the FLETC curriculum for transition to the use of the TRAIN 21 blended learning technologies.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide the FLETC Executive Team with a roadmap/blue print for the long-term evolution of e-Learning.</p>
<p>Both instructional and technology solutions must be capable of implementation in an environment that complies with the DHS enterprise architecture and information security requirements. It must also interface with more than 80 Federal Partner Organizations and support diverse state, local, tribal, and other law enforcement agencies. FLETC currently trains more than 60,000 students annually.</p>
<p>When pilot/prototype activities ultimately prove successful, FLETC may implement the digital learning capability incrementally over multiple years. A phased development process would be used to design, integrate, test, and validate each increment. Collaboration with instructors and partner organizations, as well as the quality of training outcomes for students will cause the development process to be evolutionary.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from potential sources with proven track records developing and implementing research-based processes for determining the best blended learning delivery method for training content. This RFI is seeking to determine whether organizations exist that have experience in developing the following:</p>
<p>1. Advice about e-Learning &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; that (a) have been successful in higher education, defense, and/or other settings and (b) have the potential for applicability to law enforcement training.</p>
<p>2. Support for a training organization in a collaborative planning and training redesign process based on those e-Learning &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; involving instructors, IT specialists, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>3. Recommendations for solutions that support quality learning outcomes and cost-effective technology.</p>
<p>4. Support for a training organization by assisting in the design and development of pilot training and learning solutions.</p>
<p>5. Documentation of training and technology prototypes that can serve as &ldquo;blueprints&rdquo; for larger-scale future implementations.</p>
<p>6. Detailed plans and specifications for long-term acquisition of TRAIN 21 capabilities.</p>
<p>7. Support the Executive Team of a training organization with a road map for the long-term evolution of e-Learning in a major, multi-campus training environment.</p>
<p>Company Information: Please provide, at a minimum, the following organizational information:</p>
<p>1. Name and physical address of organization.</p>
<p>2. Name and title of point of contact, including telephone number and e-mail address.</p>
<p>3. Organizational data (i.e., Size, DUNS, Socio-economic status, GSA Schedules, etc.).</p>
<p>4. Additional Information:</p>
<p>4.1 What experience and capabilities does your organization/team have that could support FLETC during the detailed planning, prototyping and development phase?</p>
<p>4.2 What are the qualifications of your alternative training delivery experts in advising large institutions about the planning and implementation of e-Learning programs?</p>
<p>4.3 Provide a list of federal and non-federal clients.</p>
<p>4.4 Provide past experience summary paragraphs for up to three most relevant projects including client name, dates of services, a brief identification of the scope of work, and the total dollar value of services.</p>
<p>Submittals: Responses shall limited to a maximum of 10 pages.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information (RFI), this is a RFI.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request nor to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18,  Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. B – Although ‘proposal’ and ‘vendor’ are used in this Request for Information, your responsibility will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is supporting an effort where the overarching objective of this acquisition effort is to obtain information on existing event management systems for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). 

The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Office of Congressional and public Affairs (CP) has an immediate requirement to automate and centralize its events management and scheduling processes. DIA CP current events management, to include planning, tracking  and archiving of events related to Congressional affairs, public affairs, and all US VIP visitors to DIA is done using a variety of methods including spreadsheets, calendar tools, shared drives and other office applications, making agency-wide visibility of events, archiving and metrics a laborious and time-consuming task. A centralized automated approach is necessary to provide DIA CP decision makers accurate and up-to-date information in real time to achieve this objective. 

DIA seeks information on existing event management systems that address the following performance parameters/characteristics:

•	A robust, web-enabled relational database application for all DIA engagements with key customers, to include Congress, the media, US VIP visitors, and government military and civilian organizations.
 
•	 A comprehensive, web-based calendar capability that reflects all past, present and future engagements and interaction across DIA organizations which can then be emailed/exported to DIA customers.
 
•	Ability to attach, file and manage documents, audio files and video clips and pertinent appendices associated with specific events and engagements. 

•	An archiving and advanced key word search capability that allows for rapid search and retrieval of data, displaying summary of events and ability to easily develop metrics on historical engagements. 

•	A tailored, automated feed to the web-based repository that includes comprehensive knowledge of Congressional activities, including biographics on Congressional members, Committee assignments, Committee staff and contact information, floor activity, and status of legislation.  

The solution/system must contain sufficient configuration flexibility to achieve all stated functionality; this may include customization of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products to accomplish this functionality.

Interested parties must submit information on available systems not later than 4:00 pm (est.) 25 November 2008 to the following email addresses:  Antoinette.Ingram@dia.mil and/or Maria.Kersey@dia.mil. Submittals may not exceed ten (10) pages, with Times New Roman 12 fonts. All submittals should be addressed to Virginia Contracting Authority, or designated Official at: Building 6000, Bulling AFB, Washington, DC.  Capability package format is left to the discretion of the sources.  Only written inquiries will be accepted with regard to this notice, therefore, telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends tosolicit and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee, indefinite-deliveryindefinite-quantity contract to Science Applications International Corporation(SAIC), of 10210 Campus Point Drive San Diego, CA  92121 on a sole sourcebasis.  The purpose of this action is to complete the research and developmentrequirements for composite technology in container security.  This action is afollow-on to a previous contract with SAIC, N66001-05-C-6013, awarded under thecompetitive Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency (HSARPA) BroadAgency Announcement (BAA) 04-06 published on 7 May 2004.  The government seeksthe completion effort of the development, test, and prototype of the AdvancedContainer Security Device (ACSD) and Container Security Device (CSD). The ACSDconsists of sensors that detect and warn of intrusion on any of the six sides,door openings, or the presence of human cargo.  All ACSD development has beenunder N66001-05-C-6013. A subset of the ACSD capabilities is the CSD, whichspecifically detects an unauthorized opening of a container door.  Thetechnology used by SAIC for the CSD was developed under N66001-05-C-6013(mentioned above) as well as United States Army contract W91-CRB-04-D-0015,task order 0032.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  SAICs experience andcontainer technology makes it the only source that would not result in theduplication of cost to the government.  All responsible sources may submit acapability statement which will be considered by SSC Pacific.  If it isdetermined that sources other than SAIC can successfully meet this requirementwithout substantial duplication of cost to the government, the sole sourceacquisition strategy will be reconsidered.  Questions concerning this solesource contract action may be directed to Christopher J. Murr atChristopher.j.murr@navy.mil.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitations and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This procurement is for the purchase of an all inclusive system for analysis of data, amplifiers for the acquisition of data from transducers which will measure force, pressure, blood pressure, respiration, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. The intended source is BioPac Systems, Inc., MP150 system, with compatible amplifiers, transducers, and Acknowledge software. Also purchased with the system is Samba Sensors Micro-pressure monitor and transducers. A listing of the actual items is attached to this synopsis.<br />The Samba Sensors micro-pressure monitor is an &lsquo;ultra miniature' high-precision pressure monitoring instrument, which monitors precise pressure responses quickly. The transducer consists of a silicon sensor element, 0.42 mm in diameter, bonded to an optical fiber 0.25 mm to 0.40 mm diameter. It is imperative that the transducer be small so as to avoid traumatizing nearby tissue, which may exacerbate compartment syndrome creating anomalous data. Also, the Samba monitor is a two channel monitor, which means two extremities can be measured at one time, which is imperative for our study as we are measuring on experimental limb pressure and one control limb pressure. For this study, it will be necessary to compare both blood pressure and compartmental pressure to one another. Utilizing the same monitor for measuring blood pressure and inter-compartmental pressure reduces variations in data and provides highly accurate results.<br /><strong>This is an intention to purchase this system from a Sole Source</strong>. The solicitation document and incorporate provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-27 (effective 17 October 2008) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement change notice 20081020.

It is the offeror's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. The delivery date of these items is 2 weeks after receipt of Order (WARO), FOB Destination, Brooks City-Base, TX. <br />The NAICS Code is 334111 the size standard is 1,000 employees.

D. Introduction and Background:  

The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative is the largest commitment ever by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease. Its first phase is a five-year, $15 billion, multifaceted approach to combating the disease in more than 100 countries around the world.  The strategy places particular emphasis on 15 focus countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia (including Vietnam) that represent approximately half the world’s infections.  In these 15 countries, PEPFAR aims to treat two million HIV-infected individuals, prevent seven million new infections and to provide care and support for ten million HIV-infected individuals and orphans.  

Vietnam became the 15th focus country of the Emergency Plan in June 2004.  Under the Emergency Plan, Vietnam received $18 million in FY04, $28 million in FY05, $34 million in FY06, and $66 million in FY07 to support a comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care program.   The FY08 budget is approximately $89 million. Funding levels allocated to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for this period were $19 million in FY04, $17 million in FY05, $20 million in FY06, $40 million in FY07 and about $47 million in FY08.

The PEPFAR targets established for Vietnam are to prevent 610,000 new infections, to provide care services for 110,000 people and to provide ARV treatment for 22,000 people by fiscal year 2008.

The USG response in Vietnam includes a focus both on communities and on the public sector to:

•	Assist Vietnam to develop comprehensive models of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support and associated networks to include medicine assisted therapy for IV drug users and substance abuse reduction.
•	Support efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and people affected by HIV/AIDS and advocate for greater involvement of PLWHA at all levels of HIV/AIDS program development, implementation and monitoring.
•	Train Vietnamese clinicians in HIV/AIDS care and treatment, counseling and support, and consistent use of standard operating procedures and routine monitoring.
•	Assist the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop targeted peer outreach for Most-at-Risk-Populations (MARPs), voluntary HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (VCT) sites, and outpatient clinics as part of the referral network.
•	Increase the public health management capacity of Vietnamese government workers.
•	Assist the MOH to develop a national HIV reference laboratory, including quality assurance and quality control systems. 
•	Provide technical assistance on the development of the National HIV/AIDS Law protecting the rights of PLWHA.
•	Assist in the development of care and treatment coordination unit within the MOH by funding a care and treatment coordination position in the unit.
•	Provide support in establishing one national surveillance and monitoring and evaluation system at the national and local levels.

A consortium of USG agencies is charged with coordinating and managing PEPFAR under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassador.  These agencies include USAID, the Department of State, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HHS/CDC), and the Department of Defense (DoD).  The goal is to develop and implement one coherent USG HIV/AIDS program in Vietnam combining the comparative strengths and capabilities of all the government agencies.  The Chief of Mission (COM) provides overall guidance to the interagency team and the PEPFAR Coordination Office facilitates complementarities among the various activities by the USG agencies, host government and other HIV/AIDS donors in Vietnam.

<DESC>This AMENDMENT to the COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION responds to vendor questions submitted as of Nov 10, 2008, and extends the CLOSING DATE.  The final Due Date for questions remains Nov 12, 2008 at 12:00pm EST.
Official Portrait for DOI Secretary Dirk KempthorneRFQ NBC09LCK01Vendor Questions and Government Responses
1.     Earlier in this year, I had been contacted / provided information concerning my technical capabilities, references, and prints of previously painted portraits for the Department of Interior's review.  Will it be necessary to resubmit this information again, along with a price quote? 
Answer:  Yes.  As this requirement is being officially competed, all quotes MUST be submitted in response to the RFQ posted in order to be considered for award.  The evaluators of quotes at this point will most likely be different than in the initial planning stages.  A complete quote in accordance with the posted solicitation is required; however it's acceptable to re-submit information previously provided.
2.     When will the DOI make the official announcement for the award of Secretary Kempthorne's portrait?
Answer:  The official award will be made after all proposals are evaluated by the program office, which will make a recommendation for award decision to my office.  The length of time is highly dependant on the number of proposals received and the schedules of the evaluator(s).
3.     Are you requesting that the portfolio be submitted to you electronically or via regular mail / courier?
Answer:  The original intent of the solicitation was for fully electronic quotes.  However, the Government recognizes portfolio prints may be of higher quality if submitted in hard copy.  Therefore portfolios may be either emailed or hard copies of portfolios may be sent to ATTN: Lauren Kunze at the address listed in the FedBizOpps posting (under Contracting Office Address).  ***Due to mail security restrictions, please arrange for delivery in-person, or via FedEx, as regular posted mail is subject to scans which will damage photos or prints.***  Please be aware that all submissions necessary for the quote must be received by the Government by the due date, so sending early would be preferable.  One copy of prints for your portfolio will be sufficient.
As a result of this change, the DUE DATE for this solicitation is EXTENDED until 4:00 PM EST on MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2008.  No further extensions are anticipated.  All other terms and requirements of the original solicitation remain unchanged.
The Due Date for Questions remains 12:00pm EST on November 12.  Any further questions received before that time will be answered via a second solicitation amendment at this location.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS CANCELLED as of 11/10/08This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations and Conference Space, located in the downtown (or within 4-blocks of reasonably priced restaurants) in WASHINGTON, DC area (which includes Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax, VA, the counties of Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun in VA, and the counties of Montgomery, Prince Georges in MD). Hotel MUST be within walking distance up to 4 blocks of a Metro Station for several local attendees.    Request for Proposal VA-777-09-RP-0018 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services or 3rd Party Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.  (Again, this is NOT a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable).  This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-26, Effective 12 Jun 2008 and VAAR 97-10.  NAICS Code 721110 and the small business size standard is $7M, respectively.  This BOS announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued.  The Period of Performance for this requirement will be September 14-15, 2009.  An estimated 95 (peak night) sleeping rooms and the required meeting space MUST be housed in the same facility.  The Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA), Employee Education System (EES) is sponsoring a conference titled, MS Center of Excellence Joint Council Meeting.  The hotel shall accommodate 98 sleeping rooms, checking in Sunday, September 13, 2009, checking out Wednesday, September 16, 2009; and shall provide all requirements specified for conference needs in Parts A, B and C below, and lodging rates MUST be within the Government Per Diem rate or lower for the area.  A response to requirements listed shall be submitted on letterhead and must address all requirements listed in a separate technical proposal.   A full Hotel Contract shall be submitted with your proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, and menus.  To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the hotel facility MUST be listed with current status on the Central Contractor Registration website (www.ccr.gov) and be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at (www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm).

Description
This is a solicitation for potential offerors interetested in privatizing the natural gas distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  
The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point where the distribution system enters the Installation, and Government ownership starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are the 107th Air Refueling Wing natural gas mains and laterals. Approximately 7,360 linear feet of polyethylene pipe supply natural gas to 16 buildings on the 107th ARW. These lines are owned by National Fuels Gas.  
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate natural gas distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. National Fuel Gas Company supplies natural gas to both systems. Within the boundary of 107th ARW, the gas distribution mains and laterals are owned by National Fuels Gas so they are not included in this offering. The natural gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base contains polyethylene pipe and iron pipe. The pipe sizes vary from 1 inch to 6 inches in diameter. 
Gas enters the 914th natural gas distribution system at the main entrance on Lockport Road. It is delivered through a pressure regulator that drops the pressure to about 5 psi for distribution through the 914th AW owned system. Roughly 3/4 of the gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base was replaced with new polyethylene pipe before 1999. Roughly 40 percent of the laterals were replaced; the remaining laterals are about the same age as the buildings they feed. A project to replace the remaining iron part of the gas main (installed in the 1950's and has reached the end of its useful life) is planned but not funded at this time. Gas is measured at the bulk meter near the regulator at the entrance to the site.
Inventories will be included in the RFP.
The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

Description
This is a solicitation notice to potential offerors to privatize the water distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY.

The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 914th Airlift Wing (AW) of the Air Force Reserve and the 107th Airlift Wing (AW) of the New York Air National Guard.  The 914th AW is the host unit at the Niagara Falls ARS and the 107th AW is the largest tenant.  The installation is located approximately 6 miles east of Niagara Falls, New York and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York.  The installation occupies 985 acres on the north side part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York.  The installation leases 38.71 acres from the People of the State of New York and 37.1 acres from the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority.    
The 914th AW has an economic impact of over $91 million on the surrounding area.  The working population consists of 1,245 military and 501 civilian personnel.  The 914th AW’s mission is to provide airland and aerial delivery of troops, supplies, and equipment using C-130 H-3 Hercules cargo aircraft carriers.  The base occupies 82 buildings on the Niagara Falls ARS including 62 buildings dedicated to industrial activities and 20 to administrative activities.  
The 107th AW has an economic impact of over $49 million on the surrounding area.  The working population consists of 585 military personnel, and 215 civilians.  The 107th occupies 22 buildings on the Niagara Falls ARS including 16 buildings dedicated to industrial activities and 6 to administrative activities.  
The 107th AW’s mission recently changed to become directly connected to that of the 914th.  The 107th now works alongside the Air Force Reserve's 914th Airlift Wing as part of the Air Force Reserve's "Associate" concept. In an associate base, units share people, resources and processes to accomplish their flying missions. "Team Niagara" features the 914th as host to the 107th with both units flying reserve C-130 H2s.  
The Niagara Falls International Airport opened in 1928 and was joined by the military in 1946.  The base has expanded several times over the years.  The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.   A 25,000-square foot expansion on the Armed Forces Reserve Center (AFRC) is currently under construction.

The Niagara Falls ARS water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, exterior backflow devices, pumps, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:
•	Water Pump Building 729
•	Multi-Use Building 891 
•	Fire Protection Mains – water mains exiting building 828
•	Fire Protection Water Reservoir – located in building 828
•	Fire Pump Building 828
•	Post Indicator Valves

	The Niagara Falls ARS receives water from the City of Niagara Falls, the Town of Wheatfield, and the Town of Niagara.  The main water supply, provided by the City of Niagara Falls, enters the installation at the southeast corner through a 10-inch diameter asbestos cement pipe.  It passes through a City of Niagara Falls owned master meter and installation owned backflow preventers in Building 729 before entering the installation’s distribution system.  Ownership of the distribution system starts at the demand side of the master meter.  Building 729 will be retained by the Installation after privatization but access will be granted to the new owner.  
	The secondary water supply, provided by the Town of Wheatfield, enters the installation through an automatic pressure sensitive valve near the main gate on Lockport Road. The valve automatically opens when the pressure in the installation’s distribution system drops below 50 psig.  The water line passes through an installation owned meter and backflow preventers in Building 891 before entering the distribution system.  Ownership of the Town of Wheatfield line begins at the connection to the water main in Lockport Road.  Building 891 will remain property of the Air Force, but access will be provided to the new owner. 
	The third water supply, provided by the Town of Niagara, enters the Fire Training Area through a 6-inch pipe that connects to the Town of Niagara Main on Lockport Road.  Ownership of the water line from the Town of Niagara to the Fire Training Area begins at the property line.  The line passes through a Town of Niagara owned master meter and installation owned backflow preventers in the metering pit.  The Fire Training Area is independent of the Niagara Falls ARS’ distribution system and fire protection system. 
	The Niagara Falls ARS’ water distribution pipes consist  of copper, ductile iron, cast iron, steel, PVC, and asbestos cement on the 914th AW’s side and PVC, with smaller amounts of cast iron and transite on the 107th AW’s side.  Expansions and repairs to the 914th AW’s system have replaced part of the original pipes with PVC and ductile iron. Tracer wire was installed with the PVC pipe at the 107th AW.  The estimated range of pipe depth at the installation is 4 to 8 feet below the ground surface but actual depth may vary and approximately 5 percent of the pipes are assumed to pass under pavement.  The secondary water meters will be included in the privatization contract, including those located inside buildings.  The buildings will remain Air Force property but access will be granted to the meter locations.
	The original pipe appears to be in good condition from the perspective that it is not clogging or corroding. However, the pipe beneath the 914th AW has reachedthe end of its useful life. Plans for replacing the water distribution mains on the 914th AW are completed, but a contract to complete the project has not been awarded.  
Niagara Falls ARS acquires potable water from the City of Niagara Falls. The Town of Wheatfield provides emergency water service to the water system if the pressure in the base system drops to an unacceptable level.
The FY 2007 annual water consumption was 32,325kgal.  The average monthly usage was 2,694kgal. The peak monthly demand recorded in this period was 3,400kgal per month (over a 3-month period). The minimum monthly demand was 2,164kgal per month (over a 3-month period).
The city of Niagara Falls provides more than 95 percent of the water used on base. The quantity of water supplied by the Town of Wheatfield varies from one year to the next depending upon the number of times the pressure drops within the main system. 


	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.
	The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, treatment plants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the wastewater collection system privatization are the oil/water separators, and grease traps.
	The wastewater collection system serves both the 914th AW and the 107th ARW. The wastewater collection system on the base contains both gravity and pressure flow sewer mains. Most of the collection system on the 914th ARW side of the base is PVC. In the early 1990s, a section of PVC pipe was installed as force main on the 914th side of the base. The wastewater collection system on the 107th side of the base consists of PVC pipe that was installed in 1996. Laterals connecting the buildings to the collection mains are typically cast iron and were installed with the buildings during the 1950s.
	Wastewater collection pipe diameter ranges from 3 to 12 inches. There are two wastewater collection pump stations on the Niagara Falls ARS and about 101 access manholes. Wastewater from the base is discharged through pump station 731 into a PVC force main to a manhole on collection main beneath Walmore Road east of the base. The receiving manhole belongs to Niagara County Sewer District No. 1. The wastewater for the entire base is metered at the Pump Station, Facility 731.
Wastewater discharge volumes are measured at the discharge pump station in building 731 on the Niagara Falls ARS wastewater system. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 reported the wastewater discharge to be 40 million gallons in 1994. In 1998, the base owned flow meter records show that 37 million gallons were discharged from the base. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 invoices the base for wastewater based on the meter in the pump station.
In calendar year 1998, the average monthly discharge was 3 million gallons per month. Peak discharge occurred in March 1998 at 6.7 million gallons, and the minimum monthly discharge was 1.4 million gallons in November. A net decrease in the square footage of buildings on the base is expected within the next 5 years as planned demolitions are completed. As a result, future wastewater system demand should decrease.
The 914th AW was issued an industrial waste permit with the Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 that expired June 1, 2000. Renewal of this permit was applied for by the 914th CEV.  Future permit renewals will be applied for by the 914th CEV.
	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.

<DESC>This amendment changes the RFP due date from November 21, 2008 to December 5, 2008


Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC, (BSA) under Contract DE-AC02-98CH10886, for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), herewith solicits your proposal for the Conventional Facilities construction of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).

PROJECT INFORMATION
The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a Ring Building of approximately 392,000 square feet. 

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of the NSLS-II and will house offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities. 

The proposed construction type for the Ring building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for the upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior. Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin or membrane roof systems. 

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines, and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces. Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete, with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines. The NSLS-II Ring Building has been designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces. Additionally, the building design minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator, and laboratory spaces by the routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment. There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline and certain laboratory spaces that will require a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

This acquisition is a "Best Value" procurement.   Best Value employs a trade-off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror. BSA will evaluate proposals, in accordance with the following six criteria: contractor safety record and program, past performance in comparable work, key project personnel, major subcontractor safety and performance record, project management and quality assurance/quality control.

BSA places great importance on worker safety and the maintenance of a safe worksite.  Therefore, a safety incentive has been included as part of this procurement.  The safety incentive is based on the following factors; 1) Accident/Injury Rates; 2) Serious violation of OSHA requirements and 3) Responsiveness to less serious OSHA requirements.  

The estimated cost for construction of the NSLS-II Ring Building is approximately $180,000,000.00 to $205,000,000.00.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS
Plans and specifications may be obtained from BlueprintOnline. Costs associated with obtaining these documents will depend on the number of documents ordered. Detailed instructions for accessing plans and specifications at http://www.blueprintonline.com are contained in Enclosure 5 of attached RFP.

<ARCHDATE>03212009
<CONTACT>Vincent J Sanchez, Phone 703-875-6629, Email SanchezVJ@state.gov
<DESC>Effective February 1, 2009, the United States Department of State (DOS) will no longer be certifying anti-ram barriers under it's current Anti-ram barrier standard, STD-02.01 Revision A dated March 2003. Beginning February 1, 2009, DOS will evaluate only new anti-ram barriers tested under ASTM F2656-07 Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash Testing of Perimeter Barriers for the selection and approval for use at DOS facilities. The only barriers considered will be those with an ASTM F2656-07 rating of M30 P1, M40 P1, and M50 P1. Furthermore, DOS will only consider barriers in which the impact point has been chosen or agreed to by the DOS. As stated in ASTM F2656-07, failure to consult with DOS regarding the impact point may jeopardize the eligibility of the barrier to be installed at DOS facilities.

DOS will no longer issue anti-ram barrier certification letters for tests performed after February 28, 2009. Any tests successfully performed on or before January 31, 2009 will be considered eligible for the issuance of a DOS certification letter. Upon issuance of the last certification letter, DOS will publish the last List of DOS Certified Anti-Ram barriers sometime in early 2009. 

DOS is currently transitioning to an internal approved barrier list. This list will be a subset of all current and future barriers that meet the ASTM F2656-07 and/or STD-02.01 Revision A dated March 2003 test criteria. Barriers placed on this new list will be selected specifically for DOS facilities based on newly developed in-house critieria. Barriers will be added and removed from this new internal approved list as facility needs warrant. 

DOS wishes to thank the testing facilities, barrier manufacturers, and members of ASTM in their successful efforts in transitioning the DOS anti-ram test procedure into a self-regulated International Standard.

This proximity should allow NIDA IRP research staff to walk with the research participant to/from the overnight/inpatient facility to the NIDA IRP research facility and afford maximal participant safety and monitoring.
It is optimal that the facility allows NIDA IRP contractual research staff to perform limited study interventions or measures to study participants while housed on the in-patient facility.

The Contractors shall be able to demonstrate considerable experience in maintaining a residential research unit.  Infrastructure and physical plant must be suitable to deliver services in a manner that ensures both comfort and safety of the research participant.  Professional staff must have the necessary protocols.  Training for physicians and other care providers must be appropriate to care for patients and research control volunteers in clinical protocols.
