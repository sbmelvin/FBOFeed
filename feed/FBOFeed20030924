The Offeror should have facilities suitable for development and maintenance of the mice strains required for this project, along with experience in breeding, rearing, maintaining and distributing animal colonies of similar magnitude and having similar health, genetic, and environmental requirements.  The Offeror should also have an awareness of problems and complications likely to be observed in the conduct of this project and methods to address them, particularly, the knowledge of the importance of maintenance of the high standard of health and genetic purity.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  It will be available on this website, as well as at the following website: http://ocm.od.nih.gov/drc/rfp.htm   on or about 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for fall protection systems to be installed on future roofing and/or fall protection projects. NASA/JSC intends to include a specific make and model of fall protection system in all aforementioned projects. This fall protection system will consist of stanchions, cabling, snap-on hookups, and pertinent hardware that meet the requirements of ANSI Z359.1-1992. Body harnesses and lanyards are not within the scope of this requirement. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Latchways Fall Arrest Systems pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR Part 6.3, “Other than Full and Open Competition.” For previous roofing contracts, we relied on the prime contractors to make the decision on which fall protection system to install. All contractors, independently, installed the Latchways “ManSafe” System. Due to compatibility, reliability, and safety concerns NASA/JSC has elected to purchase Latchways “ManSafe” System.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 9, 2003. Organizations should keep their capabilities and qualifications to a maximum of 15 pages in length. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB, Tennessee, provides test and evaluation services to defense contractors, as well as other  commercial customers who cannot reasonably obtain such testing in the private  sector.  AEDC is part of the national Major Range and Test Facility Base  (MRTFB), a broad base of test and evaluation activities which support  Department of Defense (DoD) missions, but are also available to other users  having a valid requirement for such capabilities. This notice is provided in  compliance with DoD policy to ensure MRTFB activities do not compete with  private industry for non-DoD test and evaluation support. DESCRIPTION: The  purpose of this synopsis is to provide public notice of the non-DoD test  support AEDC anticipates providing to commercial customers in Fiscal Year 2004  and to invite private sector expressions of capability to perform such test and  evaluation services.

This training program is intended for transportation planning, programming and project development staff who are involved with the statewide transportation planning process.  The target audience includes new planners, urban planners, FHWA/FTA field staff, DOT staff working with statewide planning, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Rural/Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs), Regional Development Commissions (RDCs), transit agencies and consultants.

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted. Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFPs will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by Wednesday, October 29, 2003.  RFPs will be mailed out shortly thereafter.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a sole source Request for Quotation (RFQ) to Acelo Solutions, Inc. pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.501 under the authority of the test program for commercial items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain Contractor-provided operational, functional, maintenance, and update support services for the Order Fulfillment and Accounting System (OFAS).  The technical support includes ongoing maintenance and continued rollout of the OFAS application that must be maintained and integrated into the OFAS.  OFAS provides NARA staff nationwide with a means to receive, process and track the fulfillment status of customer requests for copies of records, in addition to the traditional requirement to track and report the revenue generated by these requests.  The OFAS application was designed to replace the out-dated, much more limited Service Order System (SOS) application and to automate sales processing for regional activities.  Development of OFAS began in September 1998.  OFAS deployment at the Federal Records Centers was complete by December 1999, and it fully replaced the SOS application in May 2000.  During its latest full fiscal year of operation (FY 2002), OFAS handled more than 253,000 orders nationwide, including 21,000 custom NATF Form 72 orders; more than 62,000 fixed fee orders for the Office of Records Services-Washington, DC; and 195,000 Point of Sale transactions performed at the regional records facilities around the country, at the Federal Register, and at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library.  Additional Presidential Libraries are being added to OFAS as they request it.  OFAS is composed of several software applications that integrate with one another and link to a common database: Microsoft Great Plains eEnterprise,
Compass Technologies Retail Point of Sale (POS), Go Software PC-Charge, Scanner Utility, Web Order Entry System (WOENet), and
WorkFlow.  At the core of the OFAS application is Great Plains eEnterprise that accounts for the collection of revenues, and reports these revenues to General Services Administration's (GSA) core accounting system.  Because eEnterprise is the primary application used in the OFAS solution, its requirements dictate the hardware, operating systems and all other application software that comprise the overall OFAS solution.  eEnterprise is designed to run on Microsoft NT operating systems using a Microsoft SQL Server.  In Wide Area Network implementations, a Microsoft terminal server running the Citrix ICA protocol is the recommended solution from Microsoft Great Plains and is used by NARA.  The purchase order will be issued on or about November 26, 2003.  The purchase order will contain a base period of one year and four option periods of one year.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, but all responsible sources may submit an offer on or before COB October 9, 2003, which will be evaluated and considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Offerors responding to this notice must provide proof of providing successful support services for the cited software products.  This proof must include, but is not limited to, knowledge and experience with Microsoft Great Plains accounting software; Compass Technologies Point of Sale software; Microsoft eCommerce; Microsoft Dexterity programming language; Microsoft Visual Basic; and Microsoft Visual Basic Script.  Proof must also include the ability to provide an experienced Certified Public Accountant (CPA) trained in these core OFAS software packages, functional accounting principles, and the customizations developed and integrated into the design.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  No telephone or fax RFQ request will be accepted. *****

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Quotations (RFQ) Number Q3C5AAC0033 in support of the HUD Headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R).  This procurement is for a fixed-price contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). 

The objective of this project is to re-benchmark the Fair Market Rents (FMRs) and reengineer the FMR process to implement the American Community Survey (ACS). It will also involve re-defining FMR areas based on CBSAs.  

The purpose of this request is to acquire expertise on re-benchmarking FMRs, re-engineering the FMR process to incorporate ACS data and to implement the geographic area definitions. FMRs are re-benchmarked every 10 years as decennial census data become available. The 2000 Decennial census rent tabulations will become available in September of 2003. Additionally, with the advent of the American Community survey, the decennial re-benchmarking process will be superceded by the availability of continual data streaming from the ACS. The entire re-benchmarking process must be re-engineered to accommodate these new ACS data. The purpose of this project is to re-benchmark the FMRs and reengineer the FMR process to implement the ACS. It will also involve re-defining FMR areas based on Core Based Statistical Area (CBSAs) and recalculating all rents and rent adjustment factors based on these new geographies. 

Some specific objectives are: 
Review Census 2000 data rents and utilities for quality.
Generate adjustment factors: quality adjustments, assisted housing, state minimum rents, bedroom size factors
Determine the role of ACS in calculating FMR details such as quality adjustments, state minimums, bedroom ratios and recent mover bonuses.
Determine the role of ACS in calculating baseline FMR's and FMR updates.
Determine how calculation of the Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs) can or should be affected by the ACS.
Thoroughly research, analyze and help implement CBSA definitions in FMR production.

 The proposed Purchase Order is for the study to be completed within one year.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees average for the last three years (See Numbered Note 1). Solicitation package will be available on or about August 6, 2003. Quotations will be due on or about August 26, 2003.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for  the evaluation of savings (such as electricity) due to application of Adsil to air conditioners for Sustainable Environment for Quality of Life (SEQL) project in the North Carolina/South Carlina region surrounding Charlotte, NC.  A new coating, Adsil, is available which when applied to evaporators, condensers, and fans of an air conditioner unit can bring efficiency of that unit virtually back to that of a new unit.   This project is a pilot to evaluate the possible energy-related benefits of coating many  air conditioning units in the SEQL area with Adsil.  It is anticipated that approximately 30 buildings' units will be treated by April 2004.  This purchase order will support EPA in (1) evaluating the change in energy usage after application of Adsil coating to air conditioning units, (2) provide  the electricity use reduction information in a format that the State air office and Regional office can use for determining benefits, and (3) calculate the cost and energy savings due to coating the air conditioning units and provide a tool with which to project similar savings for other buildings.  EPA anticipates the award of a best value fixed price purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures with full and open competition.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be available on our internet website http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd approximately October 9, 2003, and quotes will  be due approximately twenty (20) calendar days after the RFQ issuance date.

Tel: 703-875-4357 Fax: 703-875-4009 Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Razvan Purdila, Director, Investment Projects Management Division, Transelectrica S.A., Blvd. Gen. Gh. Magheru, 33, Bucharest-1, Romania, 010325, Phone: (40) 21 303 5616, Fax: (40) 21 303 5660.
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to develop a program for rebuilding and overhauling Transelectrica’s major power transmission substations. 

Transelectrica S.A. was established as the 100% state-owned national power grid company in 2001.  Its core business activities involve: (1) Providing power transmission services based on contractual arrangements with power generators; (2) Ensuring reliable power supplies throughout the country; (3) Dispatching power generation as required by consumer demand; and (4) Acting as the “Commercial Operator” for the national power market.  Since its establishment, Transelectrica has become a profit making entity that is able to finance capital projects on the strength of its own balance sheet.  The firm has recently secured loans for upgrading and modernizing the power grid from the EBRD, World Bank, and commercial lenders. 

Economic stagnation in Romania during the 1990’s resulted in reduced demand for electricity.  That in turn led to inadequate investments and insufficient maintenance of the country’s transmission and distribution infrastructure.  Now that economic activity is accelerating, demand is increasing again.  This has put pressure on Transelectrica to upgrade its facilities and improve the quality of its services.  Transelectrica aims to take advantage of its strategic geographical location by becoming the hub of electricity transmission in Southeastern Europe.  Under Transelectrica’s management the Romanian power grid will operate an interconnected part of the Western European grid or the Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) system, while maintaining transboundry electricity connections with the regional markets to the east and south.

One of Transelectrica’s major initiatives is to rehabilitate and modernize its 77 substations to provide for safe and reliable operations. Transelectrica plans to invest 32 million euros in 2003 for its substation rehabilitation initiative, and 111.8 million euros in 2004.  This will significantly improve the quality of the power transmission service and facilitate the smooth functioning of the wholesale electricity market. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $247,450 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, October 31, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Contract F33601-03-C-0051 has been awarded, as of 23 Sep 2003, to  Frebco, Inc., 3400 Kettering Blvd, Dayton, Ohio 45439.  The value of the  contract award is $794,900, for Contract Line Item Number 0001. UPDATE:  The award information has been posted to the site. UPDATE:  The purpose of this update is to give a historical perspective for how  we contract for efforts associated with the steam lines, that are being  utilized for 6 months out of the year.  After the contractors accomplish all  efforts that can be accomplished prior to actually interrupting the steam  lines, the contractor will often be put into dormancy for a specified period of  time.  The contract will be extended for that amount of time, beyond the  original schedule.  All work would need to be completed prior to the start up  of the steam lines on 01 Oct of the following year. UPDATE:  This update is in response to an RFI #2 that was submitted.  The RFI  was as follows:  "Clarify the extent of work that can be accomplished before  the 01 May 04 shutdown of the heating plant."  The clarification is as  follows:  During the shutdown of work on the steam lines, from 01 Oct 03  through 30 Apr 04, the contractor shall determine the extent of work that he  can accomplish during and after the shutdown.  No other changes are hereby  incorporated. UPDATE:  This update is to incorporate Addendum Number 2 to the  specifications.  The Specification is hereby being corrected for the maximum  permissible heat loss.  See Addendum Number 2 for more information. UPDATE:  This update is to add the clause entitled Small Business Program  Representations, FAR 52.219-1, to Section K of the solicitation.  Subparagraphs  (a) and (b) are filled in with a NAICS code of 234910 and a size standard of  $28.5M, respectively.  No other changes are hereby incorporated. UPDATTE:  This update is to post the time and place for a site visit.  This  visit will include IFBs 03B0003 and 03B0004, as they are similar in effort.   Government transportation will be provided from Gate 1C, building 260, Wright  Patterson AFB, on Wednesday 20 August 2003, at 1000.

Project Number 960703: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10834 (Base) Project Number 960704: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10835 (Option I) Project Number 960705: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10836 (Option II) Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0050. The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the replacement of the fan coil units,  heating/cooling water system, windows, and roof in Facilities 10834, 10835, and  10836.  The scope will also include associated architectural, mechanical,  plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as shown on the project drawings  and described in the specifications.  The estimated price range is  between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $12M.   This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, *Required Central Contractor  Registration.: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: This project involves  the Visitor Quarters (VQ), which houses military and  civilian personnel of all levels, including VIPs on  Temporary Duty at WPAFB for numerous official Air Force  activities.  This project is in an extremely high  visibility area, due to the number of visiting individuals  housed at any one time, and will receive an unusually high  level of scrutiny.  This project will be subject to a very  tight construction schedule.  The project is in phases, and  involves work in each room.  This work will require close  coordination between disciplines, and close supervision by  the contractor in order to minimize the number of  unavailable rooms at any one time.  The work must be  accomplished so that the remaining occupied units will not  be impacted, nor the personnel housed in them  inconvenienced.  The requirement to supervise and  coordinate the work in all of the rooms contained in the  VQ will present the contractor with a difficult  construction management challenge.  Failure to supervise  and coordinate the different trades required to provide a  quality and timely product will not be acceptable.   Performance is critical to minimize disruption to WPAFB  activities.  The liquidated damages associated with not  meeting the contractual period of performance will be high  due to the cost of housing Air Force personnel off base if  the rooms are not available on schedule. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 14 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W.  Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. (5) A registration page will be attached to the website.  You are not required  to register.  Howeverm when you register you will receive notice of any  amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total proposed  amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.  If an option is exercised after award,  contractors shall be responsible for securing the additional bonding equal to  the amount of the option. (7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing date  specified in the solicitation.  There will not be a public bid opening. (8) Contractors that are Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment are  excluded from receiving contracts.  Agencies also shall not consent to  subcontract with such contractors.  Proposals prepared by Debarred, Suspended,  or otherwise ineligible contractors are at the risk and expense of the  contractor.

Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcoal will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.  Task orders would be competed among the three to five firms that were awarded an IDIQ, with each task order awarded based on best value or lowest price technically acceptable proposal.  The seed project for this solicitation is for the Repairs to Visiting Quarters, Building 438, Naval Air Facility Key West, FL.

The work will be at the following primary locations:  Naval Air Station Pensacola and outlying airfields; Corry Station; Naval Surface Warfare Center Coastal Systems Station Panama City; Naval Air Station Whiting Field, and outlying airfields in the Panhandle of North West Florida.    Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, cost or price or other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million. Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders would be responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of 3 to 7 proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), Management Approach and Small Business subcontracting effort.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including (new construction and renovation) but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements civil construction grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful 3 to 7 Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each see project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the see projects if it is in the Government's best interest. The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the best overall proposal(s) for all seed projects after those offerors who have been awarded a seed project(s) have been removed from further competition.   A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s) where a seed project is not awarded.  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.  Future task orders would be competed among the firms that were awarded an IDIQ contract, with each task order awarded based on best value or lowest price technically acceptable proposal.  The seed project(s) for this solicitation are unconfirmed at this time.  Due to funding constraints, authorization to advertise see project(s) is not expected until after the Phase I portion of this solicitation is completed.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)

1.0 Program Objective:
The objective of Project 3F9 is to assign a manufacturer to design, manufacture, install, test, perform maintenance training and studio lighting techniques training on nine complete turnkey studio lighting systems and fixtures at the Air Force Broadcasting Service's television stations overseas.  These broadcast locations support the Bases and communities with television news and information daily. 

2.0 Contract Objectives.
To allow manufacturers in the broadcast industry the flexibility to specifically define their solution to the requirement, perform installation of the items at each Government owned facility, and conduct proof of performance testing and follow-on instruction in managing the installed system, as well as instruction in lighting principles.   

2.1 Design, Removal, Installation and Test:
The design, delivery, removal of old light system and installation of complete, turnkey computer controlled studio lighting systems used to illuminate a minimum of one set and a maximum of three sets at each location listed in the RFP. Offerors shall include in their proposal the costs to perform an initial site survey to each of the Air Force Broadcasting Service’s locations as listed, to provide accurate development of Bill of Materials (BOM) to meet the requirements of the RFP.  The effective proposal will follow the Joint Travel Regulation (JFTR)/Per Diem for all travel; have travel costs limited to coach class air travel and government lodging per diem rates. Historical travel data shows these costs to be approximately $10k per theater of operation (Europe/Pacific).  The resulting BOM from these visits shall use the same brand of lighting equipment at all locations and be scalable to provide TV studio lighting systems to support nine Air Force owned broadcasting outlets of various size and scope and shall include personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items necessary to install complete lighting systems.  Contractor will be responsible for all meals for the installation team.  Offerors will ship lighting equipment to domestic location; government will supply transportation to overseas location in coordination with the Contractor’s schedule.  Performance of initial installation will occur at the Air Force Broadcasting Service location at Yokota Air Base, Fussa Shi, in Tokyo Japan.  Follow-on installations throughout the remaining locations are to occur simultaneously between the Japan and European areas of operation. Testing shall be performed as needed in each location to aid in the performance process and to document that the lighting systems meet performance requirements specified in the SOW.  
The Air Force will provide the electrical power, physical grid structure (pipe or rail) and disposal of old lighting equipment removed by contractor.

2.2 Configuration Management:
This is based upon establishment of a product baseline using previously manufactured equipment solutions of a similar scope with a demonstrated capability to satisfy the user's performance requirement. Contractor shall provide a comparative description of how these proposed solutions will adequately meet the specified requirement. Contractor shall clearly describe the capabilities of their proposal, as well as the scalability required to meet expanded studio usage in the future. As these systems are computer controlled, contractor shall define the mechanisms or processes wherein the government will maintain currency of controlling or communications software or hardware as required to sustain the performance of these lighting systems for a period of not less than ten years.  


2.3 Quality Control:
Development and presentation of installation drawings, performance standards, and test procedures to be used to verify the lighting control unit, communications software, control software, dimmer packs, and fixtures are produced and installed in accordance with supporting engineering data. Contractor shall address in their SOW all warranty provisions offered regarding the equipment or software deliverable under their proposal.

2.4 Training: 
The contractor shall provide training for studio lighting systems installed under this project SOW using contractor-owned/provided learning materials and methodologies to produce a graduate that satisfies the Air Force Broadcasting Service’s mission and learning objectives. 
The mission of the Air Force Broadcasting Service is to provide quality television production products in order to enhance each Commander’s Internal Information program. 
The objective of the course is to familiarize the student with various types of common lighting and related studio lighting techniques or standards. Guidance is provided on the efficient operation of contractor installed lighting systems. The course presents an approach to studio lighting that enables participants to recognize imagery problems such as those created by point of operation, poor balance of lighting, misplaced fixtures in such a manner as to achieve abatement. The course also includes an introduction to studio lighting. Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to: 
·	identify common imagery problems or inadequacies associated with poor lighting,  
·	identify root causes for lighting problems, 
·	select the lighting setup that applies to the existing sets in the studio, 
·	present options to achieve abatement of the imagery problem or inadequacy. 
Contractor personnel assigned to teach this course shall have expertise in the subject area and instructional experience. The personnel shall be knowledgeable of all initial presentation and remediation procedures, training aids, devices and equipment associated with the course and shall be evaluated by both the contractor and government. Contractor instructors will be evaluated by Government subject matter experts and by student critiques. 
Contractor is to provide all training materials used in the course.  There is no predetermined list of training materials, e.g. handouts, audiovisual aids, references, manuals, video tapes etc., to be used in the course; however, any training materials that are used shall be made available to the government to sustain lighting proficiency.


2.5 Logistics:
As a minimum, the contractor shall address the following areas regarding the logistics of this project:   Timeline for performing site surveys, Development and provisioning of all equipment and data necessary to support the studio lighting systems; Delivery and installation consistent with the performance requirements. Physical compatibility with existing government grid systems is fundamental. Electrical compatibility with supply voltages is also a critical factor.  

3.0 Method of Award

Our intent is to award the contract based upon best value to the government. Of the factors listed, proven performance, availability of regional geographic technical support and use of current lighting industry technology together weigh more than cost alone. Cost will not be the sole determining factor in the selection process.


3.1 Price Proposal Evaluation
Offerors’ price proposals will be evaluated to determine price realism and reasonableness.  Prices which are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable and may receive no further consideration.

3.2 Technical Approach

Evaluation of proposals will be based upon the following factors:
1)	proven historical performance of the offeror
2)	prior installations of similar or larger scope
3)	use of current studio lighting control technology
4)	warranty support- scope and depth 
5)	availability of regional geographic support for lighting instruments, control devices or components of the system offered
6)	overall project cost

3.3 Evaluation of Key Personnel
As a minimum, each proposed contractor will submit company qualifications for design, installation, maintenance training and studio lighting techniques training.

3.3.1 Technical Qualifications of key personnel
List personnel and technical qualifications of all key personnel

7.0 Site Information
General Information:
Air Force Broadcasting detachments operate in four locations in Japan, two in Germany, one in Italy, one in Turkey, and one in the Azores (Portugal). For ease of consolidating geographic requirements, they are listed here in two categories: Pacific and European locations. 
Most of the locations listed are prepared to provide 110vac 50/60 Hz. Some are only wired for 220vac 50Hz operation. Lighting solutions defined in the contractor’s SOW  (control computers, dimmer equipment, lighting instruments) and any ancillary equipment defined shall address operation using both electrical supply voltages.  
Some of the stations operate in warm climates, where air conditioning systems are regularly tasked to their limits. For this reason, we prefer the use of fluorescent based lighting, or mixed lighting with minimal usage of incandescent fixtures to provide a balanced lighting environment with minimal heat conditions.
Each of the sites is described in detail in the following pages.

<DESC>PURPOSE.......

BWXT Y-12, L.L.C.

The value of the site work construction is estimated to be in the range of $4-8 million dollars.  Award of any site work is contingent upon funding of this project, and funding is not currently available.  It is the intent of the Company to secure a Small Business construction subcontractor capable of performing the required construction activities for this project. 

This expression of interest (EOI) does not constitute an invitation for sealed bids or a request for proposal.  This request is for the purpose of identifying prospective and qualified small business firms.  Responses received will be used for planning purposes and determining potential candidates for subsequent procurement actions, if any. It is the Company’s intent to make this procurement a Small Business Set-Aside. If you do not respond affirmatively to all participation criteria contained in the expression of interest, you will not be eligible for subsequent procurement actions. After evaluating responses to this EOI, the Company will determine if a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are interested to allow for a competitive Small Business Set-Aside procurement. If so, the Company will issue a Request for Qualifications to the qualified small businesses that responded to this EOI. If it is determined that a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are not available, the Company will issue a Request for Qualifications to small and big businesses.

Technical documents for this project will contain Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) and Official Use Only (OUO) information which requires special information security preparations on the part of the short listed contractors prior to receiving the RFP. All subcontractor personnel working on this project must be United States citizens.........

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT & SCOPE OF WORK............... 
  

The Site Work required to support Building 9720-82 (footprint is approximately 450 feet by 300 feet) encompasses approximately 3 acres with an overall construction site of approximately 7 acres. The work location is at the Y-12 National Security Complex and physical access to the site will be from Tennessee State Route 95 and Bear Creek Road West. The work location does not require Q-Cleared workers, but all construction personnel must be United States citizens with DOE issued identification badges and vehicle passes. Construction work at the Y-12 National Security Complex requires the successful contractor to become signatory to the Construction Labor Agreement (CLA) with the Knoxville Building and Construction Trades Council (KBCTC). 

Construction activities for this new non-reactor nuclear facility must be in accordance with the Price-Anderson Amendments Act 10 CFR Part 830, Nuclear Safety Management; Subpart A, Quality Assurance Requirements.

Work scope consists of providing all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, material and services to perform the following:

- Construction of temporary construction haul and access roads, including paving(as required) maintenance thereof, temporary site entrances and barriers

- Quality Control/Quality Assurance--Requirements will be in accordance with 10 CFR Part 830.122 “Quality Assurance Criteria” and DOE 414.1A “Quality Assurance”............

PROCUREMENT PROCESS................

The Company intends to award an evaluated competitive firm-fixed price subcontract to the qualified successful Small Business offeror that best meets the project’s goals and objectives.  Selection will be based on best-value using a three-phased approach of an Expression of Interest (EOI), Request for Qualifications (RFQ), and Request for Proposals (RFP). 

Phases 1, Expression of Interest, will determine if a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are interested. If there is adequate interest in small business community to proceed to Phase 2, then the strategy remains a Small Business Set Aside. Should there be insufficient small businesses expressing interest to provide adequate competition in the bid process, then the acquisition strategy will revert to full and open competition and include both large and small businesses that expressed interest. It should be noted that the threshold for the number of companies demonstrating an interest must be significantly greater than the number needed to complete the proposal process. 

Phase 2, Request for Qualifications, will request that firms respond to evaluation factors regarding Past Performance & Experience, Technical Capabilities, and Organization & Personnel Qualifications. The down-selection process to a few firms is necessary due to the information security requirements. The design documents will contain UNCI and OUO information and require preparations on the part of the short listed firms and the Company prior to issuance of the RFP. From the responses received, the Company will evaluate and score the Statements of Qualification against the RFQ evaluation criteria to down-select to the shortlist to receive the Request for Proposals. No pricing is to be included in Phase 2. 

Offerors selected to receive the RFP must comply with the Company information security requirements prior to receiving the design documents. All construction offeror personnel that will be handling, viewing or using Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) or Official Use Only (OUO) documentation must complete BWXT Y-12 provided training prior to receiving the RFP package. 

Phase 3, Request for Proposals, will request that firms respond to technical evaluation factors such as, but not limited to, Project Management Plan & Business Management, Structure & Control, and Socioeconomic and Affirmative Action Plans and provide Pricing. A pre-bid meeting is planned in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The basis for award will be the firm offering the best overall value, considering price, the technical RFP submittals, and the Statement of Qualifications (SOQs) evaluated under the Request for Qualification. Subcontract award is anticipated in January 2004, but will ultimately depend on the availability of funding..................

<SUBJECT>A--MOBILE AD HOC NETWORK AND TACTICAL DATA LINK SIMULATION CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION BY  SINGLE INTEGRATED AIR PICTURE SYSTEM ENGINEERING  TASK FORCE(SIAP SE TF)
<SOLNBR>N0002403R5147
<CONTACT>Maj David Borowsky (703) 602-6441 david.borowsky@siap.pentagon.mil;  LCDR Kristin Acquavella (202) 781-4175  acquavellak@navsea.navy.mil.
<DESC>1. OVERVIEW: The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineering Task Force (SIAP SE TF) has the mission of resolving critical operational shortfalls in Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense (JTAMD) and related capabilities.  The Task Force analyzes current, and planned and programmed Joint Tactical Battle Management and Command and Control (BMC2) capability to identify policy and acquisition actions necessary to achieve the Integrated Architecture capable of providing a SIAP.   In support of this effort, the SIAP SE TF is collecting information on applicable distributed modeling and simulation (M&S) capability that can provide representations of Joint Tactical BMC2 system components and, to stimulate them, simulations of the physical environment in which they operate.  The components necessary for this analysis include existing communication systems (e.g., Link 16, Link 11), na vigation and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems in various warfighting units, radar systems, other sensors and host mission computers used to generate and process measurements and observations. These components should support a composable M&S architecture, so specific requirements for these simulations fall into the categories of (1) mobile ad hoc network and Tactical Data Link communication services and effects, (2) sensors, (3) radiation propagation, (4) observables, (5) environmental effects, (6) navigation systems, (7) IFF systems (including Mode 5 and Mode S), (8) host mission computer programs (applications), (9) weapons and (10) scenario driver. The SIAP SE TF has adopted the Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) Technical Framework as its primary means for performing the required analyses.  JDEP is a DoD program that is focused on providing common, reusa ble sets of simulation components that adhere to commercial and DoD standards for interoperability, particularly the High Level Architecture (HLA).  JDEP was established to help foster reuse of such components to support Joint Tactical BMC2 interoperability testing and acquisition analyses across DoD.  Because of its particular focus on addressing system-of-system analysis using distributed simulation, JDEP is the ideal vehicle for supporting SIAP analyses. The SIAP SE TF expects to use the component simulations in a JDEP federation beginning early in calendar year 2004.   2.PURPOSE: This RFI seeks to identify the capabilities that currently exist to simulate mobile ad hoc network and Tactical Data Link communication services and effects, in order to analyze the impact of variations in (1) latency, (2) bandwidth, (3) message order, (4) application protocols, (5) membership,  (6) network services, (7) security services, (8) traffic patterns and (9) network utilization.  The simulations may include the following functionality, and should be able to represent at least one of the following systems/message standards (see Figure 1): a. JTIDS/MIDS and Link 16 (MIL-STD-6016), to include  i. Contention Access   ii. Time Slot Allocation/Reallocation  iii. Relative Navigation  iv. Enhanced Throughput  v. Net Entry  vi. Data Forwarding b. Link 11 (MIL-STD-3011) c. Link 22 d. Joint Range Extension (JRE) (MIL-STD-3011) e. Variable Message Format (VMF) f. Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), to include  i. Composite Tracking Network model  ii.  Data Distribution System (DDS) g. Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) h. Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) and mobile IPv6.  This is expected to be model of the operational services available through IP v6 and mobile IPv6 capable networks, not a model of an IPv6 network, to include:  i. Packet authentication headers for stronger security   ii. Establishment of multiple server environments to address load sharing and reliability (anycast and multicast services)  iii.  Dynamic routing to capitalize on best bandwidth  iv.  Quality of service assertions and prioritization of information flow  v.  Temporary store and forward for "connectivity buffering" to address short duration dropouts or network partitions  vi. "Post before process" availability of data from different stages of the formation and management of data:         - unassociated measurements (e.g., radar, IFF, passive)         - associated measurements         - tracks         - unit level decisions  vii. Routing to selectively channel a wide variety of information to specific units   viii. Reduction of deni al of service and other significant vulnerabilities through maintenance of authorized nodes and authentication headers in all communications.   ix. Multi-Level Security    x. Reliable delivery protocols and "edge" store and forward capabilities to provide reliable services for nodes with connectivity challenges (e.g., maneuvering aircraft)  xi. Ability to assess source/destination pairs served by multiple paths of varying performance (capacity and latency) to optimize system capacity, while meeting expressed latency/priority requirements. i. General:  i. Complies with the DoD High Level Architecture (HLA)/Run Time Infrastructure (RTI) 1.3NGv6 or IEEE-Std-1516 for distributed modeling and simulation.  ii. Supports both the conservative and optimistic time management strategies supported by the HLA Time Management services.  iii. Supports physical interfaces to tactical sy stems/equipment (e.g., X.25, Mil Std 1553)   iv. Allows internal data logging/recording for component and federate-level testing Figure 1: Communication Simulation/Computer Program Interaction Graphic is avaiable at http://www.nll.navsup.navy.mil Go to Product/Tools/Pubs Contract Support Library Doc Type NAVSEA DOCS DOC# SEA0006 Search 3.

<DESC>The CRADA meeting mentioned in this solicitation was held on August 12, 2003. The reason for this modification is to extend the time to be considered for a CRADA partnership from the listed time of 60 days to the new time of 120 days beyond the date of the CRADA meeting (December 12, 2003). The original notice follows:  The Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is actively seeking a licensee and/or CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) partner to collaborate on the development and commercialization of NOAA Science On a Sphere? (SOS). SOS presents global Earth science to the public in a new and exciting way by providing an engaging three-dimensional representation of our planet as if the viewer were looking at the Earth from outer space. The system uses a bank of computers coupled with strategically placed video projectors to display animated geophysical and atmospheric information onto the outside of a large, opaque sphere. The integrated display can be viewed by moving around the suspended sphere while listening to an audio narrative describing the images and the processes being observed on the sphere. An example of one simulation is a darkened room in a museum setting; the audience walks in to see the Earth seemingly floating in space and slowly rotating through day/night and night/day scenes. Additional simulations that can be displayed on SOS include, any kind of global satellite imagery, images of the Sun, moon and other planets, weather forecasts, near real time and past weather events, ocean currents, population growth over the centuries, and many, many more. Displayable simulations on SOS are limited only by the imagination. The concept for SOS originated entirely within NOAA and is intended to provide a dramatic visualization of complex Earth and planetary science information in an understandable form for the public. Possible public venues for SOS displays include museums, government facilities, nature discovery centers, secondary schools, universities, scientific conferences, corporate headquarters, airports and other major transportation centers. SOS can be used as a tool to help scientists better visualize and understand dynamic processes in the oceans and atmosphere. A demonstration of SOS will be given and a meeting will be held in Boulder, CO, at NOAA/FSL in August 2003 for those companies with interest in developing a CRADA with FSL for this technology. The date and time of this meeting will be published on the SOS website http://www.fsl.noaa.gov/sos/. Companies wishing to be considered for a CRADA partnership must respond no later than 60 days after this meeting with a letter of interest outlining their line of business, technical expertise and desire for pursuing this collaboration. Companies deemed appropriate candidates will then be provided with additional information on this opportunity. FSL is interested in working with a commercial collaborator, under the auspices of the Federal Technology Transfer Act, 15 USC 3710a, to transfer this technology to the private sector. FSL has filed a patent application for SOS. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis. The private company or organization forming this partnership with FSL would assist in the research and development of the product and would be responsible for commercializing, marketing, and maintaining the SOS displays that would be implemented. Prior to licensee selection, companies considering entering into negotiations for a license or CRADA will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of this technology. *** No solicitation is available. No procurement action will result from this notice. The government will not reimburse respondent costs for replying to this notice. *** The point of contact for technical inquiries regarding this Request for Information should be addressed to William B. Bendel, Chief, International Division, (303) 497-6708 or William.B.Bendel@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- Robins AFB Varsity Basketball Sponsorship Opportunity
<DESC>The Robins AFB Fitness Center is currently hosting their Men & Women’s Varsity Basketball season.  Both Varsity teams did really well last year.  The men won the AFMC championship out of nine other teams from across the USA and the women took second place at the AFMC Women’s Basketball Championship out of seven other bases across the nation.  Both events had approximately 1,000 people in attendance, and that was only at the championships.  For this years basketball season we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing cash to help offset entry fees, warm-up tops, and cost of uniforms as well as those who can provide in-kind for practice jerseys, uniforms, water bottles, towels, drinks, wrist bands, etc.

If so, we can offer you possible logo and/or name recognition in promotional event materials, our Services Edge magazine (15,000 published per month), our Services website, the Rev-Up (20,000 published per week) and even on an event thank you sign.

<SUBJECT>R -- Tops In Blue Sponsorship Opportunity
<DESC>On November 16, 2003 Robins Air Force Base will once again be hosting Tops In Blue at the Warner Robins Civic Center.  The Tops In Blue team will perform before an audience of more than 1,400 people.  The show is free of charge and open to the general public.  The audience will primarily consist of active duty military and their family members.
Tops In Blue is composed of 36 of the most talented active duty US Air Force vocalists, musicians, and dancers worldwide.  Tops In Blue is one of the oldest and most widely traveled entertainment groups of its kind.  The 2003 tour will take Tops In Blue throughout the United States and to more than 27 countries, with a total of over 140 performances over a 9-month period.  The Tops In Blue team puts in a lot of hard work for each show, not only during, but before each and every show they are responsible for setting up over 40,000 pounds of staging, audio, lighting, and special effects equipment required for each performance. 
This year is going to be very special for us here in Warner Robins as well as the Tops In Blue performers themselves, as this year marks the 50th Anniversary for Tops In Blue.  For this exciting production we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing cash and in-kind for finger foods, refreshments, a plaque to award to the performers and other expenses we encounter by hosting Tops In Blue.  We want to ensure the members receive the sort of trademark welcome that Middle Georgia is famous for giving guests to our community.  
Would your company like to be a part of the Tops In Blue performance again this year?  If so, we can offer you possible logo and/or name recognition in promotional event materials, our Services Edge magazine (15,000 published per month), our Services website, the Rev-Up (20,000 published per week) and even on an event thank you sign.
