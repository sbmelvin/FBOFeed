The VA anticipates issuing an open and continuous solicitation for this requirement. The VA will accept proposals throughout the current year until 12/28/2019. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov. Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies are available. The solicitation will provide instructions to contractors about the proposal submission process. Prospective Offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments. Proposals will be evaluated for award on a periodic basis. 

In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management, prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database under the applicable NAICS Code. Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov. To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in SAM.

This requirement will be solicited on a competitive basis. There is an anticipation of multiple awards from this solicitation, which will be made commensurate with the needs of Fayetteville VA Medical Center. All responsible sources may submit proposals. The VA will consider for evaluation only proposals from sources found to be responsive and responsible. 

The VA will only consider proposals from contractors who are Community Nursing Home facilities and licensed by the State of North Carolina and who are Medicaid qualified.

Patient placements in contract nursing home facilities are based on availability of facilities in a geographical location and the desires of the veterans and their respective families. Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract vehicle.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><strong>-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------</strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems.

ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive.

<CONTACT>Ms Vivian Alexander, MMESO North Clinical Analyst, Phone (571) 231-5451, Email vivian.r.alexander.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Bleach. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1807-70_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Bleach are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Bleach products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MN-1807-70_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Bleach. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 16 Feb 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MN-1807- 70_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Bleach, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Bleach.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disinfecting Surface Wipes with Bleach. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $158,215 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MN-1807-70_Disinfecting_Surface_Wipes_with_Bleach who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />1. DISINFECTING SURFACE WIPES, BLEACH, INTERMEDIATE LEVEL, 3-5 MINUTE CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE (C. DIFF) KILL TIME, 40-160 WIPES PER CANISTER / 1,388,745 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary. <br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO North Team Leader, Ms. Vivian Alexander, 571-231-5451, vivian.r.alexander.ctr@mail.mil.

52.209-5 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law(Deviation) (March 2012) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Procurement Analyst is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Program Office, reports to the OTI Program Office Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. The Program Office, as part of OTI's Program, Learning, and Innovation (PLI) Division, provides the office with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level procurement, policy, budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p>Key functions of the Program Office are to: manage core procurement mechanisms that support country programs; provide management and oversight for budgeting decisions and allocation of resources; set standards and provide guidance to country programs on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation; and facilitate the flow of information regarding OTI programs with internal and external audiences. The Program Office is responsible for OTI outreach with counterparts within USAID as well as with other parts of the U.S. Federal Government, Capitol Hill, donors, and other interested partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Senior Procurement Analyst will also provide advice and assistance to program managers, technical and financial specialists, co-workers, and/or others, on contract procurement policies, problems, or issues. The incumbent will support OTI country program staff through advice, guidance, and assistance on new and ongoing contractual and financial issues to ensure effective implementation of political transition programming overseas.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance.

The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>
