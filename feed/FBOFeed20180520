<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO 2) intends to award a sole source contract to Cannon Design, 360 Madison Avenue 11th Floor, New York City, New York 10017 under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253-c-1, as implemented in FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. 

Cannon Design is to modify and update the completed designs from a major Office of Construction & Facilities Management (CFM) Project for a new non-recurring maintenance project at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System Manhattan Campus and to furnish all necessary labor to provide construction period services (CPS). 

Period of Performance: The period of performance is 180 calendar days from award notice.

This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; interested parties may express their interest by providing a capabilities statement no later than Monday, 04 June 2018 at 11:00 AM EST. The capabilities statement must provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate the capability of the party to provide the required services.   A determination not to compete this proposed requirement upon receipt of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered.  After 04 June 2018, at 2:00 PM EST, if no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, Department of Veterans Affairs shall negotiate solely with Cannon Design.

Cannon Design will update the previously prepared designs and provide Construction Period Services for this non-recurring maintenance project. Cannon Design has unique capabilities to provide the Government s requirement within a timely and practical manner.  The Government believes that it would be highly unusual for another design professional to take on the aforementioned responsibilities, which are generally incidental to an overall agreement for preparation of plans and specification.   

In the scope of work, A/E professional services are required to include the executive summary reports, contract drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and construction period services for the VA NYHHCS at 423 East 23rd Street, New York, NY for the following items, but not limited to:

All rooms will be converted into single patient rooms to meet the VA s guidelines to provide patient privacy.  Meet with clinical staff to determine the needs of the different units and functions.  Gut renovation will require some of the following: expand step down unit to, provide separate nurse s station satellite pixus type with open floor view of all rooms if possible, all rooms separated by glass partitions with curtains for privacy, the rest of the wing will be renovated for patient use, provide an ante room for isolation rooms, Med room, more storage, main nurse s station, new lights, ceiling, floors, doors and hardware, paint, hand rails, cove base, bedside computers, TV s, nurse call system, MEP, phasing plans (including swing space), commissioning, architectural plans with furniture, fixture and equipment plans and layouts,  etc. Provide services of CIH (if applicable) for asbestos abatement documents, sampling, air monitoring, drawings, A/E must meet and survey the nurses to meet their needs and concerns.

The point of contact for this action is Ms. Mitchelle Labady, Contract Specialist at Mitchelle.Labady@va.gov.
