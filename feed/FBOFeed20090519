<DESC><p>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2(b)(1). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL. The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Florida State University (FSU). The purpose of the requirement is to determine optimal parameter settings for the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) and the optimal usage of its inline tracer capability for transport and dispersion modeling. The WRF model was developed by various agencies and universities (e.g., the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Penn State University and is considered the United States meteorological community mesoscale model. This research and development will consist of sensitivity studies of both WRF with its tracer capability, and WRF using other transport and dispersion models for comparison. The anticipated period of performance is 24 months from date of award. FSU is the only source known to be capable of fulfilling the government's requirement. FSU has unique experience in long range transport issues, having participated in seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) airborne field projects involving the global transport of air pollutants. Locations of those field projects include numerous regions within both hemispheres. This vast experience in performing and analyzing numerical model simulations over various regions of the world is critical to accomplishment of this requirement. This research will answer questions that are very similar to those encountered during the NASA research. FSU prepared various T&amp;D products for each project using a variety of meteorological model output ranging from global models down to the locally run Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5). By viewing the trajectories and comparing them with airborne in situ data, FSU has obtained vast experience in assessing the quality of trajectories and other T&amp;D parameters. Other research projects have given FSU extensive experience in sensitivity studies of additional mesoscale models (e.g., the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) and their applicability to transport and dispersion analyses. FSU has extensive experience with both mesoscale and transport and dispersion models. Finally, the FSU personnel can consult (at no cost) with other inhouse meteorological faculty who also are experts in running the WRF model. The solicitation for this requirement will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP). It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712, with a size standard of 500. Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil). It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling DUN &amp; Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505). This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to negotiate with the Jackson Laboratory  a five year, sole source contract to continue maintenance of the Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders currently held at the Jackson Laboratories. Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Jackson Laboratory has been providing this vital resource to NIH and other researchers for more than 22 years. The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance over this period of time and is the only source that can provide the mouse models under the current demands for this resource. They are the only facility currently with the capacity to produce required partially trisomic and monosomic mice in adequate quantities and with the necessary quality control standards (with regard to genetic uniformity and pathogen-free environment) suitable for the research community at large.  A new contractor would have to develop breeding, maintenance, and cryopreservation techniques unique to the type of mice in this resource, specifically, strains with chromosome aberrations that are extremely difficult to breed in large quantities.  One would have to acknowledge and plan for the time needed to learn procedures involved in breeding, maintenance, and cryopreservation of these strains. There would be little room for developing the unique skills associated with cryopreservation of the Robertsonian (Rb) and partially trisomic embryos that could result in a significant loss of the frozen stocks in the resource.  Researchers rely on the resource to obtain segmental trisomy and Rb mice primarily for studies related to Down syndrome. Investigators require a foundation colony from which different stocks are derived so genetic drift does not occur among different colonies.  If another contractor were to be awarded the proposed contract it would take approximately one year for them to transfer and process the mice, thereby disrupting the distribution of the mice to researchers and potentially impacting their research. If the mice were to survive the transfer it is not known if another contractor could consistently duplicate the characteristics of the mouse models currently maintained at the Jackson Laboratory. This would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the governments requirements. The duplication of costs resulting from the transfer is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Background:
The mission of the NICHD is to ensure that every person is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability, and to ensure the health, productivity, independence and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.  The Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine (CDBPM) serves as a major National Institutes of Health (NIH) source of support for research in maternal, fetal, and infant health, and disorders of human development.  CDBPM-supported scientists are advancing fundamental clinical knowledge about maternal health and problems of child development.  The Center and its programs are helping to maximize human development, prevent diseases and disorders and improve diagnoses, therapy, and clinical care.  The major goals of the Center are to promote the health of mothers, their children and families.  The Intellectual and Developmental (IDD) Branch within CDBPM supports biomedical, behavioral, and biobehavioral research and training aimed at understanding, preventing, and ameliorating IDD and related conditions. Research supported by the Branch includes studies of the etiology, pathophysiology, screening, prevention, treatment and epidemiology of conditions associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Many of the grants supported by the IDD Branch utilize animal models of various IDD conditions to advance that research.  

The creation of mouse models relevant to Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) began in the 1970s with the creation by Alfred Gropp in Germany of trisomy for all 19 mouse chromosome and their pathologic characterization.  Subsequently, the demonstration of genetic synteny between a segment of Mmu16 and human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) led to the use of the trisomy 16 mouse (Ts16) as a model for studies relevant to DS.  With the subsequent genetic dissection of both mouse and human genomes, other genes present on Hsa21 were located on Mmu17 and Mmu10 as well.  Dr. Muriel Davisson of the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME, created partial trisomies for a number of syntenic chromosomal segments in the 1980s, under contract to NICHD.  One of these partial trisomies, designated Ts65Dn, proved to include approximately 150 genes located in what is considered the Down syndrome critical region of Hsa21.  During the last 15 years, various investigators have generated other models relevant to DS.  These include, but are not limited to, Ts1Cje, Ts1Rhr, Ms1Rhr, etc.  A central repository of these strains and stocks ensures their maintenance on appropriate genetic backgrounds, and that they are distributed to the research community in a timely manner.  

Objectives/Capabilities: 
The primary purposes of the mouse model repository is to continue to provide an important research tool to the research community by providing a range of murine resources for biomedical, behavioral, and biobehavioral research relevant to cytogenetic disorders, particularly Down syndrome. 

To be deemed capable of developing and maintaining the Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders the offeror must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates their experience and ability to:

1) Breed various strains of mice with known genetic background, which will produce chromosomally unbalanced gametes, resulting in complete and partial trisomic and monosomic embryos with special emphasis on mouse chromosome 16, but including relevant regions of chromosome 17 and chromosome 10, that are similar to human chromosome 21. The Ts65Dn mouse strain is particularly relevant for studies of human Down syndrome.

2) Establish and maintain a production facility to ensure that adequate numbers of mice are available to the research community and that there is an adequate supply of female mice for purposes of prenatal studies and for breeding to allow establishment of separate colonies by investigators with substantial research needs.

3) Refine procedures to freeze embryos that can be rescued by thawing and reimplanting them in pseudopregnant mice.

4) Distribute the animal models to investigators approved by NICHD in a timely and expeditious manner with appropriate approval and tracking processes as outlined by the NICHD Project Officer.  

5) Test the animals periodically for pathogens.

6) Publicize the availability of mouse models indicating the type of strains in the colony, as well as detailed information about the strain phenotype, genotype, protocols for genotyping, husbandry conditions, and other details as specified by the Project Officer

7) Characterize the clinical and behavioral phenotypes of the mouse models.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.   
If any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirement, they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement, proposal, or quotation for consideration to the address provided below.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 10 pages and it should clearly address each of the competencies stated above. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement would be 541711.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

Capability Statement should be sent to the  attention of Seena Mathews, Contracting Officer, at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on July 2, 2009.  The address where capability statements should be mailed to is:

The U.S. Agency for International Development Mission to Ghana (USAID/Ghana) intends to seek proposals from qualified organizations that are interested in providing services to develop and implement a comprehensive and integrated performance measurement, monitoring and results reporting system for USAIDs education activities in Ghana.  The Performance Monitoring and Reporting (PMR) system shall be comprised of components that will enable the USAID/Ghana Mission to fulfill its performance measurement, reporting and dissemination requirements as mandated in the Automated Directives System (ADS) and other Agency requirements including Operational Plan and Performance Reporting documentation.  Based on need, the Contractor shall also assist the Mission on reporting on ad-hoc requests required by USAID/Washington, USAID/Ghana, the Ghana Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ghana Education Service (GES).

The intended specific result of the PMR activity is to ensure the provision of timely, reliable and valid data to support performance reporting and dissemination of information on the Missions education assistance strategy in Ghana.

USAID plans to award a cost plus fixed fee, completion type contract for a total period of one year with option to extend for two additional years. Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of organization (US or non-US, large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.

Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to the availability of funds. This pre-solicitation notice in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, no less than 15 days after this notice. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be taken.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office space in a building under lease in Juneau, Alaska, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 7,300 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related use space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 7,300 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for ten years/five years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 30, 2009.  The building must be located within the following delineated area:

South Boundary: Juneau Airport
North Boundary: Glacier Highway
East Boundary: Jordan
West Boundary: Radcliffe Road

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.

The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety, Seismic Safety and Handicapped Accessibility. 

Please send expressions of interest to the following person and address in writing, via email, or via fax, and provide site address, size and offered square footage, date of space availability, expected rental rate per useable square foot fully-serviced and whether or not the quoted rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source modification to Contract No. 283-05-0092.

Contract Title:  The National Analytic Center (NAC) for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and Other Data

Contractor:  RTI International, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194.

The purpose of this modification is to provide additional funds to the contract for an independent and comprehensive evaluation of substance abuse data surveillance systems across the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  This activity has been mandated by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the purpose of improving data collection, reducing costs, and promoting efficiency.

Substance abuse data are collected in a variety of surveys sponsored by the DHHS.  Some surveys, such as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA); and Monitoring the Future (MTF), sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); are specifically targeted at determining the incidence and prevalence of illicit and licit drugs in the country as a whole and in specific sub-populations.  Other data collection efforts, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), collect some drug use data as part of a broader health survey.  

At a minimum, the contractor will be required to review all of the DHHS data collection activities that gather data on substance use and abuse and present a final report on the findings.

Demonstration of Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications:

The evaluation of DHHS substance abuse data surveillance systems and data collections requires a contractor with specific knowledge and experience related to analysis of substance abuse data and data collection methods, as well as in-depth expertise on the major DHHS substance abuse data collections.  The current contractor, RTI International, is uniquely qualified to conduct this evaluation based on a number of salient factors.  First, RTI has been the NSDUH contractor for over a decade and has sufficient expertise  operationally and topically - in the largest substance abuse survey sponsored by DHHS.  Second, RTI also has had significant expertise in BRFSS as the primary contractor for this activity.  In addition, staff at RTI routinely use the MTF data as a benchmark for NSDUH.  Finally, RTI currently serves the SAMHSA Office of Applied Studies (OAS) as the key analytic contractor on all major survey activities: the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), and the Drug Abuse Services Information System (DASIS).  The staff expertise available through this contractor will enable SAMHSA to start the project immediately, to conduct it efficiently, and to bring it to conclusion within the shortest possible timeframe.  

Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

At this time, RTI International is the only contractor that will be able to provide the required services.  This review and analysis task requires all key personnel to have expert knowledge in substance abuse topics, data collection methods and analysis, including the three (3) key OAS surveys and other major DHHS drug use surveys.  The current NAC contract has another 1- years of performance activities remaining.  This modification provides for additional work required to meet the OMB request for evaluation of DHHS substance abuse data surveillance systems.  Award to another contractor for this work would be time and cost prohibitive. 

This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1))Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capabilities received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Telephone request will not be honored.Request for a copy of the solicitation by be emailed to ryan.jorgensen@us.army.mil. This will b e a firm fixed price contract. This project will focus on the development of a support group environment for amputees and their families. Support groups have proven to be extremely helpful to patients with a variety of different illnesses.  Studies have shown that a patients major concern is that of dying alone, either literally or figuratively.  The second major concern is that of having unmanaged pain.  There have been at least 45 studies of support groups that have looked at quality of life.  Overall they have shown that the quality of life has been much improved by the use of simple support groups.  Patients have been better able to cope with pain, have less psychological distress with reduced anxiety, reduced depression and have had increased physical activity.  We therefore believe that giving patients and their families access to a virtual support group environment will enable them to have access to a critical resource which they may not be able to be part of in the physical world. We also believe that this virtual support group environment will be readily adopted by those with physical disabilities as it has already been demonstrated the physically disabled are currently active in virtual worlds.

Ports of Cartagena and Contecar Central Security and Customs Facility Feasibility Study.
The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the two ports.
The objective of this feasibility study in Colombia is to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagenas (SPRC) Ports of Cartagena and Contecar, which are located 15 kilometers apart.  Over the past 13 years, SPRCs container traffic has multiplied seven-fold, and its facilities can handle over 1,000,000 TEUs and 600,000 tons of bulk cargo per year.  SPRC succeeded in obtaining a U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) designation for the Port of Cartagena. 
The Feasibility Study would support the development of a central customs and security system to serve these two ports operated by SPRC, and possibly other terminals in the area.   The project will supplement and expand container handling capacity at Cartagena and improve SPRCs competitive position.  SPRC intends to extend Cartagenas Terminal Operating System to the Port of Contecar by connecting the terminal security of the two operations with technology such as fiber optic cabling and wireless transmitters.
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks:
(1) review existing security and customs clearance systems, (2) identify and evaluate potential sites for the central security and customs facility, (3) interim presentation, (4) development and environmental impacts, (5) performance specifications and implementation plan, and (6) final report and presentation.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:
https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp
Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.
Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Kotoka International Airport
Accra, Ghana
Phone: +233 21 776171
The Grantee, the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Kotoka International Airport Air Traffic Control Center Project in Ghana.
Ghana has experienced strong growth in air traffic over the past 10 years, with annual aircraft movements almost doubling since 2002, and has an extensive Flight Information Region (FIR) including the upper air space for Benin and Togo.  The current Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at the country's primary international airport is overcrowded and poorly located.  This feasibility study will provide GCAA with the specifications and location for the new facility as well as recommend the equipment needed to accommodate both near-term traffic and projected traffic over the next 15 years.
Ghana's current ATCC, which falls under the responsibility of GCAA, is located in the tower building at ACC and is directly adjacent to the main passenger terminal.  The ATCC space is very constrained, housing personnel for air traffic control for Ghana, Benin and Togo as well as emergency services.  GCAA has determined that air traffic control and emergency services should be re-located to a new facility.  GCAA's plans are for a facility with six air traffic control positions, which will allow for supervisory and training stations.  Additionally, there will be facilities for an emergency rescue control center.  The new ATCC will permit safer handling of Ghana's airspace, the adoption of the latest air traffic control technologies and a self-contained, more secure facility.
The objective of this grant is to provide GCAA with an evaluation of its current assumptions and plans and propose specifications and location for the new facility as well as related equipment requirements.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $295,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Contracts Management, intends to negotiate, on a Sole Source Basis, with the Regents of the University of California, University of California, San Francisco, Office of Sponsored Research, 3333 California Street, Suite 315, San Francisco, CA 94143-0962.  The contract objectives are to:  (1)serve as a coordinating agent and national link to relevant domestic and international, public and private sector,  patient safety resources and information; (2) maintain, monitor, and enhance a national, Web-based learning program for health care providers that relies on reports of near misses, medical errors, and patient harm/injury assiciated with or the direct result of health care delivery; (3) advance learning about patient safety by providing downloadable slide sets based on a monthly WebM&M case and offering CME/CEU credits, etc., as appropriate for selected categories of professionals and trainees; (4) develop and maintain appropriate partnerships to enhance and expand content availability.  The period of performance will be for two (2) years with three (3) one (1) year option periods.  The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) has been the Contractor for the AHRQ WebM&M since September 2001.  As such, UCSF has developed unique trust levels, skills in confidential transactions, professional relationships, and a successful, anonymous payment system to support this project.  Of particular value is the level of trust developed between UCSF and users of the site.  There have been no breach in the confidentially/anonymity required to gather cases, work with those health care professionals submitting cases for review, and provide appropriate payment as incentives to submit usable cases.  The ability of the Contractor to provide these services in a confidential/anonymous way is a fundamental building block of this extremely successful program that provides readily available and actionable information for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety.  Without the Contractor's ability to carry-out these efforts in a confidential/anonymous manner, the program would fail.  The level of trust with a new Contractor is something that has to be earned over a period of time.  The level of trust of a new Contractor would not be the same and this could possibly threaten the viability of this program which is a critical part of AHRQ's patient safety portfolio -- designed to help reduce medical errors and improve patient safety.

Interested parties should FAX their Capability Statement relevant to this requirement (no more than 10 singled spaced pages) with the subject:  Sources Sought (SS) AHRQ-09-10025, to the Contract Specialist at fax number: 301-427-1740, not later than 5:00pm on June 4, 2009.  All faxed responses to this notice will be considered by AHRQ.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>David Gregorovic, (937) 904-4456

<a href="mailto:david.gregorovic@wpafb.af.mil;">david.gregorovic@wpafb.af.mil;</a>
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):  Health & Usage Monitoring System for MQ-9

Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct Market Research which will be used to develop program plans and an acquisition strategy for a Health and Usage Monitoring System for the MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to provide reliable in-flight, real-time diagnostic and prognostic analysis of aircraft systems to enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and improved mission reliability.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred responding to this RFI.
The MQ-9 Program is attempting to determine if sources are available in the near-term to meet the requirements as stated below for a Health and Usage Monitoring System that enables Condition Based Maintenance and improved mission reliability.  A key focus of this RFI will be on determining if there are suppliers with production systems readily available for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) applications that can be integrated into the MQ-9 fleet.   The purpose of this effort is to identify suppliers that have developed, integrated, tested, and fielded Health and Usage Monitoring systems for commercial and military aircraft applications for possible integration and incorporation into the MQ-9.  
Sources Sought:  The objective of this RFI is to identify potential health and usage monitoring systems that provide the required operational and maintenance benefits to the MQ-9 program in a readily available timeframe.  Emphasis on production ready hardware integrated on military aircraft is of special interest.  Since this is a market research activity at this time only, general program and technical information on the respondent's system is only required in response to this RFI. Requirements Guidelines:  The primary objective of a Health and Usage Monitoring System for the MQ-9 is to improve flight safety, mission reliability and effectiveness, as well as increases fleet operational readiness while reducing fleet operating and maintenance costs.  The goal is a Condition Based Maintenance capability.  In order to meet the stated objectives, the Health and Usage Monitoring System for the MQ-9 should include these key capabilities:
.	Reliable in-flight, real-time automatic diagnostic and predictive failure /prognostic analysis capability.  The MQ-9 currently utilizes a Data Logger/Signal Plotter Program for post mishap analysis that provides no provisions for control, health monitoring, diagnostic or prognostic analysis.     .	User-friendly interface for operator, maintenance and ground personnel for advisory, data monitoring, analysis, and reporting. .	Readily available for integration into the MQ-9.  Previous integration into other military aircraft of production systems is of particular interest.
Operational Requirements:  The on-board health and usage monitoring system must be able to meet the environmental conditions and operating environment of the MQ-9.  The MQ-9 is a medium-altitude, high endurance aircraft powered by a turbo-prop engine.  The aircraft can support the standard industry communication interfaces. 
Due Date:  Packages shall be mailed to the undersigned and received no later than 19 June 09.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances  the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

The incumbents actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.

<DESC>Description:  	Approach to the Understanding and Predicting
Excipient Properties and Functionality

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses) for approach to the Understanding and Predicting Excipient Properties and Functionality.

This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If in the future a official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this will be included on the source list.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  FDA may consider soliciting services for a base year and one option year firm fixed price contract.

Objectives:

The ultimate goal of this project is to establish an information system that is used to maintain values of fundamental pharmaceutical excipient material properties, and which contains models, best practices, and methods for using this data in the systematic design of pharmaceutical products and processes.  This system will be publicly accessible in order to improve the efficacy, quality, and efficiency of manufacturers products, and improve the science for establishing industry guidances. Physical property databases for various material classes are common in other fields of engineering; for example, there are many databases of material properties on the NIST website .  These standardized and reliable material properties are indispensable to an engineer who is designing an industrial product and process.  Currently, there are no such databases for the physical properties of pharmaceutical excipients.

Draft Scope of Work:

The proposed work is the first part of a larger program to identify, measure, and provide useful models for predicting excipient properties that affect the performance of solid dosage formulations.  The current proposal focuses on materials from three excipient classes used in virtually all immediate release direct compression tablet manufacturing.  They include a binder/diluent such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate, a disintegrant such as Na starch glycolate or pregelatinized starch and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate (MgSt).  These three excipients are the most commonly used filler/binders used in direct compression formulations, and they span the range from very ductile to very brittle materials.

Due to their significance in direct compression, they are available in numerous grades.  For example, MCC is available with a wide range of particle sizes, densities, and moisture contents.  Lactose is also available in many different grades and it comes in anhydrous, monohydrate, and spray-dried forms.  DCP is available in many different grades and it comes in anhydrous and dihydrate forms. The dihydrate form is known to dehydrate during product storage; the released water can facilitate the chemical decomposition of the API and also have an adverse effect on the properties of the finished dosage form.  Super disintegrants such as sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and crospovidone or traditional disintegrants such as starch and pregelatinized starch are commonly used in most direct compression formulations.  These come in fewer grades than the filler/binders; however, the different disintegrants have different disintegration mechanisms, which need to be understood when formulating in tablet or capsule formulations.  With lubricants MgSt is the most commonly used disintegrant, and one of the most problematic excipients that merits intensive study.

The product (tablet) performance criteria will include:  intra- and inter-tablet content uniformity, mechanical durability (breakage and attrition resistance), and disintegration.  In addition to providing data, procedures, and recommendations useful to the FDA and industrial formulators for the proposed excipients, these activities will also serve as a template for future work expanding the range of excipients and manufacturing pathways. 

The proposed research will involve the following main deliverables for each excipient:

	Review the literature (including journal articles, handbooks, standards, trade articles, and interviews with industrial representatives) to:

	Provide a work plan to coordinate timelines and the following deliverables:
	Identify material parameters that are critical to achieving the targeted final dosage form functional properties and provide a summary report to the FDA.
	Compile reported measurements of these material parameters including information related to how the measurement was made (e.g., measurement method, equipment model, measurement uncertainties, etc.) and provide a summary report to FDA.
	Identify how property variability impacts processing behavior and final dosage form variability and provide a summary report to FDA.
	Compile common test methods and standards for measuring significant material properties.  The most reliable best of class methods will be identified and documented and provide a summary report to FDA.
	Compile a list of models, including assumptions, limitations, and accuracy, that relate the excipient properties to manufacturing parameters and the final dosage form properties and provide a summary report to FDA. 
	A comprehensive report detailing the overall findings will be delivered.  In addition, NIPTE will hold an interactive workshop to present the results of our report findings with scientists from the FDA, industry, and academia invited to attend.

We may anticipate a labor hour type contract with a base year and one year option.

Viable parties shall provide the following:

Part A. Capabilities and Technical Experience  Provide a capability statement describing how your company can provide us with an approach to the Understanding and Predicting Excipient Properties and Functionality listed in the Draft Scope of Work.

Part B.  Size of Business- Please provide your business size and submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firms status.

<DESC>Oil and Gas Resource and Economic Evaluation Modeling Software for the Outer Continental Shelf
PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a hybrid type contract with fixed price and cost reimbursable line items, with an anticipated period of performance of a twelve (12) month base year and four (4) option years for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services.
BACKGROUND: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has the responsibilities to manage mineral leasing, exploration, and development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) lands. The Offshore Energy and Minerals Management program (OEMM) (www.mms.gov/offshore), being one of two major MMS programs, regulates all OCS energy and mineral activities, ranging from resource assessment and lease offerings through exploration, production, and decommissioning. It also ensures that the public receives fair market value for lease rights conveyed on the OCS.  OEMM has its headquarters located in Herndon, VA, and regional offices in Camarillo, CA, New Orleans, LA and Anchorage, AK.
The OEMM Regional Directors are responsible for determining the adequacy of qualified high bids offered for tracts included in OCS oil and gas lease sales. In order to make this determination prior to awarding oil and gas leases on the OCS, the MMS utilizes a proprietary Tract Evaluation Model.  It employs classical Discounted Cash Flow Analysis and Monte Carlo simulation in order to build feasible scenarios for exploration and production of the hydrocarbon resources on a leased tract. The Tract Evaluation Model computes a range of net present values for the evaluated tract, and the mean of that range is taken as a threshold value. Based on comparisons of the bids offered at the MMS lease sales by the prospective lessees with the threshold value per tract, the Regional Director is able to make acceptance or rejection decision with respect to the high bid on a tract. The same model also serves as an analytical tool in support of policy making with respect to lease terms, suspension volumes, royalties, and new governmental regulations.OBJECTIVE/GOAL:  The objective of this effort is to acquire a customized commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software package and technical support enabling MMS to conduct resource and economic evaluation of OCS tracts, based on a diverse set of economic, engineering, geological, geophysical, and other input parameters.  The customized software COTS should be able to carry out Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, preferably with Real Options, while evaluating multiple exploration and production scenarios on a per-tract (OCS lease block) basis. It should be able to compute Minimum Economic Field Sizes (MEFS) related to oil and gas development projects, allow for fixed and sliding scale royalties, and utilize stochastic oil and gas price modeling concepts.The desired outcome of this effort is to replace the existing proprietary OEMM Tract Evaluation Model with the customized software COTS, to improve the current economic modeling capabilities of OEMM, to incorporate industry evaluation techniques into the MMS workflow, and to provide alternative, non-Government sources of software solutions and user support.
HOW TO RESPOND: For a full copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Lisa A. Algarin via email at lisa.algarin@mms.gov.  Please include in your request the Solicitation Number M09PS00067 and title Oil and Gas Resource and Economic Evaluation Modeling Software for the Outer Continental Shelf, your organizations name, point of contact, Dunn & Bradstreet number, address, telephone and fax numbers and email address.  Requests must be made no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time/Date: June 4, 2009. PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>(RECOVERY ACT) The National Institute of Aging (NIA), IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a competitive basis for the purchase of the following equipment listed below under Simplified Acquisition procedures.  This notice may represent the only official notice.1.FACSLoader For FACSCanto IIProduct #:342065 The laboratory of Central Lab Services Flow Cytometry requires FACSLoader to be added to existing FacsCanto II equipment, the addition of the FACSLoader will provide the needed upgrade for the core lab that functions as the primary instrument for all analysis (non-sorting samples) which serves the NIA IRP.This is a 3-laser 8 color analyzer, presently samples are loaded manually (single tube) as opposed to a carousel-type loader which had been on the analyzer which the Canto II replaced.  The operation of the manual arm has been extremely problematic with weekly failures and repeated service calls.  The FACSLoader was not ordered with the original Canto II as a result of the present version currently in production at the time of the order was of similar belt-driven design to our previous instrument and also prone to problems.  The re-engineered version is upgraded to gear driven.Replacement of the manual arm with a loader will allow easier analysis of samples with the ability to derive tube work list that will automatically sample and acquire tubes.  Selected users from other labs access this equipment (Laboratory of Immunology and Cardiovascular Science) on weekends evening, holidays, and between our current workload and this will facilitate their abilities to acquire flow cytometric analysis with less down-time as we are currently experiencing with the manual arm and will aid them and us in not loosing samples when the arm malfunctions.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice is a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received on or before May 28, 2009 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.This is a solicitation for non commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 16.2, utilizing competitive procedures.  These procedures include those identified under Subparts 6.1, 6.2 (Full and Open Competition and Full and Open Competition after Exclusions of Sources), and FAR Section 16.505(b) (1).  The solicitation number is NIHAG2009064 and is issued as a request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions clauses are those in which the FAR has amended to incorporate for use in Recovery Act actions FAR subpart 5.7 for pre-solicitation and award notices.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 and the business size standard is small.Only electronic offers will be accepted. Offers are due to Mr. M.

In vivo imaging acquisition and analysis techniques have advanced dramatically in recent years, and these approaches have proved particularly informative for research in nonhuman primate models, where animals availability, logistical and ethical considerations constrain experimental designs.  In addition, the widespread utilization of vivo imaging in human research provides a basis for direct comparison with observations in experimental nonhuman primate models, enhancing translational potential.  Unfortunately, there is currently no on-site instrumentation or support for in vivo imaging research at the NIH Animal Center.  This represents a significant limitation to effectively capitalizing on the unique animal resources of the NIH, and it is a significant obstacle toward advancing translation research initiatives of the NIA and other ICs.Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

<DESC><p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Lockheed Martin Corporation, Moorestown, NJ, for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) system engineering, technical, and programmatic support maintenance services for the SPY-1A phased array radar. The scope of the proposed purchase order involves continued support for the troubleshooting, repairing and testing of SPY-1A and related equipment system interfaces to facilitate the NOAA National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL), Norman Oklahoma, operations and testing efforts, equipment maintenance, configuration management support, training for Spy-1A equipment operation and casualty recovery. The proposed purchase order will be a one year bridge in which time a follow-on contract will be negotiated.
<p>The NSSL and a consortium of ten organizations, including the Department of Commerce, the FAA, Department of Navy and the University of Oklahoma, constructed the National Weather Radar Test bed (NWRT) in Norman, Oklahoma. The US Navy loaned a battle spare SPY-1A, and related equipment, core to the Aegis Weapon System (AWS), to the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). The Aegis system, named for the impenetrable shield in Greek and Roman mythology, was designed as a total weapon system, from detection to kill. The heart of the system is an advanced, automatic detect and track, multi-function phased-array radar, the SPY-1A. The NSSL is adapting that technology for weather applications, focusing on developing faster and more accurate warning, analysis and forecasting techniques for severe and hazardous weather. The NWRT is also the core of the Multifunctional Phased Array Radar (MPAR), a tri-agency partnership between the Departments of Commerce, Transportation (FAA) and Defense. In addition to weather applications, MPAR also addresses aircraft surveillance and homeland security functions.</p>
<p>Per a Memorandum of Agreement with the Navy and the FAA, NOAA is required to maintain the radar in good battle ready operating condition for the duration of the loan. In order to maintain the equipment in the battle ready state and meet the requirements of the MOA, maintenance services and replacement parts are required from Lockheed Martin. As the original SPY-1A equipment designer and manufacturer for the Navy, Lockheed Martin has extensive experience and background in the design/development, production and integration, operation and maintenance for the SPY1A radar. Lockheed Martin is the only known manufacturer of parts for the SPY-1A radar and NSSL's agreement to maintain the system in battle readiness requires contract support services from Lockheed Martin. The proposed purchase order is for one year and in that time period a contract will be negotiated.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the service that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurrement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.&nbsp; Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this is a Request for Information (RFI). The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to aid the United States Navy in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to proceed with a competitive procurement for the production of Video Improvement Effort (VIE) Assemblies.  The VIE provides a display for Photonics Mast Variant (PMV) viewing and processing.  The VIE assembly should include all items provided to the Navy for SSGN submarine deployment, including but not limited to: the display and controls, the handgrip connection, video capture hardware and processors.  The VIE supports all 3 PMV Cameras and is installed on the SSGN Class submarines with TI04.
The purpose of the VIE will be to provide PMV training to SSGN Combat Control crews as part of the Submarine Multi-Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT) shore-based facilities in Bangor and King's Bay.  SMMTT performs visual simulation for periscope that is currently provided to the Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS) and Type-8 Periscope Mockups at these facilities.  The VIE was recently added to the SSGN Combat Control Area due to latency issues with video streaming to ISIS.  The VIE is an intelligent display which you can interact with and has several overlays and functions, all of which are assumed required for adequate training of Combat Control Personnel.  SMMTT visual simulation for all 3 cameras would be provided to the VIE in the same form as provided to the VIE by the PMV cameras on the SSGN submarine (e.g. SDI w/ matching resolutions and refresh rates).
This RFI is intended to gather information regarding possible technical solutions and their characteristics.  NUWCDIVNPT's goal is to use the information collected to develop an acquisition strategy for a competitive best value acquisition. NUWCDIVNPT requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, affordability, weight, size and power requirements of the proposed approach. Responses should be limited to five pages for any given concept. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a soli! citation based on responses received. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by NUWCDIVNPT from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Failure to respond to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  In order to comply with scheduling priorities, responders are asked to provide feedback by no later than close of business (COB) June 19, 2009. RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to: Mr. Carlos Tavares, Code 252, NUWCDIVNPT, 1176 Howell Street, Newport, RI, 02841. e-mail Carlos.Tavares@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate administers programs to develop, test and evaluate, and transition to commercialization next-generation technologies required to effectively counter potential attacks on the Nation.  DHS S&T achieves this goal through sponsorships and partnerships with the private sector, National Laboratories, universities, and other government agencies (both domestic and foreign).  The Chem/Bio Division of DHS S&T supports this mission by identifying and developing technologies for transition to DHS operational components that are needed to reduce the probability and potential consequences of a biological pathogen or a chemical attack on the nations civilian population, its infrastructure, or its agricultural system.  

DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have indentified a need to detect and identify chemical, biological, explosive (CBE) and contraband materials being transported in cargo, parcels, and luggage, to deter the transportation of these materials and to increase their interdiction effectiveness.  CBP and TSA share a mission to secure our borders and transportation systems, not only from a devastating attack using CBE materials, but also in the discovery and capture of smuggled narcotics, weapons, agricultural products, stowaways, and other contraband materials.  In order to meet these challenges, new inspection and detection tools are necessary that will be able to detect and identify a wide range of threats and suspicious materials, rapidly alert operators to the presence of suspicious materials, and synthesize information from disparate sources for decision support.

DHS S&T is initiating a multi-layered research and development approach to addressing this technology need.  The components of an effective CBE and contraband detection architecture that DHS S&T will be developing are:

	Non-intrusive inspection technologies to detect anomalies and support targeting efforts;
	Sensors to be installed and operated in containers during transit, such as inside cargo shipping containers, railcars, trucks, and air cargo holds;
	Sample collection and preparation techniques to extract samples from various shipping containers and packaging materials;
	Secondary inspection sensors for identification and confirmation of threats and contraband;
	Data management and decision support tools; and,
	Test and evaluation support.

This solicitation will be focused on the development and fielding of sensors for secondary inspection and detection confirmation.  The sensors developed under this project will be expected to function within the current supply chain infrastructure and security architecture described above.

<DESC>Next Generation Mail Processing Technologies:

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is initiating a new acquisition program entitled Next Generation Mail Processing Solution to identify participants and sources of supply, capable of providing research and development, design, and in or out sourced manufacturing for a new state-of-the-art, automated, mail processing design solution.  This solution will be deployed to sort and sequence the high volume of letter and flat mail currently processed within USPS facilities nationwide.

This market notice and supply chain opportunity is ultimately seeking suppliers who can offer new or not previously fielded concepts or variations of existing equipment, having an achievable maturation path leading to deployable equipment commencing within the next six years.

This initial notice is providing for market research and publication of opportunity, with a following step of additional discussions related to supplier capabilities and qualifications for inclusion within a competitive process toward the above goal.

Current Mail Processing Operational Information:

Currently, the Postal Service processes approximately 550 million letter and flat mail pieces at 283 processing facilities each day.  The USPS segregates letter and flat shaped mail as it enters processing, and this separation is maintained throughout the sorting process.  Our existing automated process yields a high volume of sorted mail to a finite number of delivery points.  Several high speed processing runs are performed each day to accommodate all delivery points within a single mail processing centers coverage area.  Letter and flat mail is manually merged during the final processing operations by our street carriers for delivery to the addressee.

NGMPS Program Objectives:

The NGMPS Program Objective is to deploy a system solution which will be capable of efficiently, reliably and accurately delivery point sequencing both letter and flat mail simultaneously within a merged mail stream and within the same system.  As space is a cost consideration for the USPS, the solution should utilize and accomplish this task within the smallest footprint possible.  The required output of the system is a single, combined mail stream for letter and flat mail in delivery point sequence order.  Designed solutions should consider the use of specifically designed letter and flat mail input subsystems, or use feeders currently deployed within the Postal Service.  Deployment of equipment to individual delivery units is not desired and does not meet the Postal Services future vision.  Competitive factors for success will be sort and sequence accuracy, time to process, and the systems ability to support our established high standards of service for the American people.  Additional factors are projected to be development cost to bring to market, system reliability, accept rate, labor cost to operate, and overall space required to accomplish the mission.  Finally through NGMPS, the USPS seeks a system which can be deployed nationally and incrementally to provide maximum flexibility to delivery point sequence letter and flat shaped mail within existing and future Postal Service infrastructure.  

Future Mail Trend Impact on NGMPS:

Research indicates a shift in mailing trends propelled by the numerous means of communication options available to business and consumers today.  These trends are characterized by slower mail volume growth and continued increases in the number of delivery points.  As volume growth slows, emphasis must shift to accommodate more delivery points with less volume.  A new solution with processing based upon the volume of mail available, with delivery points as the variable, would provide an opportunity to streamline operations.  Processing letter and flat shaped mail on one system (using either a single induction feeder or multiple induction feeders to accommodate the varying mail shapes) would eliminate the manual merging process, improve efficiencies, and reduce costs.  The most efficient processing scenario would be a one feed solution for letter and flat mail, independent of delivery points, limited only by a maximum volume, which would provide a merged letter and flat mail product in delivery point order. The NGMPS Program is seeking such a solution.

NGMPS Acquisition Approach:

The Postal Service will provide for a supplier prequalification and competitive process through identified Phases leading to test and production deployment.  The Postal Service is reviewing alternative approaches to ensure that it provides for selection of a best value solution which ensures supply base availability to support future deployment phases, quantity acquisitions, and system upgrades.

Suppliers interested in responding to this announcement wishing to participate in this program should send their contact information to Ms. Tammi Robinson-Minor, Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist, United States Postal Service, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA  22082-8150.  Email address is tammi.robinson-minor@usps.gov.  Telephone:  (703) 280-7885.  Telephone inquires and questions will be addressed, however, for action concerning participation, inquiries must be in writing.  Suppliers should provide for notification of interest as soon as practicable, and in no event later than December 15, 2008. 

Upon required written notification of interest, the USPS will provide additional information for supplier response within a prequalification process, with successful suppliers moving forward to Request for Proposal (RFP) participation. 

NGMPS Phase I Acquisition Schedule/Time Line:

It is envisioned that development and deployment of the NGMPS will be contracted for in phases.  Phase I will include a study, concept design, and simulation deliverable.  Simulation analysis is critical in demonstrating the potential USPS return on investment of the developed concept to substantially and positively impact USPS infrastructure in mail processing, transportation, logistic and delivery operations.   

Phase II is planned as an equipment build and component test phase, with participation planned for those suppliers, and their manufacturing source if applicable, who submitted concept designs and simulations which were considered by the Postal Service as best value in the ability of the design concept to meet operational needs.  Phase II will be divided into subsequent equipment build phases, which might include major component bread board, prototype, or pre-production phases depending upon the maturation level of the proposed solution.  

It is anticipated that the USPS will issue a Statement of Objectives (SOO) to pre-qualified sources in January 2009, and that contracts for Phase I as described would be awarded no later than April 2009.  A subsequent announcement prior to RFP issuance in January will identify all pre-qualified participants. 

This announcement of program initiation does not in any way commit the USPS to contract, test, or purchase any equipment or make any award as a result of this publication and notice.

<DESC>This notification fulfills the requirements set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.2 entitled "Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions."  The purpose of this notification is to announce the modification of Order 101819M295 - Marine National Monuments Compatibility Determinations and Appropriateness Findings Project.
Additional work will be placed with Big Foot Consulting that extends the performance work period and increase the quantity of the Compatibility Determination and Appropriateness Finding Documents.  Big Foot Consulting was awarded a contract on February 26, 2009 to develop a permitting system based on the contractor's existing knowledge, skills, and time spent previously working in Service policy and regulations.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex has been assigned administrative responsibility for three new marine national monuments in the Central and Western Pacific as of January 2009, major areas of which are now part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.  The Presidential Proclamations establishing the Monuments contain several time-sensitive mandates, including development of a permitting system in consultation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Before issuing permits, however, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must ensure the permitted use is compatible with the purpose(s) for which refuge system units (including major areas of these monuments) were established.
Use of any other offeror would result in substantial duplication of costs and time delays to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.  The estimated dollar value for the additional work is estimated to be approximately $3,840.00

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Newport Corporation of Irvine, CA for the purchase of Newport XPS-C8 Controller System to be used in the Physics Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)
The Sole Source determination is based on the need for the Newport XPS-C8 Controller System with Motors to operate in accordance with the original equipment specifications from the manufacturer. 

The Nano-Scale Metrology group (NSMG) at NIST has the need to purchase a precision motion control system complete with four linear translation stages and two rotation stages to integrate into an in-house built microscope system for performing semiconductor metrology measurements.  This equipment will be used for the purpose of customizing and engineering the illumination and collection paths of our microscope.

It is necessary that we purchase the Newport XPS-C8 controller system with the MFA-CC linear translation motors and PR-50 rotation motors for two reasons.  We have this same XPS-C8 system integrated into three other in-house designed microscope systems within NSMG. To start over with a new control system would result in the massive unnecessary effort to write and test control and data acquisition code.  Second, it is also necessary to purchase this XPS-C-8 system for interchangeability.  It is important to keep all of our instruments running without delay.  By having the same equipment on all instruments, we have the flexibility to move controllers and stages around to accommodate normal equipment failure.

 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on June 5, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to Life Imaging Services, Efringerstrasse 79, CH-4057 Basel, Switzerland for a Custom Biosafety and Environmental Chamber.  This company based in Switzerland has designed an environmental chamber referred to as the Cube & Box that comes as standard option with all Leica two photon microscopes. To control environmental variables such as temperature and humidity, Leica has worked exclusively with Life Imaging Services.   The chamber encloses the microscope stage and can provide temperature/humidity control for intravital imaging studies.  Life Imaging Services has the capability construct a custom environmental chamber that controls environmental variables and provides BSL-2/3 protection.  The device will consist of an outer Box that will control temperatures and filter air through a HEPA filter system.  A stage-top incubator (or inner chamber) will be located inside the box.  This chamber will be portable (permitting transport to and from surgical stations), humidified, fit exactly on the Leica stage, and have a second HEPA filtration system installed.  The resultant chamber will provide a combination of environmental and biosafety control, and will be flexible enough in design to permit imaging of a many different tissues in the future.  Because Leica works exclusively with Life Imaging Service for the design and installation of environmental chambers, there is no other vendor available to fabricate the required chamber.  
Life Science Imaging is the only company that can provide a custom biosafety and environmental chamber that can fit directly onto Leica SP5 two proton microscopes and control the aforementioned environmental variables.  
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt for the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may indentify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

The contractor shall provide technical expertise in assessing each individual waiver request's technical strengths and weaknesses. The contractor shall provide a summary report on each waiver request to help inform Regional decision-making on these requests. Work to be preformed under this contract shall include:<br /><br />&bull; Collect and log all requests for waivers.<br />&bull; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with one of the justifications under ARRA.<br />&bull; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates when needed to evaluate waiver requests.<br />&bull; Prepare a report on each waiver documenting the steps taken in evaluating the waiver request and an analysis focusing on the individual waiver request's technical strengths and weaknesses.<br />&bull; Provide copies of all documentation used in the evaluation.<br />&bull; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<SUBJECT>RFI - Topics Related to Chemical Detection Technologies
<SOLNBR>RFI051909DHSST
<RESPDATE>060909
<CONTACT>Angela Ervin, Program Manager, Email angela.ervin@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology (DHS S&T) Directorate is seeking suggestions for topics for technical review workshops in the area of novel analytical technologies for the detection of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs).  The topics can be from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 to 9.

The first technical workshop will be focused on the topic of a Detect to Warn system for the detection and early warning of CB(RNE) releases inside office buildings and transportation facilities.  This system should include an open architecture and be able to be integrated into command and control centers.  All developers/vendors that would like to brief their proposed methodology which addresses this topic area should submit a quad chart (details below) describing their approach for consideration.

The second technical workshop will be focused on the topic of a Detect to Warn system for the detection and early warning of CB(RNE) releases in outside environments, including maritime.  This system should include an open architecture and be able to be integrated into command and control centers.  All developers/vendors that would like to brief their proposed methodology which addresses this topic area should submit a quad chart (details below) describing their approach for consideration.

The third technical workshop will be focused on handheld or smaller (e.g., dosimeter) detectors utilizing a novel analytical hybridized approach for the detection of TICs and CWAs.  All developers/vendors that would like to brief their proposed methodology which addresses this topic area should submit a quad chart (details below) describing their approach for consideration.  

DHS S&T desires to host additional workshops.  Hence, a second purpose of this RFI is to solicit suggestions for other topics for subsequent workshops in the area of chemical detectors with specific targets being detection of both CWAs and TICs focused on customer requirements described below.

Background:  The Chemical and Biological Research & Development Branch within the DHS S&T Directorate currently supports the development of chemical detection systems, facility monitors and handheld devices, for the detection of a broad range of TICs and CWAs.  The facility monitors are needed to increase security of high asset buildings and transportation hubs; the handheld devices are being developed in response to a need for more accurate detectors for first responders use.  Both detector types are designed to provide detection capabilities below IDLH and near PEL levels of compounds which could be used in a terrorist attack.

New projects are expected to be initiated in FY10 as follow-on to the current chemical detector projects (see https://baa.st.dhs.gov, Past Solicitations, RA03-01, TTA 3 and 4 for details on current projects).   These workshops provide a forum for the DHS Program Manager, as well as other government Program Managers, to be briefed on novel analytical approaches which might address customer requirements and therefore might be considered for future funding.

An example of some present DHS customer requirements are:  IDLH and PEL detection (ppm to sub-ppb) capability, reduced false alarm rates (less than 1% FAR), low cost (<$10k/in lots of 10k), time to detect (<1 min), Probability of Detection (Pd = 95-99%).  The handheld device has additional requirements of light weight (<8 lbs) and battery operated (up to 8 hrs operation time on a single battery).

Workshop:   Details of the workshop (including logistics, time limitation on presentations, etc.) will be provided to selected contractors.  It is the intention of DHS S&T to host workshops at an unclassified level although a classified brief could be considered.  Contractor should indicate the need for a classified submission process if so desired to DHS S&T POC listed above.

In summary, these workshops will provide accepted applicants an opportunity to brief their technology to a panel of multiple interested government agencies.

<DESC>Synopsis: 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 561410, is to notify contractors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking competition of this requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procures.

Under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.  This synopsis is designated for 100% Small Business Set Aside competition for a Labor hour purchase order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This combined synopsis solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The FDA intends to award a purchase order for the expansion and validation of invitro assays for detection of events predictive of leukemogenic potential of retroviral vector from pre-clinical or clinical samples.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

Objective:  Define the optimal parameters and target cell for an in vitro assay method that is reproducible, sensitive, and quantifiable in detection of retroviral vector-mediated cell transformation.


BACKGROUND:

Identified Public Health Gap & Critical Path Need:  Children in a gene therapy clinical protocol for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (X-SCID) have developed leukemia as a result of insertion and subsequent activation of known human oncogenes by the retroviral vector used to treat their disease.  This tragic outcome has led many investigators in the gene therapy field to develop novel retroviral vectors with the expectation that they may provide the therapeutic benefit that the gammaretroviral vector used in France provided to the children with X-SCID but with a reduced risk of tumorigenesis.  In an effort to develop and validate an animal model that can be used to assess the relative tumorigenic risks associated with new vectors, FDA and academic investigators will assess various vectors that are under development.  While the animal model that will be used in the study can reproducibly detect retroviral vector-mediated tumorigenic events, it is time-consuming (6-14 months before tumorigenic events are detected), expensive, and requires use of animals.  In an effort to develop a method that would be faster, higher throughput, less expensive, and not require animals, study has shown that ex vivo transduction of primary cultures of murine hematopoietic stem cells can be used to detect immortalization events when subject to prolonged in vitro culture, depending on the vector structure.  We propose that the in vitro assay would not substitute for an in vivo tumorigenicity assay, but may be suitable as an initial screen of new vector types, and if the new vector was negative or had a low rate in the in vitro assay, it would then be reasonable to proceed with the more rigorous and most relevant in vivo assay to look for tumorigenicity in the mouse model.  However, prior to instituting this type of approach, the in vitro method needs to be further studied and the assay needs to be optimized and developed in order to demonstrate its reproducibility, sensitivity, and ability to be sufficiently quantitative for comparison of different vector types that may transform primary cells by different mechanisms.  The goal would be to complement the ongoing study by performing the immortalization assay on the same sets of transduced cells that are going into the mice, and in this way, one could obtain side-by-side comparisons of the relative sensitivity of each assay, as well as obtain data to define the reproducibility and reliability of the in vitro method.  If the assay proves to be suitable, then future sponsors would have a relatively inexpensive and rapid (weeks vs. months-year) assay method to perform an initial screen of novel vector constructions for assessment of relative risk. The additional advantage of using the in vitro assay for initial screens is the reduction in the use of animals for tumorigenicity testing.  Availability of an in vitro method to assess the tumorigenic likelihood of new retroviral vectors in hematopoietic cells may ultimately translate into a reduced risk to clinical trial participants, along with economic savings to the sponsors developing these novel products, and a reduction in the number of animals used for safety testing.


Scope of Work:

The methodological approach:

Indentify the target cell type, in three (3) steps.

1) Identify the primary hematopoietic cell source that provides a reliable and sensitive measure of transformation due to vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis. Different hematopoietic cell lineages will be analyzed for their relative sensitivity to transformation after vector transduction in an established replating assay.  

2) Using different retroviral vectors varying in the types of regulatory elements included in backbone, the mechanism of transformation as a function of vector backbone will be determined. Analysis of frequency of transformation events in the optimized assay and mapping of genomic integration sites will be used to elucidate the mechanism associated with different regulatory elements. The results will be used to rationally design various types of integrating vectors that can circumvent the mechanisms indentified as primary drivers of transformation events. 

3) Clonal lines (murine or human) carrying specific oncogenes will be established and tested for reversion of transformation due to down-regulated expression of the oncogene using inducible promoters, thus making the transformation phenotype conditional. These cells will be examined for resistance to oncogene down-regulation as a result of insertional mutagenesis  perhaps leading to an unrestricted, highly reproducible cell line for the transformation assay.

PART I - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT FOR NRPC BACKUP SOLUTION
Project Title: Consultation Services for Database System Migration, Land Resources Division
Park Service Representative:	Jerry Megenity					Chief IT Specialist
Project Objective:  Provide Consultation services to the Land Resources Division IT Specialists involved in migration of MIS-MDL database system from Visual FoxPro to SQL Server and Visual Studio/ADO.net.  
I. Background
The National Park Service is authorized by the United States Congress to acquire land or interest(s) in land.  The land acquisition process involves many functions with hundreds of pieces of information needed to track the acquisition process of a single tract of land.  In an effort to monitor all of the real estate interest acquired by the NPS and to assist Land Acquisition Managers in acquiring new lands, or interest in lands, the Management Information System/Master Deed Listing (MIS-MDL) was developed using Visual FoxPro.  This system is a database consisting of approximately 150,000 records and approximately 300 fields.  It is used to track the land acquisition process in the National Park Service.  It also houses deed information once the acquisition process is complete and keeps count of the official National Park Service acreage.  The information obtained from the MIS-MDL database system is used to generate a variety of reports on the current status of the LRD program. 
Microsoft has announced it will not continue development of FoxPro software; therefore, the Land Resources Division needs to migrate its existing FoxPro databases to another software platform.  It has been determined that the .NET platform utilizing SQL Server 2008 and Visual Basic 2008 will be the replacement for FoxPro in the Division.  The new solution will be a 3-layer application using presentation, business, and database classes.  Because of the drastic difference in architecture, the Land Resources Division IT Specialists need to obtain mentoring/consulting services from an expert who has experience with both the old software and the new software solution.  The NPS is seeking responses from qualified professionals to facilitate the migration process and provide professional advice on system architecture and design.
General data model is designed and SQL structure is in place, however, minor modifications may still be necessary prior to data conversion.  Basic components of the 3-layer system have been created but require refinement.   Several of the main forms have been created and are partially working.  Basic Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete functions have been put in place for some fields.  Remaining work includes finishing existing forms, addition of remaining forms, implementation of business logic rules, creation of reporting system and all reports, design of permission system, creation of Audit system, final data conversion, and final implementation.

II. TASKS
1.	Review all VB and SQL code written by Land Resources Division IT Specialists.  
2.	Provide professional advice on the various options for migration of the existing database to VB/SQL.
3.	Guide IT staff through the migration process as necessary.  As each step in the process is completed, contractor will review work done by IT staff for accuracy and offer alternatives and suggestions.
4.	Answer questions for IT staff as problems or issues arise. 
5.	Perform final data migration from FoxPro to SQL for system implementation.

III. PRODUCTS AND SCHEDULE
Products:  
1.	Code samples and snippets specific to issues the IT staff encounters.
2.	Written instructions where necessary for IT staff reference.
3.	Sample 3-Layer Application framework with sample code.
4.	Final SQL database converted from FoxPro data just prior to implementation.

Schedule:   The period of performance of this firm fixed price contract shall begin upon award of contract and last for one year.  
Location:  The majority of services can be performed by the contractor remotely.  If a site visit to the Land Resources Division in Fort Collins, CO, becomes necessary, travel expenses would be additional to this contract.
This effort is expected to take between 150 to 200 hours to complete.

IV. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY
The existing FoxPro system code/database structure and Visual Basic solution code along with SQL database for proposed system already in progress by IT staff will be provided upon award of contract.

<CONTACT>David T Reindl, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-842-6515, Fax 202-312-2792, Email d-reindl@nga.gov
<DESC>The National Gallery of Art (hereinafter "Gallery" or "NGA") is soliciting quotes for the purchase of a custom-built DVD/BluRay disk duplicating system ("Duplicator").  The Gallery seeks a proposed solution to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  The Gallery, being a repository of archival media as is the case with many museums, is often called upon to provide access to archived content for public support, educational programming, and scholarly research.  Therefore, there is frequent need for disc duplication in CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray formats, and to accurately reproduce audio, video, imaging, and data file content.

The minimum technical requirements for the Duplicator are:
 Five (5) target burner;
 Minimum 500GB hard drive with computer-grade power supply;
 Free firmware updates available by email, throughout the life of the product;
 Duplication of at least the following standards/zones: CDR, DC-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD D/L, BRD, BRD D-L, BRD-RW, BRD+RW;
 Toll-free tech support and component warranties for at least six (6) months; and
 One (1) Printer and at least two (2) cartridges for printing labels.
By submitting a quote, vendor certifies that the Duplicator quoted satisfies the above minimum requirements.

Optional features and additional information required to be provided in Vendor's quote:
 Vendor must provide a statement demonstrating responsiveness to firmware updates and quick relay of them to the NGA (I.e. How frequently/quickly will vendor provide updates to the NGA?);
 Provide a list of any additional standards/zones of media that are duplicable, in addition to the minimum types identified above;
 Provide information on any extended warranty/support available for the Duplicator in addition to the minimum six (6) months required;
 Provide a statement describing the speed and efficiency of the duplication process with the build that is quoted, as well as any available options for speed-increasing capabilities; and
 Identify any additional features provided with the quoted Duplicator. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.

The solicitation documentation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31. FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212, Evaluation-Commercial Items, is applicable to this acquisition. In addition to Price, the following Technical Factors will be used in evaluating quotes, listed in increasing order of importance: (1) Vendor's Prior Experience and (2) Ability to Provide Maximum Features.  Technical factors will be weighted slightly heavier than price. The vendor submitting (hereinafter the "Vendor) a quote is responsible for providing information in its quote sufficient to allow the Gallery to evaluate the quote using these evaluation factors. Vendors must submit a Firm-Fixed Price, including a breakdown of pricing that, at a minimum, delineates the price for the duplicator with all minimum requirements, with options priced separately.  Vendor shall provide technical documentation for all major components included in the quoted Duplicator.  Furthermore, Vendor shall provide an explanation of why the proposed combination of components would benefit the NGA and provide the NGA with the best value over a different combination of components.  The NGA may use this information in its technical evaluation of proposals.  Vendor shall also provide at least three examples of prior experience building similar custom systems for other clients.  The NGA will give preference to experience building similar systems for gallerys, museums, cultural institutions, or government agencies.  Pricing information shall be submitted separate from the technical information requested above.

The NGA intends to award a contract to the Vendor whose quote, in its entirety, demonstrates that the Vendor will provide the best value to the NGA.  An award may be made to a Vendor whose quote does not represent the lowest price or the highest technical score. The National Gallery of Art seeks proposed solutions to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  Vendors are also advised that a contract award may be made without discussion or negotiation, so vendors are encouraged to submit their best value quote. 

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition, which incorporates by reference, the following FAR clauses: 52.203-6 Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (Alt 1, OCT 1995); 52.219-8. By submitting a quote in response to this RFQ, the vendor warrants that any goods or services provided to the Gallery in satisfaction of this requirement are fit for the ordinary purposes for which they were designed, as well as the particular purpose(s) specified in the this solicitation, and any additional purposes as represented by the vendor. 

This procurement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) Business Size Standards for the NAICS code indicated in this synopsis applies.  However, all responsible large businesses able to sell all components on an eligible GWAC schedule may submit a quote by email, fax, mail, or courier service, which shall be considered by the Gallery.  No open-market quotes from large businesses will be accepted.  All quotes must be delivered to: David Reindl, Office of Procurement and Contracts (APC), 2000B South Club Drive, Landover, MD 20785; F: (202) 312-2792; P: (202)842-6515; d-reindl@nga.gov on or before the Response Date specified in this synopsis.

<DESC>Current biological detection technologies are ill equipped for the challenges posed by Enhanced, Emerging, and Advanced Agents (as defined by HSPD-18), which do not contain known physical features that are typically exploited for detection.  Detection of this broad class of threats will require the most flexible of all comparators  a database of possible signatures  not the physical comparators available today.  In the context of rapidly changing technological abilities, further developing the fundamental knowledge-base and ability to handle a diversity of samples and questions is required.  In order to meet these challenges, the Next Generation Biological Detection (NGBD) Basic Research Program will develop new understandings of sample background, approaches to environmental sample preparation, and detection of basic biological features for simple, rapid detection of threat agents including Enhanced, Emerging, and Advanced Agents which current technologies do not permit.

This BAA (09-11) is focused on research for sample preparation techniques of samples with complex background matrices such as those culled from environmental aerosol collectors.  The NGBD Program is looking for research that furthers the ability to prepare samples for RNA, DNA, and protein testing from backgrounds with complex biological components.  This work should focus on being able to separate extracellular material as well as RNA, DNA, and proteins derived from whole cells in environmental samples.  Strategies for testing sample preparation methodologies for low and high throughput assays for threat agents will be evaluated.  This will assist in the advancement of threat detection by improving the efficiency of the primary step in the process (i.e., sample preparation).

The Mead LTA is used for training activities by 37 different USAR units (approximately 1235 reservists) within 125-miles. Training exercises include small unit operations and field training activities.  There are approximately 609 acres that will be treated under this SOW.<BR><BR>References:  The 89th RRCs Invasive Species Management Plan (ISMP) was developed for the Mead LTA and priority invasive plant species were identified. Two species are listed as controlled noxious weeds under Nebraskas Noxious Weed Control Act (June 2008). The ISMP is a response to invasive species management requirements at the Local Training Areas in Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999  Invasive Species (EO 13112) (Appendix B) and subsequent Federal and DOD regulations. The Army Reserve Pest Management Report Record Form provides a standard method for recording pesticide use and other pest control information at RSC facilities.  Use of the record complies in part with Federal Regulation 40 CFR 171.11c (7) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Contractor applicators must be State certified in the appropriate categories and present this certification according to DODI 4150.07. <BR><BR>General Project Requirements: The project has three tasks and one optional task for 2010 services, which may be funded and executed at the RSCs discretion.  <BR><BR>Task 1: Kick-off Meeting: The Contractor shall arrange and lead a brief telephone kickoff meeting with the USAR POCs. The purpose of the meeting will be to ensure mutual understanding of the project SOW, schedule, and deliverables. At this meeting the government will articulate specific management objectives, if any, that should be addressed by the Contractor in implementing this SOW. The types of herbicides used and rates of application will be agreed upon in writing. The Contractor is required to submit a written plan of control to be reviewed and approved by the 88th RSC. The written plan will include types of herbicides to be used and the rate of application.  Product labels and MSDS sheets will be provided.<BR><BR>Task 2: Spray weeds: The Contractor shall spray a DOD approved herbicide at the maximum permitted rate according to label directions, to control Musk (Carduus nutans), Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) and Elm (Ulmus spp.) so that the population is visibly reduced by at least 80 percent. Applications must be in conformance with state, federal, and DOD laws and regulations. Spraying must be completed  by June 15, 2009. The Contractor must coordinate application dates with the 88th RSCs Pest Management Coordinator (PMC) so that the PMC is available to evaluate quality assurance by observing chemical mixing and application. <BR><BR>Task 3: Mow weeds and elms saplings: The Contractor shall mow or shred areas that are densely vegetated no earlier than September 1, 2009. Mowing should be completed by October 15, 2009. These areas will have been treated in Task 1 by the Contractor. Areas needing mowing will include areas with excessive vegetation that will limit the effectiveness of additional herbicide applications.<BR><BR>Optional Tasks:  The Contractor shall spray and shred the following year to areas with new growth due to longevity of seed already present in the soil, if this option is exercised.  The POP for the option year would be 1 June 2010 to 31 Dec 2010.  <BR><BR>Methods: The Contractor shall within fifteen (15) day prior to the contract award, provide a written plan of control for species in this SOW. The 88th RSC is aware of equipment that can combine Tasks 2 and 3. If a Contractor has such equipment we encourage them to include this in their plan of control. All herbicides used by the Contractor shall be registered with the EPA and the applicable state lead agency for the intended use. The herbicides must also be approved by DOD for application in the proposed use. For each proposed herbicide, the product label and Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) days prior to the contract start date.  Any changes in approved herbicides shall be submitted for approval at least five (5) working days in advance of the anticipated use. Herbicide applications are not to occur if a precipitation event is forecasted before the herbicide can become rainfast or temperatures are cold enough such that the effectiveness of the herbicide is reduced. The Contractor must coordinate application dates with the 88th RSCs Pest Management Coordinator (PMC) so that the PMC is available to evaluate quality assurance by observing chemical mixing and application. The PMC has the authority to stop an application if the health and safety of the environment or personnel is jeopardized. <BR><BR>Technical Requirements: The Contractor must use a boom sprayer similar to those used in local agricultural practices. The Contractor may also need a sprayer that will allow herbicide application within tree and fence rows. The Contractor may be required to treat weeds within or near wetlands and will require an herbicide labeled for use within wetlands. These herbicides will be included in the written plan with the other herbicides that are to be approved in writing by the 88th RSC. The Contractor may be required to make spot treatments within open fields. All chemical application equipment must be calibrated to apply at the desired rates. The Contractor must be able to demonstrate that the equipment is calibrated. The Contractor will need a heavy duty PTO driven shredder that is capable of mowing dense stands of mature thistle and elm saplings that have a circumference less than 2 inches.<BR><BR>Deliverables: The Contractor shall submit a written plan of control methods that will include all the herbicides, adjutants, and/or oils to be used and rate of application for this SOW. The 88th RSC will review and approve or revise the plan. This written plan must be approved in writing before the Contractor will be authorized to proceed. The Contractor must communicate his intentions early to facilitate the approval. The Contractor shall maintain daily records of all herbicide usage on the Army Reserve Pest Management Report Record Form (see Appendix 3).  This form shall be filled out daily as weed control operations are performed, and all entries must be completed within 24 hours of chemical application.  Completed forms shall be made available upon request for inspection, and shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer with the invoice.  A copy will also be provided to the Pest Management Coordinator (PMC). An aerial photograph will be delivered that indicates the areas where herbicide was applied. Additionally the PMC needs a copy of the pesticide applicators license, product label and MSDS for each chemical used. This can be sent electronically or hard copy. Hard copies will be printed on 30% post consumer recycled paper in compliance with EO 13101 and Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines. Forms which are rejected by the Contracting Officer due to improper preparation shall be corrected and resubmitted by the Contractor at no additional cost to the Government.  Blank forms will be provided by the Government.<BR><BR>Schedule: The following schedule for completion of work was developed from time allocations in this SOW. The schedule below is an estimate, and will be modified based upon seasonal and training constraints.<BR><BR>Notice to Proceed (NTP):  To Be Determined<BR><BR>Kick-off Meeting, Submit written plan of control, Submit Pesticide Applicators License, <BR>Product Label, MSDS:  Within 15 days of NTP<BR><BR>88th RSC Review & Approve written plan of control: Within 20 days of NTP<BR><BR>Completed Spraying: 15 June 2009<BR><BR>Pest Record Form and Aerial Photo: Within 10 days of Completed Spraying<BR><BR>Completed Mowing: October 15, 2009<BR><BR>Optional Tasks: To Be Determined<BR><BR>Period of Performance: All tasks should be completed within 180 days of NTP, with possible exception of the optional tasks.<BR><BR>Place of Performance: The tasks will be completed on Mead LTA at locations indicated on aerial photos (See Appendix 1-2).<BR><BR>Reporting Requirements: The Contractor is to call the COR within 15 days of NTP.

(Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number.

Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. 
(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

HSAR 3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.  The program will seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p><strong>VENDOR QUESTION:&nbsp; </strong>In the Minimum Specs document, under Section 4.0 - Security, the Government requires:</p>
<p>"The device must have the ability to lock the control panel via strong password, to prevent changing the configuration via the control panel."</p>
<p>Does this refer to a password that is entered by users at their workstation or at the printer itself?</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp; The intent is for the technician that sets up the printer to be able to lock the control panel of the printer from the control panel while at the printer so that printer users can't go in and reconfigure the printer settings.</p>

<CONTACT>David T Reindl, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-842-6515, Fax 202-312-2792, Email d-reindl@nga.gov
<DESC>The National Gallery of Art (hereinafter "Gallery" or "NGA") is soliciting quotes for the purchase of a custom-built DVD/BluRay disk duplicating system ("Duplicator").  The Gallery seeks a proposed solution to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  The Gallery, being a repository of archival media as is the case with many museums, is often called upon to provide access to archived content for public support, educational programming, and scholarly research.  Therefore, there is frequent need for disc duplication in CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray formats, and to accurately reproduce audio, video, imaging, and data file content.

The minimum technical requirements for the Duplicator are:
 Five (5) target burner;
 Minimum 500GB hard drive with computer-grade power supply;
 Free firmware updates available by email, throughout the life of the product;
 Duplication of at least the following standards/zones: CDR, DC-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD D/L, BRD, BRD D-L, BRD-RW, BRD+RW;
 Toll-free tech support and component warranties for at least six (6) months; and
 One (1) Printer and at least two (2) cartridges for printing labels (printer shall print directly onto the disk - not on independent adhesive labels).
By submitting a quote, vendor certifies that the Duplicator quoted satisfies the above minimum requirements.

Optional features and additional information required to be provided in Vendor's quote:
 Vendor must provide a statement demonstrating responsiveness to firmware updates and quick relay of them to the NGA (I.e. How frequently/quickly will vendor provide updates to the NGA?);
 Provide a list of any additional standards/zones of media that are duplicable, in addition to the minimum types identified above;
 Provide information on any extended warranty/support available for the Duplicator in addition to the minimum six (6) months required;
 Provide a statement describing the speed and efficiency of the duplication process with the build that is quoted, as well as any available options for speed-increasing capabilities; and
 Identify any additional features provided with the quoted Duplicator. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.

The solicitation documentation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31. FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212, Evaluation-Commercial Items, is applicable to this acquisition. In addition to Price, the following Technical Factors will be used in evaluating quotes, listed in increasing order of importance: (1) Vendor's Prior Experience and (2) Ability to Provide Maximum Features.  Technical factors will be weighted slightly heavier than price. The vendor submitting (hereinafter the "Vendor) a quote is responsible for providing information in its quote sufficient to allow the Gallery to evaluate the quote using these evaluation factors. Vendors must submit a Firm-Fixed Price, including a breakdown of pricing that, at a minimum, delineates the price for the duplicator with all minimum requirements, with options priced separately.  Vendor shall provide technical documentation for all major components included in the quoted Duplicator.  Furthermore, Vendor shall provide an explanation of why the proposed combination of components would benefit the NGA and provide the NGA with the best value over a different combination of components.  The NGA may use this information in its technical evaluation of proposals.  Vendor shall also provide at least three examples of prior experience building similar custom systems for other clients.  The NGA will give preference to experience building similar systems for gallerys, museums, cultural institutions, or government agencies.  Pricing information shall be submitted separate from the technical information requested above.

The NGA intends to award a contract to the Vendor whose quote, in its entirety, demonstrates that the Vendor will provide the best value to the NGA.  An award may be made to a Vendor whose quote does not represent the lowest price or the highest technical score. The National Gallery of Art seeks proposed solutions to their need for duplicating disc-based media in a wide range of formats, and containing content of internal, outside, and international origin.  Vendors are also advised that a contract award may be made without discussion or negotiation, so vendors are encouraged to submit their best value quote. 

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition, which incorporates by reference, the following FAR clauses: 52.203-6 Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (Alt 1, OCT 1995); 52.219-8. By submitting a quote in response to this RFQ, the vendor warrants that any goods or services provided to the Gallery in satisfaction of this requirement are fit for the ordinary purposes for which they were designed, as well as the particular purpose(s) specified in the this solicitation, and any additional purposes as represented by the vendor. 

This procurement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) Business Size Standards for the NAICS code indicated in this synopsis applies.

<DESC>TENNIS SHOE HSCG23-09-R-PPH001/AMENDMENT 01

The purpose of this amendment is to extend the time for proposal and PDM submittals and revise requirements.  Accordingly, the shoe weight was understated so there were no vendors meeting all requirements of the solicitation.  Please take note of all changes to the solicitation listed below:

1)  The deadline for proposal and PDM submittals is extended to 2 pm local time, 28 May 2009.

2)  A revised Purchase Description (PD) dated 18 May 2009 replaces the previous PD dated 21 April 2009.  Your attentions are specifically invited to the revised weight requirements for the running shoe.  

3)  Previous offers that submitted proposals and PDMs under the original solicitation may or may not submit new packages.  

4)  Due to time restraints, offerors are not required to submit products with Logos at this time, but CG Logos will be required at First Article Test.  Those not submitting products with Logos shall provide adequate details demonstrating their use of the technique that will be used to produce the logo and any other samples or details of their ability to accomplish this task.

5)  Offerors not submitting the correct PDM quantities, sizes and other proposal requirements will be considered non compliant and will not be evaluated for award consideration.

6)  All other solicitation requirements will remain the same.

Note 7:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  
(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the salient characteristics of the description/specification; pass the Shock Attenuation Test and Forefoot Flexibility Test and visual examinations.

2)  PAST PEFORMANCE  will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 7,500 pairs for each of the five (5) years.  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Both factors mentioned above are of equal importance and both factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 08-03-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 by 23 June 2008; FY 09 by 31 December 2008; FY 10 by 31 December 2009 and, FY 11 by 31 December 2010. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 March 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/RI, in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is soliciting white papers for a new research program with the title, the Software Systems Stockroom (S3).</p>
<p>The increased complexity and diversity of computational devices and systems is reflected in a corresponding increase in the difficulty in developing software for these systems. These difficulties are compounded by the dramatic increases in scale and scope of information processing applications due to the availability of networked heterogeneous distributed systems. All of these effects have exacerbated the challenges that engineers face in trying to specify, design, build, verify and test software. A number of codified approaches are available that utilize a technological framework for defining systems, expressing requirements, classifying components (meant throughout this announcement in the generic sense of constituent parts, which includes, but is not limited to, deployable components, classes, objects, modules, actors, and agents), validating systems and their components, and disseminating the results. However, these approaches have demonstrated point solutions with a limited ability to mitigate risks with limited success.</p>
<p>Complexity and diversity in computational systems is an issue in information technology in general, but the unique combination of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability, and real-time operation requirements that military systems must satisfy set them sharply apart from non-military applications. To successfully mitigate risks, approaches require community involvement, and a social framework for participation, discussion and a means for gaining community approval of new technologies. Solutions to the increased complexity and diversity of computational devices and systems require a sustained commitment by the community to devise technologies that can be used for system design and the development of general use tools. A software library is such a tool that is used to help develop applications by providing services and offering modularity, portability and efficiency of the code. Libraries follow the principles of encapsulation and separation of concerns allowing programmers to add functionality. Such tools strive to reduce complexity by providing a shared common resource, with a shared vocabulary, a shared understanding, and a shared culture of its use. Furthermore, libraries can become an authoritative and trusted reference for software system development with the right framework and smart dedicated community effort.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>This BAA seeks to improve the capability to produce software for DoD systems by encouraging the capture and reuse of domain knowledge and expertise through an open, community-driven, technically focused shared infrastructure. A proposed infrastructure must build on sound principles of computer science, best practices of software engineering, and robust capture mechanisms (e.g. abstractions, libraries, architectures, patterns, etc.).</p>
<p>White papers are being solicited for demonstrating and filling capture mechanisms of the infrastructure with knowledge and expertise applicable to one or more domains of interest to DoD. Proposed efforts should align with a set of software and systems developers motivated to employ those mechanisms and show clear reduction in software and systems development costs for DoD warfighting systems. These capture mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, ontologies and metadata, digital libraries, and software/system tools. Of interest are approaches that focus on specific domains, but have the potential for expansion to other domains, support collaboration, encourage community-development, build upon open frameworks, and have a clear path to industrial acceptance.</p>
<p>Initial investments will be through small, focused technical implementations with a targeted user base of software and systems developers working on software and systems deployed by the DoD for the warfighter. To achieve the objectives, the proposed activities will likely require a team, consortium, or active community of interest to enable dissemination and use of the research products. Offerors should clearly identify the specific technical niche (e.g., signal processing, vehicle management systems, weapons control mode executives, avionics), specific infrastructure technologies employed (e.g., reuse libraries, abstraction tools, design pattern capture), how the implementations, once matured, will be employed by systems developers, and motivating forces (economic, technical, competitive) that drive the community of systems developers to benefit from and support the investment proposed. Extension of the technologies and techniques employed to other DoD interest areas and communities should also be addressed.</p>
<p>The intent of this solicitation is not generic reuse frameworks, or technologies solely addressing networking or communications challenges.</p>
<p><br />Research Concentration Areas:</p>
<p>Should include but not be limited to:</p>
<p>Community and Technical Specialization. The S3 should focus on a technical area for which there is an active research and applications community, supportive of systematic standardization and codification of tools, techniques and practices at the component level. A plan to engage and involve a wider community including industry, government, and academia must be provided.</p>
<p>Classifications and Taxonomies. Innovative approaches are sought for describing software systems components, their interrelationships, functional and non-functional dependencies, the construction environment, and that address complexity, derivations, invariants, signatures, provenance, traceability, provability, and attestations. The taxonomies devised should facilitate understanding and classifying behaviors and properties that arise from combining components. Of particular interest are systematic correct-by-construction derivations of components for classification and taxonomic structure.</p>
<p>Information Provenance and Intellectual Property. The open framework should support laws and policies governing the use of digital intellectual property of data, software, systems and their derivations as transparently as possible for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Architecture. The architectural definition should provide the ability to understand and control those elements of the design that capture the utility, cost and risks. The definition shall provide a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions, and interfaces. In addition, an extended architecture should provide a structured framework for such items as accounts of success and failures, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results from assessments of usage, and forensic studies of software disasters that help define problems and basic research areas.</p>
<p>User Interface and Usability. The style of interfaces that S3 presents to its users affects overall usability. Scenarios that illustrate the salient features and their use should be provided in a storyboard style.</p>
<p>Technology Diffusion and the Developer Community. A plan to involve the community of developers must be provided. The plan should promote principles of interoperability, transparency, and accountability, encourage the use of the open framework and its resources, and engage vendors.</p>
<p>Collaboration. Teaming, joint projects, and in-kind cooperation are encouraged especially when competing commercial interests find common ground to address DoD and community-wide needs.</p>
<p>Content and Experimental Prototype. An S3 prototype with content provided by the research community of concern must be constructed as part of an empirical assessment of the feasibility and viability of the proposed S3 system.</p>
<p>Metrics. The major characteristics of the S3 and its usage are to be assessed and, where possible, measured among others for accuracy, consistency, completeness, organization, transparency, trustedness, and usability.</p>
<p>International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export control issues. These laws are to be enforced in the S3 at all times when sensitive material is involved.</p>
<p>References: <br />Under another Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI) effort, the Systems and Software Producibility Collaboration and Evaluation Environment (SPRUCE) seeks to provide an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and run-time technologies to yield more predictable production of software intensive systems. SPRUCE is a resource available for leverage if needed.</p>
<p>For details on SPRUCE, please see:<br />https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=e7730ae5bd7d600c44290fea433390d9&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</p>

<p><br />Program Phases:</p>
<p>This program will use a competitive prototyping model. Under this strategy, funding will be provided for two or more competing teams for six months to produce a prototype and documentation. The development and operation phase will follow the down select. <br />The prototyping phase will consist of defining, developing, populating, and documenting the software development infrastructure and its context of employment. This phase will develop, populate, and document the prototype. The documents should describe among other things the characteristics of the proposed infrastructure from the users' viewpoint. It should also include defining, developing and documenting community of interest, tools, fundamental principles for organizing knowledge, any supporting architectures, as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing the design and evolution of the Stockroom. The resulting documentation should be written to communicate the overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to the user, developer, stakeholders and other organizational elements. It should describe the problem, targeted community, commercial partners, an open system framework, operational policies, interactions, and organizational objectives from an integrated systems point of view. <br />These initial concepts will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry, and Academia; therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with this requirement. After the down select will be the development and operation phase.</p>
<p>Anticipated Schedule for Phase 1 Activities:</p>
<p>The prototyping phase will begin with a kickoff workshop and proceed with a several month infrastructure definition and development of the S3 prototype. A review workshop will be held mid-way through the first phase during which the initial concepts will be briefed to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia who have been invited to review the ideas and provide feedback. The final months should be devoted to completing the initial concepts, the prototype, and incorporating comments from the review workshop. A final review workshop will be held in the last month, at which time the final concepts, documentation, and prototypes will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.</p>
<p>Awardees will be required to present the full extent of their work at both a mid-term and a final workshop, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>

<p>5. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to:</p>
<p>Steven.Drager@rl.af.mil<br />Attn: Mr. Steven Drager</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and carefully developed. Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence, creativity, and innovation of the development and the usability of the proposed technology, which include the architecture, the knowledge and expertise it captures, interoperability, and methodology to broaden participation of the technical community. <br />(2) Collaboration and Information Sharing. The offeror must demonstrate a high level of commitment with detailed plans for collaboration among all major relevant parties. That is, the offeror must provide plans for sharing results with the broader community and encouraging participating of team and non-team members alike in evaluations and information dissemination.<br />(3) Related Experience. The white paper will be judged on the extent to which the offeror demonstrates technical knowledge and competency in relevant domains of software technologies, balance of the skills set of the team, excellence of the academic-industry team members, experience with government contracts, and proven capability to conduct innovative practical research. Of particular importance is acumen in the unique challenges of integration and development, anticipated in the near to far term.<br />(4) Openness and Maturity of Solution. - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and previous demonstration of capability to accomplish the proposed tasks.<br />(5) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers or proposals. Individual white papers and proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>Awardee will have to present the full extent of its work at a workshops, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees. Therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with these requirements.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. <br /><br />2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection. ARDA and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that offerors selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies. Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access. In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Offerors desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.</p>
<p>It should be noted that CASE is not intended as a solely classified effort, and that there is a wide range of research that can be done at an unclassified level. Offerors should make it clear in their white papers and proposals which aspects of their work, if any, will be at the classified level. While it is possible to execute an entire research program on the unclassified level, having key personnel with Top Secret DoD clearance will enable the program to have greater access to the real needs of analysts, thereby increasing the chances of successful research.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: For proposals selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY. Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VIII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below (Email submissions preferred):</p>
<p>Edward Depalma<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3069<br />Email: Edward.Depalma@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>Questions of a contractual/business nature shall be directed to the cognizant contracting officer, as specified below:</p>

<a href="mailto:david.gregorovic@wpafb.af.mil;">david.gregorovic@wpafb.af.mil;</a>
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):  Health & Usage Monitoring System for MQ-9

Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct Market Research which will be used to develop program plans and an acquisition strategy for a Health and Usage Monitoring System for the MQ-9 Reaper Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to provide reliable in-flight, real-time diagnostic and prognostic analysis of aircraft systems to enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and improved mission reliability.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred responding to this RFI.
The MQ-9 Program is attempting to determine if sources are available in the near-term to meet the requirements as stated below for a Health and Usage Monitoring System that enables Condition Based Maintenance and improved mission reliability.  A key focus of this RFI will be on determining if there are suppliers with production systems readily available for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) applications that can be integrated into the MQ-9 fleet.   The purpose of this effort is to identify suppliers that have developed, integrated, tested, and fielded Health and Usage Monitoring systems for commercial and military aircraft applications for possible integration and incorporation into the MQ-9.  
Sources Sought:  The objective of this RFI is to identify potential health and usage monitoring systems that provide the required operational and maintenance benefits to the MQ-9 program in a readily available timeframe.  Emphasis on production ready hardware integrated on military aircraft is of special interest.  Since this is a market research activity at this time only, general program and technical information on the respondent's system is only required in response to this RFI. Requirements Guidelines:  The primary objective of a Health and Usage Monitoring System for the MQ-9 is to improve flight safety, mission reliability and effectiveness, as well as increases fleet operational readiness while reducing fleet operating and maintenance costs.  The goal is a Condition Based Maintenance capability.  In order to meet the stated objectives, the Health and Usage Monitoring System for the MQ-9 should include these key capabilities:
.	Reliable in-flight, real-time automatic diagnostic and predictive failure /prognostic analysis capability.  The MQ-9 currently utilizes a Data Logger/Signal Plotter Program for post mishap analysis that provides no provisions for control, health monitoring, diagnostic or prognostic analysis.     .	User-friendly interface for operator, maintenance and ground personnel for advisory, data monitoring, analysis, and reporting. .	Readily available for integration into the MQ-9.  Previous integration into other military aircraft of production systems is of particular interest.
Operational Requirements:  The on-board health and usage monitoring system must be able to meet the environmental conditions and operating environment of the MQ-9.  The MQ-9 is a medium-altitude, high endurance aircraft powered by a turbo-prop engine.  The aircraft can support the standard industry communication interfaces. 
Due Date:  Packages shall be mailed to the undersigned and received no later than 19 June 09.

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp. All contractors interested in receiving information on this acquisition are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps website as well as the AFCEE ECOS09 website listed above. Note: Only small business firms can register on the ECOS09 website as interested primes.</p>
<p>No hard copies of this solicitation will be issued. All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address.

<DESC><p>This is the fourth amendment to the original presolicitation notice for Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 posted on 24 November 2008 and the first amendment to the RFP released on 29 April 2009. The purpose of this notice is to announce Amendment 1 to the RFP. Amendment 1 is identified as FA8807-09-R-0003 0001. The details of Amendment 1 are attached to this announcement. In addition, this announcement includes Attachment 13 System Modifications which was inadvertently missing from the notice of RFP release. Although Attachment 13 must be included as part of the proposal, it does not require Offeror input. See RFP Section L-9.9.14 for instructions regarding Attachment 13. This amendment to the presolicitation notice corrects the response time indicated in the previous announcement. In accordance with Section L-2.1.a, proposals must be received by 1630 Pacific Daylight Time on 20 June 2009. Classified delivery shall be in accordance with Section L-2.1.b. This amendment to the presolicitation notice also changes the primary POC from Ms. Rachel Cavanna to Ms. Yvette Wilson.
<p>GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category ID program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1.0 and 2.0. Block 1.0 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1.0 capabilities, Block 2.0 will integrate GPS IIIA satellite capabilities into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C), on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Proposals are due 20 June 2009 as stated in Section L of the RFP.<br /><br />BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.</p>
<p>The DoD mandates the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than a username and password, before granting access.</p>
<p>In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the aforementioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components:</p>
<p>(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software.</p>
<p>(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate<br />http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html</p>
<p>This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and FAR 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), GPSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>
<p>Federally Funded Research and Development Centers may provide unique capabilities that an offeror may want to utilize. Part 35.017 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations provides the policy and process to obtain such services.</p>

<p>8. Description: National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey 2012<br />The United States Department of Education has a requirement for a large, complex data collection that assesses how students and their parents pay for college. The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey 2012 solicitation by June 8, 2009. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is designed to collect information on a nationally representative sample of students attending postsecondary institutions. The study provides information about the costs of postsecondary education and how students and their families meet these costs. Contract options include: conducting the full-scale study in 2011 instead of 2012 (Option 1); state-representative samples of students enrolled at public 2-year, public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and for-profit institutions (Option 2); supplementing the sample size and questionnaire content to meet specific policy interests (Options 3 and 4, respectively); examining the effectiveness of offering incentives to increase participation of sampled students and postsecondary institutions (Options 5); identifying and following-up first-time beginning postsecondary students in the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal studies of 2014 and 2017 and identified as BPS:12/14 and BPS:12/17 (Options 6 and 7, respectively); collecting high school transcript data during BPS:12/14 (Option 8); collecting postsecondary transcript data during BPS:12/17 (Option 9); collecting financial aid data from institutions students attended in 2011-2014 as part of BPS:12/14 (Option 10); collecting financial aid data from institutions students attended in 2014-2017 as part of BPS:12/17 (Option 11), and matching students that were in the BPS:04/06/09 cohort to various administrative databases in 2011 to see if anyone obtained degrees beyond BPS:04/09 (Option 12). Data will be collected primarily via the web and include self-administered, telephone interview, and fieldwork. Although different modes of collection are anticipated, the system will be web-based. This study will culminate in documented data files, electronic codebooks, data analysis systems, and tabulations/descriptive reports for the base contract and option(s).</p>

This is a sources sought notice.  This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to answer questions submitted for RFI # N65538-09-Q-0028.  The following questions and answers are provided:
1.  Will there be a separate Services (implementation and interfacing) contract let after the Software is purchased, or will the final solicitation have both Software and Services under one vehicle?
Answer:  The Government anticipates that the Software and Services will be purchased under one GSA Contract vehicle.
2.  Will there be any Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues with companies already performing under the SMLIS contract?  
Answer:  (a)  An analysis must be done by contractors of potential new work against all current and previous work performed in support of SMLIS in any category other than that of the new work being offered.  This analysis must be included in the quote for the new work, and must include a statement certifying whether the contractor believes that its performance of the proposed new work would create a real or apparent OCI.  If the contractor believes that no real or perceived OCI will result from an award of the proposed work, no additional action by the contractor is required.
	(b)  If the Offeror/Contractor believes that a real or apparent OCI may exist as a result of an award, the contractor shall also submit an OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan with its quote.

<DESC><p>Next Generation Mail Processing Technologies: The United States Postal Service (USPS) is initiating a new acquisition program entitled &ldquo;Next Generation Mail Processing Solution&rdquo; to identify participants and sources of supply, capable of providing research and development, design, and in or out sourced manufacturing for a new state-of-the-art, automated, mail processing design solution. This solution will be deployed to sort and sequence the high volume of letter and flat mail currently processed within USPS facilities nationwide. This market notice and supply chain opportunity is ultimately seeking suppliers who can offer new or not previously fielded concepts or variations of existing equipment, having an achievable maturation path leading to deployable equipment commencing within the next six years. This initial notice is providing for market research and publication of opportunity, with a following step of additional discussions related to supplier capabilities and qualifications for inclusion within a competitive process toward the above goal. Current Mail Processing Operational Information: Currently, the Postal Service processes approximately 550 million letter and flat mail pieces at 283 processing facilities each day. The USPS segregates letter and flat shaped mail as it enters processing, and this separation is maintained throughout the sorting process. Our existing automated process yields a high volume of sorted mail to a finite number of delivery points. Several high speed processing runs are performed each day to accommodate all delivery points within a single mail processing centers&rsquo; coverage area. Letter and flat mail is manually merged during the final processing operations by our street carriers for delivery to the addressee. NGMPS Program Objectives: The NGMPS Program Objective is to deploy a system solution which will be capable of efficiently, reliably and accurately delivery point sequencing both letter and flat mail simultaneously within a merged mail stream and within the same system. As space is a cost consideration for the USPS, the solution should utilize and accomplish this task within the smallest footprint possible. The required output of the system is a single, combined mail stream for letter and flat mail in delivery point sequence order. Designed solutions should consider the use of specifically designed letter and flat mail input subsystems, or use feeders currently deployed within the Postal Service. Deployment of equipment to individual delivery units is not desired and does not meet the Postal Service&rsquo;s future vision. Competitive factors for success will be sort and sequence accuracy, time to process, and the systems ability to support our established high standards of service for the American people. Additional factors are projected to be development cost to bring to market, system reliability, accept rate, labor cost to operate, and overall space required to accomplish the mission. Finally through NGMPS, the USPS seeks a system which can be deployed nationally and incrementally to provide maximum flexibility to delivery point sequence letter and flat shaped mail within existing and future Postal Service infrastructure. Future Mail Trend Impact on NGMPS: Research indicates a shift in mailing trends propelled by the numerous means of communication options available to business and consumers today. These trends are characterized by slower mail volume growth and continued increases in the number of delivery points. As volume growth slows, emphasis must shift to accommodate more delivery points with less volume. A new solution with processing based upon the volume of mail available, with delivery points as the variable, would provide an opportunity to streamline operations. Processing letter and flat shaped mail on one system (using either a single induction feeder or multiple induction feeders to accommodate the varying mail shapes) would eliminate the manual merging process, improve efficiencies, and reduce costs. The most efficient processing scenario would be a one feed solution for letter and flat mail, independent of delivery points, limited only by a maximum volume, which would provide a merged letter and flat mail product in delivery point order. The NGMPS Program is seeking such a solution. NGMPS Acquisition Approach: The Postal Service will provide for a supplier prequalification and competitive process through identified Phases leading to test and production deployment. The Postal Service is reviewing alternative approaches to ensure that it provides for selection of a best value solution which ensures supply base availability to support future deployment phases, quantity acquisitions, and system upgrades. Suppliers interested in responding to this announcement wishing to participate in this program should send their contact information to Ms. Tammi Robinson-Minor, Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist, United States Postal Service, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22082-8150. Email address is tammi.robinson-minor@usps.gov. Telephone: (703) 280-7885. Telephone inquires and questions will be addressed, however, for action concerning participation, inquiries must be in writing. Suppliers should provide for notification of interest as soon as practicable, and in no event later than December 15, 2008. Upon required written notification of interest, the USPS will provide additional information for supplier response within a prequalification process, with successful suppliers moving forward to Request for Proposal (RFP) participation. NGMPS Phase I Acquisition Schedule/Time Line: It is envisioned that development and deployment of the NGMPS will be contracted for in phases. Phase I will include a study, concept design, and simulation deliverable. Simulation analysis is critical in demonstrating the potential USPS return on investment of the developed concept to substantially and positively impact USPS infrastructure in mail processing, transportation, logistic and delivery operations. Phase II is planned as an equipment build and component test phase, with participation planned for those suppliers, and their manufacturing source if applicable, who submitted concept designs and simulations which were considered by the Postal Service as best value in the ability of the design concept to meet operational needs. Phase II will be divided into subsequent &ldquo;equipment build&rdquo; phases, which might include major component bread board, prototype, or pre-production phases depending upon the maturation level of the proposed solution. It is anticipated that the USPS will issue a Statement of Objectives (SOO) to pre-qualified sources in January 2009, and that contracts for Phase I as described would be awarded no later than April 2009. A subsequent announcement prior to RFP issuance in January will identify all pre-qualified participants. This announcement of program initiation does not in any way commit the USPS to contract, test, or purchase any equipment or make any award as a result of this publication and notice.</p>

<p>Attached to this notice is the Pre-Qualification Package for the Next Generation Mail Processing System (NGMPS) program. The package contains instructions for preparing and submitting a pre-qualification statement. Interested suppliers must follow the instructions to be considered for pre-qualification.</p>
<p>The due date for the submission of supplier's&nbsp;Pre-Qualification Statements has been extended to COB, Friday, January 16, 2009.</p>

<DESC>Action Code: Presolicitation Notice<BR>Classification Code: A<BR>Subject: AERDC Broad Agency Announcement Additional Energy-Related Topics Solicitation Number: W912HZ-09-BAA03<BR>Set Aside Code: UP (unrestricted)<BR>Response Date: 02282010<BR>Place of Performance: To Be Determined<BR>Description: <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for various research and development topic areas. This notice is to identify additional areas of interest to the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Facilities Division, under Topics CERL 4 and CERL 7. As a result the following topics are added:<BR><BR>D.1. Energy Security Assessments and Islanding Methodologies (CERL 4 -1)<BR><BR>1. OBJECTIVE: <BR><BR>Installation energy security consists of the capacity to avoid adverse impact of critical missions caused either by natural, accidental, or intentional events adversely affecting Army installation energy and utility supply and their respective distribution systems.  Energy and utility supply and their distribution systems include electricity, natural gas, steam, liquid fuel, water, and others.  While all Army installations are required to maintain individual energy security plans (e.g. Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 86-2), little guidance is available as to how the installations should perform their own energy security assessments.  Further, recent Defense Science Board (DSB) findings point to installation missions being vulnerable to the fragility of the commercial electric grid, leading to a recommendation to develop the capability to island critical missions from the commercial electric grid for up to six months in duration. <BR><BR>2. DESCRIPTION:  <BR><BR>a. Focus. This topic focuses on advanced research and development for energy security at Army installations.  Proposals are sought for the development and execution of the following:: <BR>(1) develop installation energy security self-audit methodologies and models, including energy security metrics for critical missions. Proposals are encouraged to include methodologies, standards and procedures, such as <BR>		(A) energy security survey methodologies,<BR> 		(B) standards for utility systems and energy supply reliability, <BR> 		(C) facilities prioritization methodologies,<BR>(D) coordination with resident anti terrorism / force protection (AT/FP) offices and procedures, and <BR>(E) economic impact methodologies for various energy interruption scenarios.  <BR>(2) validate the energy security self-audit models at up to sixteen (16) force projection installations based on the methodologies and models developed in (1) above, <BR>(3) demonstrate the capability of the methodologies and models of (1) above at up to sixteen (16) force projection installations in (2) above to project lists of actionable items to consider for implementation toward improving energy security, and <BR>(4) develop methodologies and  strategies to island the critical missions from the commercial electric grid for a six (6) month period.  <BR><BR>b. Special Considerations.  Special attention shall be paid to the following:<BR><BR>Level of understanding of energy security methodologies and assessment techniques required for a campus of various buildings, interconnected utility systems, and diverse missions.<BR><BR><BR>(Contact: Frank Holcomb, 217-373-5864, Email: franklin.h.holcomb@usace.army.mil)<BR><BR><BR>D.2. Ultra Low Energy Community Systems (CERL 4-2)<BR><BR><BR>1. OBJECTIVE: <BR><BR>Energy efficiency and energy security are of growing importance for the Army and the nation.  To reduce the economic burden for obtaining these goals, alternatives are sought to existing practices and technologies used in retrofitting projects by utilizing all waste streams and low energy approaches in combination with using renewable energies.  Greater cost effectiveness for energy retrofitting projects may be achieved by transitioning from the individual building approach to developing and implementing installation-wide energy master plans for ultra low energy communities. <BR><BR>Proposals are sought to develop concepts, methodologies, integrated technologies, and validations by modeling one or more Army installations within the context of Master Planning an orderly approach to changing the typical Army installation to an ultra low energy consuming community that achieves:  (1) Reduced energy wastes and greater use of energy conserving (ultra-low energy) technologies, (2) Maximized use of renewable energy technologies, and (3) Optimized Life-Cycle Cost.<BR><BR>Awardees should anticipate validating their most promising concepts at candidate installations such as Ft Irwin and Ft Carson.  Validation outcomes should focus on the ability to readily implement results at Army ultra low energy installations. <BR><BR><BR>2. DESCRIPTION:  <BR><BR>a. Focus. This topic focuses on advanced research and development for: (1) Energy models  providing an optimal selection of cost effective low energy technologies for a specific site with its unique weather, building/energy systems, energy costs, and occupancy demands; (2) Master Planning an orderly approach to changing a typical Army installation to an ultra low energy consuming community which includes consideration of interruptions and meeting the energy demands of Army operations during the  implementation of ultra-low energy technologies,  The orderly approach should also account for the use of land and space of a given installations long range master plan for growth and mission.<BR><BR>b. Special Considerations.  Special attention shall be paid to the following:<BR>i. Effectiveness of the models for selecting ultra-low energy technologies.<BR>ii. Design and construction requirements to install ultra-low energy technologies. <BR>iii. Optimized cost of selected ultra-low energy technologies. <BR><BR>(Contact: Alexander Zhivov, 217-373-4519, Email: Alexander.M.Zhivov@usace.army.mil)<BR><BR><BR>G.1. Microgrid Field-Scale Demonstration (CERL Topic 7-1)<BR><BR>1. OBJECTIVE: <BR><BR>Evolutionary changes in the regulatory and operational climate of traditional electric utilities and the emergence of smaller generating systems (greater than 5MW) have opened new opportunities for on-site power generation by electric power consumers.  Distributed energy resources (DER) have emerged as a promising option to meet growing customer needs for electric power, with an emphasis on flexibility, reliability, power quality and improved efficiencies.  The portfolio of DER includes advanced generators, micro-turbines, fuel cells, energy storage, renewable energy technologies, and smart loads.<BR><BR>The microgrid represents an entirely new approach to integrating DER.  Traditional approaches for integrating DER focus on the impacts on grid performance of one, two, or a relatively small number of sources and depends on the grid to provide voltage and frequency support.  Emergency back-up generation is an example of islanded generation using traditional approaches.  This is effective if the generator is never connected electrically to the grid or to other back-up generators.  Currently the use of multi-generators in an island operation requires a fast coordination controller to insure acceptable operation.  This greatly reduces the ability to add generation as needed, and loss of the controller results in loss of the generation.  The daunting challenge of building a microgrid with a large number of DER units requires a system of systems approach with extraordinary flexibility. Controls need to be fast and smart.  For major events such as loss of utility power or loss of a DER unit, the control response must be in milliseconds.  This level of response is achieved by each component of the microgrid using autonomous controls, based only on local information.  The longer time frame needs of the microgrid are provided by a distributed system controller, which optimizes the operation of each component of the microgrid, depending on mission.<BR><BR>Proposals are sought to develop, validate and demonstrate the microgrid concept, methodology, and technology integration, through modeling and simulation.  Validation of system performance of the resulting microgrid design may be performed via a field-scale demonstration at a subset of buildings that are part of the Field Artillery Training Center at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  The demonstration will determine the microgrids ability to quantifiably and optimally combine distributed energy technologies with other Distributed Generation (DG) sources in a seamless manner, for meeting the power and energy needs of all mission critical loads.<BR><BR>2. DESCRIPTION:<BR><BR>a. Focus. This topic focuses on advanced network science research and development resulting in: (1) developing decision architecture and system control models that integrate all DERs and loads on the microgrid, for both grid-connected and islanded operation, while maintaining grid stability in both modes; and (2) validating  the microgrid design improves energy system reliability and security, for meeting critical mission power and energy requirements in a long term sustainable environment.  Successful completion of this demonstration at Fort Sill is a major step toward enabling the Army to implement microgrid power architecture for deployed bases, as well.<BR><BR>b. Special Considerations.  Special attention shall be paid to the following:<BR>i.	Designing a control system to effectively manage and control energy and storage resources, to safely provide energy in a grid-connect mode that reduces grid energy demands, and to reduce operating costs during peak demand periods.<BR>ii.	Developing a control system architecture to effectively manage available energy and storage resources, to safely provide secure and highly reliable energy, and, to demonstrate environmental performance in an islanded mode for a period of 30 days.<BR>iii.	Evaluating the capability of the microgrid to be certifiable for purposes of environmental sustainability, energy safety, security, reliability, and cost elements for all operating modes.<BR><BR><BR>(Contact: Roch Ducey, 217-373-6760, Email: roch.ducey@us.army.mil)<BR><BR><BR>The BAA is available at http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/contract/docs/BAA.pdf and is open until superseded. Proposals may be accepted at any time. For questions concerning proposals to CERL, contact Andrea J. Krouse at 217-373-0000 or via email at  Andrea.J.Krouse@usace.army.mil or Rita S.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE:

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking Offerors to fulfill a requirement to purchase: (1) a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 95 (ATON) SKIFFS (AB-SKF),(2) a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 60 ATON PUNTS (AB-PNT) and (3) associated trailers and equipment in accordance with the attached specification. This solicitation is being issued under NAICS Code 336612 (size standard: 500 or fewer employees) as a 100% small business set-aside.

The AB-SKF will be deployed from Coast Guard cutters (ships) or Aids to Navigation Teams in support of mission activities, primarily, aid to navigation servicing, construction, repair and discrepancy response. The AB-SKF will be used to conduct specific aid to navigation recovery; such as, towing a buoy alongside the hull or wire dragging to locate a downed (sunk) object.  

The AB-PNT will be used by Construction Tenders to transport equipment to a construction site and also used at small boat stations for emergency response to floods or areas where a shallow water response is necessary.  

This procurement will be accomplished in three phases: (1) Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), (2) Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E), and (3) Full Rate Production (FRP).

The USCG intends to procure a minimum of 1 to 5 AB-SKF and a minimum of 1 to 3 AB-PNT for a LRIP run, necessary to field enough vessels to perform OT&E. The OT&E period will run for three months. During this OT&E period, the USCG will fully test the boats (and associated boat outfit and supporting equipment) in a variety of operational and geographic areas to ensure that they meet the performance criteria outlined in the specifications. By the end of this OT&E period, the Offeror(s) shall provide fully developed Logistics, Drawings, and other deliverables outlined in Sections 083-086 of the specification. Once the USCG has accepted and approved of these deliverables, the Offeror(s) will be authorized to proceed to a FRP of the remaining vessels, as outlined in the resulting contract(s) and delivery order(s). 

Offerors may propose on either both classes of boats or on one of either class of boats as the USCG anticipates awarding either a single Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract (for both classes of boats) or two Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contracts (one for Aids To Navigation (ATON) SKIFFS (AB-SKF) and one for ATON PUNTS (AB-PNT)). The initial delivery order (s) will be issued concurrently with the Requirements Contract. The period of performance shall be five years from the date of award. 

The following documents are included and are hereby incorporated into this solicitation: (A) Solicitation (Attachment A), (B) AB-SKF and AB-PNT Specification (Attachment B), (C) Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment C), (D) USCG Districts (For Delivery Purposes) (Attachment D), and (E) Price Scenario Worksheet (Attachment E).

Ports of Cartagena and Contecar Central Security and Customs Facility Feasibility Study.
The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the two ports.
The objective of this feasibility study in Colombia is to develop a central customs and security facility that will serve the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagenas (SPRC) Ports of Cartagena and Contecar, which are located 15 kilometers apart.  Over the past 13 years, SPRCs container traffic has multiplied seven-fold, and its facilities can handle over 1,000,000 TEUs and 600,000 tons of bulk cargo per year.  SPRC succeeded in obtaining a U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) designation for the Port of Cartagena. 
The Feasibility Study would support the development of a central customs and security system to serve these two ports operated by SPRC, and possibly other terminals in the area.   The project will supplement and expand container handling capacity at Cartagena and improve SPRCs competitive position.  SPRC intends to extend Cartagenas Terminal Operating System to the Port of Contecar by connecting the terminal security of the two operations with technology such as fiber optic cabling and wireless transmitters.
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks:
(1) review existing security and customs clearance systems, (2) identify and evaluate potential sites for the central security and customs facility, (3) interim presentation, (4) development and environmental impacts, (5) performance specifications and implementation plan, and (6) final report and presentation.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:
https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp
Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.
Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.
Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by
6:00PM local time, Monday, June 22, 2009
at the address above.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.
