<DESC>R- Historical Real-Time Transactions Price Data - U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), on the behalf of Bureau of Analysis (BEA) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with J.D. Power and Associates, 5435 Corporate Drive, Suite 300, Troy, MI 48098 for the award of a Contract under FAR part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This Acquisition for Other Than Full and Open Competition is pursuant to the authority permitted under Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 6.302-1 (1) and 41.U.S.C. 253(a)(1), “Only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.” 

Statement of Work

Section 1- Introduction/Background
BEA provides many economic measurements as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).  The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include gross domestic product (GDP), which is considered the most useful summary measure of the Nation’s production.  BEA, as one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to the public.

BEA collects source data from specific sectors of the economy.  The objective of this procurement is to obtain additional real-time transactions price data in order to improve the motor vehicles estimates by allowing for seasonal adjustment.

BEA is the Nation’s economic accountant, producing measures such as GDP, one of the most important statistical releases for its effect on financial markets.  It is important that BEA continuously strives to develop new and improved measures of motor vehicles estimates, which are major components of personal consumption expenditures and gross private domestic investment on the product side of the accounts.

Section 2- Statement of Objectives
The methodologies for estimates of cars and of light trucks in the NIPAs were historically different due to the lack of detailed price data for light trucks.  With the substantial growth of light truck purchases in the last three decades, the need for improved measures of motor vehicles became even more evident.  During the 1998 annual revision of the NIPAs, average list prices by nameplate that is based on representative list prices from the Automobile Invoice Service was used for the first time.  These data replaced the CPI and PPI that was used for extrapolating and interpolating consumer and business purchases of light trucks.  During the 2003 Comprehensive Revision, the methodology for estimates of light trucks was made more consistent with cars.  This was a major step in improving motor vehicles estimates.  The incorporation of real-time price data for new vehicles beginning in August of 2001 into the 2005 Annual Revision greatly improved the estimates.  To allow for seasonal adjustment of the data and to prepare for the 2008 comprehensive revision, three more years of historical data are needed.

Section 3—Technical Specifications and Deliverables
The procurement of detailed monthly real-time price data for motor vehicles is very important to the GDP estimates.  The data must be provided in a continuous time series.  Finally, the data must represent a significant share of the transactions in the major markets. 

Monthly Pricing Reports from August 1, 1998 to July 31, 2001.

1. The data coverage includes a large sample of franchised dealers (at least 1/3 of dealers for each nameplate per major market covered).  
2. Coverage must include major urban markets throughout the country such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
3. The data is based on electronic point-of-sale information.
4. The vendor will provide the following transactions-level data series by make, model, and model-year:
• New vehicle transactions price,
• New vehicle price less customer cash rebate 
• New vehicle cost (dealer cost), and
• Transactions count.

Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency’s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response; all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  In your response you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the agency not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the agency.  In accordance with FAR 5.204 a written affirmative response must be received no later than 10 days after the publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the address contained at the header via e-mail to Jean.Barrett@noaa.gov to the attention of G. Jean Barrett and use Reference# DG1321-06-RQ-0160(GJB). Note 22 apply with exception of 10 days.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 678th Armament Systems Squadron, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Systems Program Office, Eglin AFB FL, intends to award a sole source, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company, to develop an operational JDAM Maritime Advanced Moving Surface Target Engagement (AMSTE) capability.  This effort is in response to the warfighters’ need for near-term all-weather precision engagement of maneuvering maritime targets.  This effort includes the design, development, integration, and test of a weapon datalink radio integrated with standard JDAM GBU-31 guidance kits.  A subsequent limited production effort, to be awarded in the January 2008 timeframe through a contract modification or separate contract, will provide required assets to operationally field a JDAM Maritime AMSTE capability.  At this time we anticipate approximately 500 units.  The Boeing Company is the current JDAM prime contractor, and has sole responsibility for design and warranty of the JDAM weapon system.  Boeing is not required to furnish a technical data package to the Systems Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available.  The scope of this effort shall include design, development, integration, test, and qualification of an integrated JDAM Maritime AMSTE weapon datalink capability, including procurement of the test and integration hardware/software, weapon datalink components, and logistics planning support and analysis as well as a limited follow-on production effort of ~500 units.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government’s intention to pay for information solicited at this time.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Boeing is the only known company that currently meets the qualifications detailed above.

Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to Mr. Wesley Treadway, (850) 882-4261 ext 2711.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns relating to this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting points of contact listed below.  For any other concerns, interested parties may call the AAC Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph A. Lanni at (850) 882-0662, AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-207C3, Patuxent River, MD intends to hold an INDUSTRY DAY Conference.     
The goal of the conference will be to gather potential industry feedback in regards to the C/KC-130T Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.

The conference is scheduled to be held on 30 August 2006 at the J.T. Daugherty Conference Center, 22111 Three Notch Road, Lexington Park,  Maryland, 20653, 301-863-2637, from 0900 to 1600 (Eastern Standard Time).   Parties interested in attending the conference are encouraged to contact Ms. Jackie Mercer via e-mail Jackie.mercer@navy.mil and  Ms. Mary Ann Foran via e-mail Maryann.foran@navy.mil. All interested parties, please provide the following information: Organization name and address, primary POC, business size, location, company officers, phone/fax and e-mail of the primary POC, and if your interested as a Prime or Subcontractor.  Each company is limited to five personnel attending the conference. Vendors that RSVP prior to 25 August 2006 will be provided the opportunity to register for a one-on-one meeting with the program office limited to no more than 30 minutes. This is an opportunity for vendors to provide more information about their individual companies. There will be a conference fee of $10 per attendee to be paid at the door. 

THE INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED OR FOR ANY TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES.

(ix.)	FAR 52.212-2,  Evaluation -- Commercial Items,  applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference. The following paragraph (a) is substituted for paragraph (a) of that clause: (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).   The following factors shall be used to evaluated offers:  Personnel, Past Performance, and Price.   (i) Personnel Evaluation Factors 1.  Personnel with demonstrated experience in the Statement of Work areas. 2.  Quality of the education, technical expertise, knowledge, and experience of the proposed personnel? 3.  Demonstrated understanding of the SSP mission and extensive subject matter knowledge of current Science and Technology planning practices, proven credentials in SBIR planning as they relate to the Proposal Work Statement. 4.  Demonstrated knowledge of the Department of Defense SBIR programs as they relate to the Proposal Work Statement. 5.  Personnel proposed with the required security clearance level. (ii.) Past Performance Evaluation Factors The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the Offerors and their proposed major subcontractors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.  In conducting the performance risk evaluation, the Government may use data provided by the Offeror and data obtained from other sources it considers current and accurate.  At a minimum, the Government performance risk evaluation factor will consider the Offeror’s record for on-time deliveries, technical quality, and cost control.  As stated in paragraph 4, Part 3 Past Performance, paragraph (b) above, a list of three (3) orders, contracts, and/or subcontracts performed within the last three (3) years.  If a Offeror performed less than three (3) orders, contracts, and/or subcontracts within the last three (3) years, a list of those orders, contracts, and/or subcontracts should be provided.  Offerors that are newly formed entities without prio!  r Orders, contracts, and/or subcontracts should list orders, contracts, and/or subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.  Offerors with no past performance history shall not receive a favorable rating.  .  The evaluation will be consistent with DFARS 215.305(a)(2), i.e. will take into account the offeror’s past performance in complying with the clause at FAR 52.219-8, “Utilization of Small           Business Concerns.” (iv) Price Evaluation The Offeror’s submitted price is presumed to represent the Offeror’s best effort to respond to the RFQ.  Price may be a significant determining factor for award depending on the outcome of the Personnel and Past Performance evaluations.          Evaluation Summary The Personnel factor is more important than the Past Performance factor.  When Personnel and Past Performance factors are combined, they are significantly more important than the Price factor.  Also, to be eligible for award, the offeror must meet the following requirement: At the time of contract award, all personnel whom the offeror proposed to assign to the contract must have a security clearance of “SECRET” or higher. (x.)	An offeror must include in Part 1 of its proposal a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (with its Alternate I), and a completed copy of the provision at DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items.  An uncompleted copy of each provision can be found on the NECO web page at http://www.neco.navy.mil.   (xi.)

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis for services regarding:  Publish Manuscripts in Peer Reviewed Journals to Disseminate NCI Monograph Findings on Measurement of Health Disparities to Reach Various Constituencies with McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A2, Canada.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

To promote the development of research that will generate an evidence base for population-based health policy, work needs to be disseminated to a range of constituencies including health policy researchers and administrators, social epidemiologists focusing on health disparities and biostatisticians developing methods to measure cancer-related health disparities.  The purpose of this requirement is to have manuscripts published in 3 journals which are read by the groups already involved in these areas of research.  The three manuscripts will also serve to increase exposure for the NCI monographs.  Timely dissemination of this research is critical as decisions are currently underway regarding measurement procedures for Healthy People.  

McGill University is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because of their expertise and work with measures of social inequalities in health.  Researchers at McGill University have published two (2) NCI monographs with support from the Surveillance Research and Applied Research Programs in which the researchers at McGill University reviewed indices from a range of disciplines and applied them to the measurement of cancer-related health disparities.  In addition, McGill University presented indices not previously used to measure and examine questions related to monitoring these cancer disparities.  The focus of the work is on the application of these new measures of inequality, specifically in monitoring trends in  cancer related health disparities. In summary, the manuscripts that are to be produced, is part of the previous activity and has the potential to have major influences on how NCI measure cancer related health disparities.  Accurate measures and monitoring in turn will affect our ability to develop successful public health policy and priorities to eliminate health disparities related to cancer.  It is important to the NCI and the scientific community to continue this effort with McGill University.  Any efforts to identify the expertise required for this requirement through outside sources will pose substantial undo costs and time to the government.  McGill University is the only known contractor that can provide the expertise to continue with this effort.

Contractor shall prepare and publish three (3) manuscripts for publication in peer reviewed journals based on case studies developed for the monographs:  1) First manuscript shall include the properties of the measures discussed in these manuscripts. It will not be driven by the individual case studies rather the measures used in them; 2) Second manuscript shall include the trends and issues related to female reproductive cancers included in the second monograph and; 3) Third manuscript shall be a “think piece” which includes the summary of the principles and lessons learned from the previously funded work performed by McGill University that yielded 2 monographs.      

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on August 24, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Creating a New Measure of Cancer Related Health Disparities – “Target Oriented Disparity Index” (TODI) and Development of Health Disparities Data Processing Tool with McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A2, Canada.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The Healthy People 2010 goals include a number of indicators related to cancer mortality and morbidity, cancer screening, preventive interventions and risk factors.  In addition to achieving or surpassing Healthy People 2010 goals with respect to these indicators, it is of highest priority to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to eliminate health disparities among various subpopulations of the nation.

This requirement consists of two (2) projects:  1) Development of a recommended measure of health disparities that use “target levels” as a reference as laid out in HP 2010, so that this new measure of health disparity would be neutral in the face of declining health in a particular social group causing reductions in inequality. The working name for the measure will be the “Target Oriented Disparity Index,” or TODI. This would involve both theoretical and empirical developments that test TODI in various scenarios and against the measure Lynch and Harper have already examined theoretically and empirically in earlier work.  This will facilitate the use of this measure with several cancer outcomes and make the resulting measure more robust and 2) Develop a software application, as an extension of the NCI SEER*Stat that can calculate multiple measures of cancer related health disparities from the NCI SEER data.  Through the use of the NCI SEER*Prep, the resulting application will be able to be applied to other data sources as well.  

McGill University is the only source known to the NCI that have uniquely qualified researchers to carry out this effort.  Their expertise and previous work with the NCI regarding measures of social inequalities in health has resulted in the publication of two monographs in which they reviewed indices from a range of disciplines then applied them to the measurement of cancer related health disparities and emphasized the data analyses which contained ten (10) case studies.  The focus of the work is on the application of these new measures of inequality, specifically in monitoring trends in cancer related health disparities. It is important to the NCI and the scientific community to continue this effort with McGill University as it has a direct impact of the measures of social inequalities and cancer related health disparities.  Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through outside sources would pose substantial undo cost and time to the Government.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990 with size standard of $6.5M.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to News of Group, Inc., 23316 Redmond Falls City Road, Suite 594, Redmond, WA 98053-8376.  This purchase is to plan, construct, deliver and oversee the technical functions of an online community of practice tools.  This is to be accomplished by tailoring an existing set of online collaboration tools to the needs of the ECIB in order to produce a fully operational online community of learners project (COLP).
This will include, and is not limited to overall concept development of the community, production of the website for the community, assistance with seeding content and members, graphic design, and securing web server space and a website URL ending in “.gov”.  The contractor will also be responsible for federal website guideline compliance as indicated in the Scope of Work document. The specific tasks involved will be: review and evaluate with ECIB all aspects of the online community toolset for tailoring to ECIB needs; establish a work plan for completing project by October 2006 including strategies to seed the community, supply user-valuable information and exchange opportunities, and seed the COLP library; produce working COLP with content manager that enables ECIB to make text, information, and image changes to the website at anytime and remotely without use of programmers; ensure COLP supports NIH privacy and website policies for data collection, questionnaires, Section 508 access, .gov URL and federal website designations, does not use persistent cookies, and follows similar federal guidelines detailed in the Scope of Work document; ensure the COLP includes ability to add new groups of members to the community website in the future, as detailed in the Scope of Work; ensure the COLP functions as a contract database for NHGRI to contact all members and groups of members by geographic location, grade level teaching, NHGRI courses attended, etc as described in the sow; ensure the COLP includes unrestricted use of the Healia search mechanism (Healia.com) and that the use of the engine is not subject to renewal fees or limited aspect of use by NHGRI; communicate with ECIB on a bi-weekly basis as to project status; provide for ECIB review of the website and for changes that are required and determined in the review phase; provide ability to generate website statistics on usage patterns, non-functioning pages, and similar review parameters which result from initial review of online toolset with ECIB; provide eight (8) hours of programmer time for maintenance and ECIB changes per month for the first year of operation.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that News of Group is a recognized leader in design, individualization, and production of online communities of practice tools.  In 2005 they successfully developed a similar product for the National Cancer Institute of NIH.  Utilizing this model and tailoring it to fit the unique and specific needs of the COLP of NHGRI will be not only efficient but also cost effective.  The existing model already contains strict federal content, coding, design, and operational guidelines unique to NIH, thus providing a valuable federal resource.  An award to any other source would affect the Institutes anticipated outcome and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and adequacy of the proposed approach; 2) qualifications of personnel; and 3) past performance.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the Size Standard is $23.0M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Scope of Work  Transport NPS Fundamentals II Participants  Parts I & II Part I:  Transportation from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, Phoenix, Arizona to Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, Arizona and Return Background  The Horace M. Albright Training Center, located on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, offers introductory training to approximately 700 new employees annually.  A total of twenty-four (24) courses have been scheduled between October 16, 2006 and August 10, 2007.  Up to fifty-six (56) trainees are on site during a training cycle (i.e., two (2) courses that run concurrently).  Participants fly into Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and are transported to the Albright Training Center, returning to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport two (2) weeks later.  Currently, participants pick up rental vans at the airport and carpool to the Center, reversing the process once the class has ended.  This practice is not cost-effective.  This practice also puts employees at risk, as participants are already weary when they begin their four-hour drive to the Canyon, and may lack experience in driving larger vehicles or dealing with inclement weather typical of the Southwest (e.g., dust storms, monsoons, snow and ice).   Purpose This scope of work requests quotations for transporting participants from the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to the Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, and return, for up to twenty-four (24) courses.  Due to fiscal constraints, the course schedule may be reduced with minimal notice. The Contractor shall be notified no less than three (3) days prior to the beginning of the scheduled course.    Special Notes In effect, this contract allows the Albright Training Center to arrange transport on a class by class basis.  The Contractor should note, however, that the NPS has offered NO LESS THAN approximately seventeen (17) courses per year for the past three (3) years, and does expect to run a full 24-course schedule in the base year.   Specifications 1)	The schedule shall provide for two (2) pickup times at the airport, one at 1:00 p.m. and one at 4:00 p.m.  Pickups shall be made at each of the four Sky Harbor terminals.  For the return trip from the Albright Training Center to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, the Contractor shall schedule two pickup times at the Albright Training Center, one at 5:00 a.m. and one at 7:00 a.m.  There is only one pick-up point at the Center.  4)	A number of participants drive private vehicles to Albright, reducing the number of participants needing transportation from the Contractor.  The NPS shall supply an approximate number of riders three (3) days prior to the pick-up day.   5)	Buses (or vans) shall accommodate participants and their luggage.  Vehicles shall stop twice northbound and twice southbound.

This individual shall be stationed at the following address:   Horace M. Albright Training Center #1 Albright Ave.  P.O. Box 477 Grand Canyon, AZ  86023 Part II:  Two-day Field Trip Transportation Background  The Horace M. Albright Training Center, located on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, offers introductory training to approximately 700 new employees annually.  Up to fifty-six (56) trainees are on site during a training cycle (i.e., two (2) courses that run concurrently).  Each course includes a two-day field trip.  Field trips generally visit sites in the Flagstaff area, but may also range farther south. Currently, participants convoy in rental vans.  Possible complications include getting lost, experiencing mechanical failure, and delays due to traffic or weather.  This practice is not cost-effective.  It also puts employees at risk, as drivers may lack experience in driving larger vehicles or dealing with inclement weather typical of the Southwest (e.g., dust storms, monsoons, snow and ice).   Purpose This scope of work requests quotations for transporting participants from the Albright Training Center to designated points over the course of two (2) days, and returning them to the Center.  Field trips leave the Center around 8:00 a.m.; participants should be dropped off the following day at the Training Center at 4:00 p.m. It should be noted that due to fiscal constraints, the course schedule may be reduced with minimal notice.  Specifications 1)	Buses (or vans) shall accommodate participants and their luggage.   2)	The Contractor shall provide a point of contact and a contact number on travel days, including direct contact with the driver(s), to the COR.   Special Notes Curriculum changes occur approximately once each year.  In the past, such changes have included a shift in the timing of the field trips within the course schedule (i.e., from Thursday-Friday to Monday-Tuesday).  If such a change is contemplated, the Contractor shall be notified well in advance. The current schedule falls on Monday-Tuesday of the second week of the course.   Base Year Schedule (Part II) Pick-up at Albright Training Center AND	Drop-off the Albright Training Center  10/23/2006	10/24/2006 11/13/2006	11/14/2006 12/4/2006	12/5/2006 1/29/2007	1/30/2007 2/12/2007	2/13/2007 3/26/2007	3/27/2007 4/23/2007	4/24/2007 5/7/2007	                5/8/2007 6/11/2007	6/12/2007 6/25/2007	6/26/2007 7/23/2007	7/24/2007 8/6/2007	                8/7/2007 The Contractor shall strictly adhere to the schedule and shall notify the COR immediately should the driver of the vehicle be late, and provide the reason why the vehicle is late and when service is expected to resume/begin. NPS Role and Responsibilities The COR shall provide a list of riders two (2) days in advance of the pick-up date.  Contracting Officer Representative The COR is the Contractor's primary contact during the performance of the contract.  The COR will be identified by appointment letter upon award of this contract.  Vehicle Requirements The vehicle(s) provided shall be dependable, in good working condition as applicable, and capable of accommodating all participants and their luggage.   All vehicles used by the Contractor must be appropriately registered, licensed and insured as required by Federal, State and Local Government for the type of service to be performed. Driver Requirements A driver shall be assigned to the route and shall be licensed to operate a vehicle of this type specified herein in the state of Arizona. At all times during the performance of the contract and until completion of the performance period, the Contractor shall provide a driver who is competent, safe, and dependable. Downtime When any vehicle regularly used in the performance of this contract is out of service for any reason, the vehicle shall be replaced by the Contractor with a vehicle of the same or similar specifications as the inoperable vehicle.  Inoperative vehicles shall be replaced by the Contractor within a reasonable amount of time.  The vehicle will not be considered back in service until the Contractor officially notifies the COR.  If the Contractor fails to repair or replace the inoperative vehicle, the NPS, at its option, may elect to secure a replacement vehicle from other sources, without regard or consideration of the reasons that caused the downtime.  The Contractor will be assessed the cost incurred by the NPS in securing the replacement vehicle. The Contractor shall notify the COR by telephone of any breakdown and the estimated time in which a replacement vehicle will arrive.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the Landing Approach Navigation System portion of the Air Traffic Control Capability project for Kandahar APOD.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use basic (one step/one envelope) bidding procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this RFQ will be that bid which is compliant with the technical requirements and is the lowest price offered.

The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA procedure with the additional opportunity for the Nations in response to this Notification of Intent (NOI) to nominate bidders in addition to the companies identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 4.5 million Euros ($8.2 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-12077-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

KAF has been designated by SACEUR as an ISAF APON and thus should be capable of supporting military operations conducted by NATO assigned air/land forces. As Air Traffic Management (ATM) at KAF is transferred to NATO from US Central Command (USCENTCOM), NATO must provide their own ATC capability, compromising a tower, radar, and other navigation aids.  

The Landing Approach Navigation System will incorporate a Ground Control Approach (GCA) Radar System, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), a Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) and VHF/UHF direction finder.

The GCA Radar System should consist of a Precision Approach Radar (PAR), an Approach Surveillance Radar (ASR), and a Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). The ASR will provide an air picture around the airport out to a required radius. PAR will direct landing aircraft into the correct glide path. The procured radar hardware will be housed in shelters and radar consoles will be installed at the tower. The radar system will be equipped with emergency power supply generators. 

TACAN is one of the principal navigation aids for NATO military aircraft. It will provide a pilot with slant range from and bearing to a selected ground beacon (air/ground operation) or with range only from another aircraft (air-air TACAN operations).

A VHF/UHF direction finder will locate and indicate direction of an approaching or departing aircraft, when radar information is unavailable or ambiguous.  

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET.  

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be introduced by their National Delegations with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

In addition, personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 25 August 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: August 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: October 2006

<ARCHDATE>09222006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Clausen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source, non-commercial purchase order with the University of California - Davis (UCD) to apply satellite data for three-dimensional modeling of PM2.5 formation and transport in San Joaquin Valley, California.  Background:  In 2005 EPA formed the EPA-GEO (EPA-Group on Earth Observations) committee in response to the Strategic Plan for the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS) developed by the Interagency Working Group on Earth Observations (IWGEO) of the Committee on Environment and  Natural Resources (CENR). The IEOS Strategic Plan established a framework for U.S. agencies participating in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) to link observations to societal benefits through an international effort to share and integrate Earth observation data.  Though  research conducted under the EPA-GEO Advanced Monitoring Initiative (AMI), EPA is providing key demonstration projects to support the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System (IEOS) and the international Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The AMI projects are intended to  demonstrate how a new "system of systems" can fill data gaps and affect the strength of information used for decision-making. AMI projects are intended as test beds to improve environmental health decision-making in specific contexts (e.g., geographic locations, demographic groups, and economic  sectors) by advancing scientific understanding and showcasing approaches and outcomes suitable for broad EPA application (e.g., assessments, regulatory action, guidance, uncertainty, accountability, etc).   The AMI project "Application of satellite data for three-dimensional monitoring of PM2.5  formation and transport in San Joaquin Valley, California" has been approved for funding from the AMI. This project will address the high concentrations of PM2.5 in SJV that significantly affect the public, environmental, and economic health of the area. Currently, point measurements from  ground-based monitoring networks are used to validate model results, however these measurements are limited spatially. This proposal will integrate high resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD), lidar aerosol vertical profile, and ground-based  PM2.5 to derive surface PM2.5 measurements from MODIS AOD. This project will establish a three-dimensional PM2.5 data set for SJV, leading to more comprehensive model evaluation and information that may produce more effective, better targeted control strategies to reduce PM2.5. The project leads  are EPA Region 9 and EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD). Collaborators on this project include NASA Langley, University of Maryland-Baltimore County, and California Air Resources Board (CARB).  This project will be beneficial to the regulatory planning and technical community at the  district, state, and federal level because it will exhibit the utility of satellite and lidar data for regional application in a high priority region in the western U.S., catalyzing the use of satellite data for regulatory applications. Specifically, the satellite and lidar data will provide  greater spatial information of PM2.5 abundances in SJV at sufficient resolution to demonstrate the influence of local sources. The final products of this project will enable assessment of the existing PM2.5 monitoring network in SJV, model validation, comparison to results of previous intensive  studies in SJV such as CRPAQS, and development of effective PM2.5 control measures. In the long term, this project may establish the need for additional intensive field campaigns or a ground-based lidar network in SJV. The results of this project will be made available for a potential  "weight-of-evidence" analysis for the PM2.5 attainment demonstration in the SJV PM2.5 state implementation plan (SIP) and may be incorporated into the SIP in a future review.  The role of the UCD in this project is to build upon existing photochemical model results previously developed to support  CARB's SIP. The contractor will produce a detailed comparison of high resolution satellite aerosol optical depth to model results of aerosol optical depth for several seasons in 2000. Since this project will use satellite data already collected by NASA, the plan will not cover satellite data  collection, retrieval, and technical processes taking place in that agency's quality system.   The following details the SOW tasks:  Task 1:  Obtain Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model outputs for several parts of year 2000 from ARB. Calculate model derived aerosol optical depths using  the initial method already developed [e.g., Roy et al., 2005]. Compare satellite-derived AOD with modeled AOD for available satellite results.  This type of comparison will help provide quantitative information on the accuracy of model results for PM2.5 in SJV, both below and above the boundary  layer.  Task 2:  Provide modeling meteorological results for the winter 2000 period to other collaborators (i.e., NASA Langley and EPA) for the winter climatology characterization of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV). Assemble meteorological measurements in SJV, including CRPAQS data base and CARB  monitoring sites, wind profiler, cloud measurements, boundary layer measurements, weather service (Conis), CALIPSO cloud data (if available), and NOAA meteorology data.  Task 3:  Provide modeling aerosol results for the winter 2000 period to other collaborators (i.e., NASA Langley and EPA) for the  winter particulate matter characterization of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV). Assemble air quality measurements in SJV from sources such as the CARB ground-based measurement network and possibly from the AERONET sites in SJV.  Task 4:  In conjunction with collaborators at NASA and EPA, develop  mathematical/statistical computer routines for data comparison and quantitative analysis of ground-based PM2.5, lidar aerosol, and satellite aerosol optical depth data that will be collected during December 2006-January 2007.   Task 5:  Contribute results to the project's quarterly reports for AMI,  prepare a document summarizing the analysis conducted during this project, and prepare one journal article containing significant findings.   EPA believes that UCD is the only source capable of providing the required services due to their unique experience and in-depth knowledge of photochemical  gird models and experience in modeling particulate matter in the San Joaquin Valley, CA.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The period of  performance of the order is expected to be from October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent  of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Submit your response to  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Rebecca Clausen, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.

The proposed acquisition is for Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) for which the Government does not own drawings or specification.  Trilectron Industries holds the technical drawings, specifications, and data rights to manufacture the support equipment.    
    
NAWCADLKE intends to procure these items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (C) (1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

In phase two, the contractor takes the Master Waybill File and computes the mileage for specific movements and makes additional modifications to the waybill file so that it useable to the Government and other users.  The waybill processing cycle covers a 15-month period.  The 2007 waybill sample processing cycle starts January 1, 2007 and ends May 31, 2008.  This cycle covers those movements entered into the railroad’s accounting system on or before December 31, 2006 and that has not been reported in a previous waybill sample.  Movements that fall within this period are included as long as they terminate and are reported by the railroad by December 31, 2007.  Subsequent option years start on January 1 and end 15 months later on May 31.  For three months of each year the contractor will be working on two different waybill sample years.  The contract period shall extend approximately three months beyond the end of each processing cycle, and will end with the delivery and acceptance by the Government of the Public Use Waybill File.  The contract period of performance will be for 45 months, which consist of a 15 months base period with two consecutive 15 months option periods. The contract type is anticipated to be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) with the potential for multiple awards.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE. THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT/NEGOTIATE/AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS WITH ACTION TARGET, INC., PROVO, UT, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1). The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Arma ments Command (TACOM) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract for the procurement of one Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) range package, known commercially as a Modular Armored Tactical Combat House (MATCH) shoothouse at Fort Riley, KS to Action Target, Inc. (ATI) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Action Target is the only company able to meet the Governments requirement for a MOUT identical  to the one Action Target installed at Camp Butler, Iraq  a MATCH system proprietary to ATI. The Government does not have data rights to the MATCH and has not developed performance specifications to obtain MOUT ranges competitively. No MOUT layouts or flo or plans are available for distribution and additional site visits would be time and cost prohibitive to the Government. The Fort Riley MATCH will be used to train US soldiers assigned to a critical program designed to train advisors to the Iraqi Army and thus must be identical to the facility used at Camp Butler, Iraq. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals and no solicitations will be forthcoming. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely at the discre tion of the Government. All responses to this notice should be sent by e-mail to Gregg Johnson at johnsong2@ria.army.mil and must be received by COB 11 August 2006.

<DESC>The White Sans Missile Range Contracting Office plans to procure on a sole source basis two (2) DROP-300 Remote Video Surveillance Systems from Digital Force Technologies, 9455 Waples Street, Suite 100, San Diego, CA  92121.  The DROP-300 Remote Vide o Surveillance Systems include:  GSM, Globalstar, Iridium Transceivers, PIR Motion Sensors, AES Image Encryption and APT Absolute Pan-Tilt System.  In addition, DFT DROP Training and Night Vision Imager Modules; with GEN III Image Intensified Imager 64/pmm  and 170mm Catadioptric Lens, compatible with APT will be provided.  This system is unique on the market based on the features it provides. These key distinguishing features include: - Video capture from any standard NTSC video source. The DROP-300 allows existing and legacy cameras to be used and does not require proprietary digital camera systems.  - Browser-based user interface. The DROP-300 allows any computer to easily connect to, operate, and program the DROP-300 CPU. No external software is required to be loaded onto the computer. This reduces training time as most users are already familiar wi th common web browser software.   - Modular use of various satellite transceivers.  The DROP-300 system allows for interchangeable use of several different satellite transceivers. These include Globalstar, Iridium, GSM cellular, and Thuraya (currently under development).  - AES Encryption.  The DROP-300 system provides the option to encrypt all images being sent over the reach-back link using AES encryption with a 256-bit key.  This commercial strong encryption allows for commercially secure transmission of images over com mercial networks.    - Small physical size. The DROP-300 main unit measures 9.5W x 7.25D x 1.75H.  - Video Motion Detection. The DROP-300 implements video motion detection to trigger capture of images. This can be custom configured through the web-browser interface.    - Live connect. The DROP-300 allows a remote user to connect to the device and re-position the camera (by controlling a connected pan-tilt unit) and view instantaneously updated images over the satellite link.  - Remote control of Pan, Tilt, Zoom, Focus, Iris.  The DROP-300 allows a remote user to control the pan, tilt, zoo, focus, and iris of a connected camera and pan-tilt platform. This firm is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the DROP-300 Remote Surveillance Systems.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation will be forthcoming.  See Note 22.

<RESPDATE>092306
<ARCHDATE>11222006
<CONTACT>Stephen Alkire, 703 325-3356
<DESC>1. Contracting Activity:  US Army Contracting Agency, Information Technology, E-Commerce, and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC-4), 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331-1700. This notice is being published as required by FAR 5.201 and any bids or proposals received in response to it shall be  considered.  See Government-Wide numbered note 22. 2. Background: The Defense Travel System (DTS) is an Acquisition Category 1AM (ACAT 1AM) system that has been procured by the  Department of Defense (DoD) for the management of travel within DoD. The system is mission critical and requires adequate  sustainment of operation to enable official travel within DoD. DTS is now the officially designated system to be used by DoD  for commercial temporary duty travel. Over thirty-five financial systems have been adapted to use DTS, and travel business  processes of all services and agencies have been modified to eliminate the historical paper systems used to process travel  vouchers and reimburse travelers for out-of-pocket expenses. The Program Management Office - Defense Travel System (PMO-DTS) is the management authority for the program. System  Operations and Maintenance, Development, Training, and Help Desk activities are currently carried out under contract number  DAMT01-98-D-1005 with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS) in Fair Lakes, VA. This contract expires on 29 September 2006,  and PMO-DTS is in the process of competitively awarding a new contract for the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) and Development  portions of the current contract.  3. Proposed Contract Action. In conjunction with this reprocurement action, PMO-DTS intends to extend the O&M and development  portions of the current contract for a period of six months beyond the current expiration date. The purpose of the extension  is to enable NGMS to serve as a transition contractor, and transfer to a new contractor system documentation and the design  knowledge of the system it has gained due to its performance under the current contract.. In addition, continued performance  by NGMS will be necessary in the event of unanticipated delays to the reprocurement action. The scope of work for the transition contractor effort is envisioned to consist of the following activities: * Operations & Maintenance  o Six month extension (Sep 30, 2006  Apr 2, 2007) o Basic tasks are hosting, operating, and maintaining DTS, including failing over to the 2nd CDC if needed.  Ensure continued  operation of the Defense Travel System by providing transition to a successor contractor if required. * Global Distribution System (GDS) Connectivity o Six month extension (Sep 30, 2006  Apr 2, 2007) o Includes connecting to and exchanging information with the GDSs  on travel and lodging schedules and availability.  Ensure  continued operation of the Defense Travel System by providing transition to a successor contractor if required. * Development  o Six month extension (Sep 30, 2006  Apr 2, 2007) o The development task includes the continuation of design, coding, and integration of software currently under development.   Provide a transition to successor contractor if required. * Testing o Six month extension (Sep 30, 2006  Apr 2, 2007) o The testing task includes developing and conducting software tests to verify that the developed software meets functional  requirements.  Provide a transition to successor contractor if required * Travel Expense Reimbursement  o Six month extension (Sep 30, 2006  Apr 2, 2007) o Support travel associated with the above effort, if required.  o Provides for reimbursement of expenses incurred by contractor personnel in traveling as needed to carry out contract tasks The Government envisions the following transition activities within the six-month extension period: Transfer of all relevant documents describing the Defense Travel System from the transition con tractor to the new  contractor, and review by appropriate technical staff. There are 329 hardware configuration items, and 672 software  configuration items. [AI1] Work performed by teams staffed by the transition contractor and the new contractor on O&M and  development tasks, with sharing of effort and transfer of knowledge between contractors. This will include assigning system  problems to new contractor teams for resolution, with personnel from the transition contractor available for consultation.  This is envisioned to enable the identification of areas needing more time or more work, that present particular difficulty  in the transition to the new contractor. Problem areas will be documented for particular management attention, and, if  necessary, appropriate training will be provided to contractor personnel. Hardware transition will begin during this period. T Trouble-shooting tasks carried out by the new contractor with gradually decreasing oversight by the transition contractor, to  ensure that needed knowledge is transferred and capabilities are being developed. As the new contractor personnel gain  expertise, and demonstrate their ability to resolve problems and keep the system operating, the transition contractor support  level will decline. Hardware transition will be completed during this period, and the system will be turned on and operating  in the new environment. 4. Contractor Qualifications: The transition contractor must (1) possess system design expertise and  have the ability to trouble-shoot and fix DTS system problems; and (2) be  able to transfer DTS  knowledge and expertise to a  new contract awardee upon the award of a new contract for DTS O&M and development, within a period of six months or less.  The following are the Points of Contact (POCs) for this action.  All communications concerning this notice must be sent to  both POCs: Christos Daoulas, Contracting Officer, christos.daoulas@itec4.army.mil;  Stephen Alkire, Contract Specialist, stephen.alkire@itec4.army.mil

<DESC>This notice serves as Amendment No. 2 to BAA06-25.  DARPA is announcing that DARPA BAA 06-25 Micro Isotope Power Sources remains open until March 13, 2007. Concurrent with publication of this notice, DARPA is publishing a revised Proposer’s Information Pamphlet (PIP). Proposers are requested to use the revised PIP for all future submissions.

September 12, 2006 at 4:00 Eastern Time is hereby established as a second deadline for submission of proposals.  Proposers are required to submit proposals by this time to be considered in the second round of evaluations; however, proposals received before or after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from the initial date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov. Proposals should be submitted in the manner outlined in the initial BAA, and in the format outlined in the revised PIP. 

Proposers who submitted proposals that were not selected during the first round of evaluation may submit new or amended proposals. It is suggested that these proposers request an informal debrief from the Program Manager prior to submitting a new or amended proposal. 

DARPA does intend to make awards based upon proposals submitted during the first round of evaluations. However, DARPA found that the majority of the proposals submitted during the first round were deficient in that (1) they did not provide a path to achieve the program metrics, and/or (2) they outlined a period of performance that was too long. DARPA is targeting a period of performance substantially less than 24 months.  

The BAA is hereby amended to include schedule and period of performance as the sixth selection criterion. 

Offerers are encouraged to contact the MIPS Program Manager with any questions regarding this BAA. For answering questions, email correspondence is highly encouraged. Contact information is as follows:

Questions and Responses

Question No. 1:

In the description for this Pre-Sol Notice, the requirements for Section G are described as “Section H”.  If I have interpreted this incorrectly, please advise.

Response No. 1:

The Amendment to this solicitation clarifies this issue.

Question No. 2:

I’m inquiring about DOL061RP20084 Architectural and Engineering Design Services at the Gulfport Job Corps Center located in Gulfport, MS.  Does the 24 week design time also include construction on the site.   

Response No. 2:

The Total Design Time is 24 calendar weeks.  The Period of Performance for construction is not addressed in this solicitation.

Question No. 3:

The Pre-Solicitation is requiring Parts 1 & Part II for the Prime and also requests Part 1’s for consulting firms.  Does the Part I for consultants only apply to the Block H’s submittal or is this supposed to be Part II for each consultant we plan on using instead of a Part I? 

Response No. 3:

The Amendment to this solicitation clarifies this issue.

Question No. 4:

In the second paragraph of the Pre-Solicitation notice, it states that “one copy of SF-330 Part 1 is required for each of its individual consulting firms, if applicable”.

Does this mean that our final proposal shall include Part 1, Part 2 from us (_______Architects), as well as Part I from each of our consulting firms?  In past solicitations, we were only required to include Part 2 from our consulting firms.  We just wanted to clarify this issue.

 
Response No. 4:

The Amendment to this solicitation clarifies this issue.

Question No. 5:

We are a Small Emerging Business seeking potential subcontracting opportunities on this project.  Would it be possible to post the list of interested Vendors to facilitate subcontracting discussions?  

Response No. 5:

The Department of Labor does not have prior knowledge of interested Architectural Engineering firms that will answer this solicitation until the SF-330 is received from those firms.  The SF-330 will identify the interested firms and their selected consultant teams.  The Department of Labor can not provide the requested information for this type of solicitation for professional services.

Description
           This is a synopsis of the Pre-Solicitation Notice for a commercial service. This announcement constitutes the synopsis only. A written solicitation will be available on this web site on or about 5 July 2006. However, maps will be unavailable via this web site and will require a written/email request from each interested party. This procurement is a 100% set aside for Small Business Contractors with relevant experience. The solicitation document, which will be available on this web site, will incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation. This will be a best value procurement utilizing Performance Price Tradeoff processes, where past performance is approximately equal to price when being evaluated. The NAICS Code for this project is 562212 with a size standard of $11.5 million dollars.
MacDill AFB is permitted by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) to operate a 1.2 million gallons per day (MGD) domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).  The WWTP uses an activated sludge process to treat the wastewater so that it meets water quality standards for irrigation.  This process produces biosolids that must be removed from the WWTP and disposed off base.  MacDill AFB treats the biosolids at the WWTP in two 180,000 gallon aerobic digesters to Class B standards prior to removal and off-base disposal.  MacDill AFB requires the services of an independent contractor to remove the treated biosolids from the WWTP.  The contractor shall follow all applicable environmental regulations.
	The Period of Performance is anticipated to begin 01 Oct 2006 through 30 Sep 2007 for the basic period plus four one year option periods.

******************  


DESC: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE for FA8601-06-B-0005; project number 050021. Period of Performance is 135 days. NAICS CODE: 238220. Size Standard $13.0 Million. Replace Air Handling Unit and Ducts, WPAFB, OH. Estimated Cost of Proposed Acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.

Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov or 1-888-CCR-2423. 

Scope of Work: This requirement is for replacement of the air handler that serves bldg 29 and updates to the DDC controls.  This includes replacement of the main supply and return ductwork from the mechanical room through the main shaft and out to each floor.  Installation of VAV boxes is included.  The new air handler requires a larger space; therefore, the mechanical room will require enlargement.  This further requires abatement of asbestos pipe insulation, asbestos floor, wall, & ceiling tile along with lead paint abatement.  Areas of the ceiling on each floor will have to be removed and reinstalled.  

Special Requirements/Concerns: This facility is to remain occupied during the construction.

<DESC>Please reflect a clarification on Small business set aside. This acquisition is not a set aside for small business. The NAICS code placed in original Synopsis 541310 is not applicable. FAR 219.502-1 States “an award under $300,000 will be a set aside for small business for A and E contracts”. This acquisition is more than $300,000. Therefore, this acquisition is not set aside for small businesses.



In Reference to Solicitation HQ0034-06-R-1029. This notice is to provide the latest status on the Award process. The DD330 submitted are currently being evaluated. We had 19 responses.

At that time these successful selectees will be called in to present Oral Presentations. Then a short list will be developed of the top three selectees.

These three selectees will be asked to submit proposal on a Statement of Work. The proposal will be evaluated within the time frame of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 30-days. A final selectee will be notified by approximately 15 September, negotiations will take place, and a final awardee will be announced in/or around 15 October 2006.

<DESC>The Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB), Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health is recompeting a project for the animal care and maintenance for a colony of up to 17,000 mice in accordance with the standards outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as published in DHHS Publication No. (NIH 86-23), the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (September 1986) and the Animal Welfare Act in 1976.  This contract provides a facility for holding and breeding of experimental animals in support of research of the EIB.  Multiple strains are bred for experimental needs, when such animals are not available commercially.  This includes the breeding of multiple transgenic and “knock-out” mice, some of which are generated by EIB investigators.  This contract permits investigators to import mice from other laboratories unusual mouse strains that may carry infectious agents including viruses.  A quarantine room complete with sterile barriers is maintained so those mice from outside sources can be screened for pathogens.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) in relation to the provision of Stages 3 & 4 of the Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Radio Network for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The goal of the PSYOPS network is to create a supporting atmosphere among the Afghan leadership and population in support of the objectives of the ISAF expanded mission.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee (IC). The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA procedure with the additional opportunity for the Nations in response to this Notification of Intent (NOI) to nominate bidders in addition to the companies identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 6 million Euros ($7.6 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-12079-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Within the ISAF Area of Operations (AOO), a radio network is required to receive the central program from Kabul and re-broadcast it locally to reach specified Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) regions. In addition, at the Regional Command (RC) level, a network must support alternative broadcast of regionally produced programs to their subordinated PRTs.

PSYOPS transmitters located at PRTs will be linked with a radio studio through VSAT.

This project will extend the PSYOPS Radio Network to the 17 PRT locations, in the Southern and Eastern region of Afghanistan.

The radio network will require the following components:

- 5 KW commercial FM Band radio transmitters with 20m masts and antennas
- CIS shelters with heating and air-conditioning to accommodate the FM transmitters
- Generators and Un-interruptible Power Supply (UPS) units
- Audio processing and VSAT capability adaptation equipment
- 1 KW FM transmitters (for repeater locations) with 20m masts, antennas, VSAT receivers, and demodulators

Capability must be operational within the commercial FM band from 87.5 to 107.0 MHz.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET.  

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be introduced by their National Delegations with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

In addition, personnel working on this project, or visiting installations and/or working at NATO sites, are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 23 August 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: September 2006

3. Anticipated contract award date: November 2006

<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Region Geographic Information Office has an opportunity to acquire high-resolution orthorectified imagery which the State of Arkansas has agreed to share this data at approximately 28% of the total cost which is a substantial cost saving for the government. Imagery is for urban areas of interest in Sebastian, Miller, Garland and Saline County Arkansas covering a geographic extent of approximately 235 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangles (approximately 2406 square miles) encompassing Sebastian, Miller, Garland and Saline Counties. The USGS is reacting to a Department of Homeland Security request for current, high-resolution orthorectified images to support Homeland Security.  A requirement of the imagery is that it be less than two years old and be public domain, 1-foot deliverable product, True Natural Color with horizontal accuracy that meets or exceeds 6 meters at a 95% confidence level; NAD 83 Datum; Arkansas State Plan Coordinate System North Projection; Geotiff with accompanying world (TWF) file; USGS high-resolution DOQQ requirement. The imagery will be utilized at the Federal level for homeland security purposes, emergency preparedness and response, natural resource studies, planning and economic development, and agricultural census. Imagery will be collected during the spring of 2006 and shall be delivered within sixty (60) days from the ASLIB delivery date. The anticipated delivery date is December 31, 2006. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers this requirement specified as a sole source from Arkansas State Land Information Board (ASLIB), 124 West Capital, Suite 200, Little Rock, AR 72201 and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required digital orthoimagery or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<SUBJECT>Y -- SPECIAL NOTICE  ANTICIPATION OF RELEASE OF RFP FOR PRIVATIZATION OF MFH TRI-GROUP PROJECT
<DESC>Department of the Air Force, HQ Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, HQ AFCEE, and 311 Human Systems Wing (HSW)/PK, 8150 Aeromedical Road, Brooks City-Base, TX, 78235-5123. Description:  Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Program Office – San Antonio, and the Headquarters Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the Tri-Group project on or about 10 August 2006. The Tri-Group project consists of three bases: Los Angeles AFB, CA, Peterson AFB, CO and Schriever AFB, CO. Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In their proposals, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources, financial strategy, and a description of its technical approach to the Tri-Group project as described in the RFP. Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranking Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force. The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction. These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP. The Tri-Group project is a real estate transaction to privatize 1,564 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,564 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 1,111 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO). The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the RFP. The PO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Tri-Group family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the PO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the PO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Request for Proposal is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-32 - Sandblaster Program Proposer's Day Workshop
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Workshop in support of the BAA06-45 Sandblaster Program on August 23, 2006 at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 3811 Fairfax Drive, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Sandblaster Program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the Sandblaster Program is to enable rotary wing aircraft to land safely in brown-out conditions with a minimum of pilot and/or crew compensation.  The desired system will include necessary sensors, instruments and pilot displays, and at a minimum, provide zero-visibility brownout landing capability with warning of lateral fore and aft drift, of ground obstacles and sloping/uneven terrain in the landing zone that could induce dynamic roll-over, and of potential collisions with other nearby aircraft and building structures.  Landing guidance will come from conventional/modified instrumentation and pilot displays, new human-factored, cognitive Primary Functional Displays, or combinations of both.  The desired system must be able to be developed quickly on a rapid success-oriented schedule.  The desired system must be affordable in volume production.  It is highly desirable that methods for incorporating the Sandblaster capability into legacy UH-60M, UH-60A, and UH-60L models, and other legacy military helicopters, be identified. 
 
REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register NLT August 18, 2006 at the following website:   https://enstg.com/signup/passthru.cfm?ConferenceCode=SAN68226.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.  NOTE:  It is highly recommended that all potential proposers attend the Conference, in order to respond to this BAA.  Certain sensitive technical information about US military helicopter performance will only be provided at the Conference, and in a Supplemental Information Package (Distribution Notice Code  X: Distribution authorized to US Government Agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export-controlled technical data in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25,)  Conference attendees must show eligibility to obtain such data.

The Proposers' Day conference will be unclassified and will be open to qualified, registered, and approved attendees only.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.    The completed Citizenship Form must be faxed to (Attention: Pamela Jackson) at 703-696-9781 no later than August 18, 2006.  This form is available for download at the registration website.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MS. Barbara Levy, 14809 Soft Wind Drive North Potomac, MD 20878, For a modification to Purchase Order 263-MD-605508
for a six-month continuation of the service being provided for the Division of Acquisition Planning and Evaluation (DAPE). Ms Levy is the only known source capable of providing the required services because of her involvement in this project over the past months.  Further, inherent duplication of cost to the Government would be time and cost prohibiting.  

Due to understaffing, DAPE has been given more responsibilities, resulting in an increased workload. During FY2006 and FY2007, the Balanced Scorecard Initiative will require that DAPE conduct Procurement Management Reviews of three Offices of Acquisition as well as participate in the analysis and recommendation of corrective actions based on the results of surveys for each of the newly established Offices of Acquisition under the administrative restructuring program (ARAC).
 
As a result of the increased workload and the concurrent understaffing of DAPE, several of its activities that are vital to the Director, OAMP in her capacity as Head of the Contracting Activity, as well as activities that would benefit the NIH contracting community, have not been able to be completed or have not been completed in a timely fashion. Many of these activities are not inherently governmental and could therefore be performed under a contractual arrangement. These activities are both of a day-to-day nature as well as special projects requiring quick response.  

The demands of the staff of DAPE allow little time for orienting and training a consultant in the work that will be needed. There will be little opportunity to give detailed instruction on how to carry out the work, what contacts will be available, needed, or appropriate, what sources can be used to research issues, etc. The consultant must have sufficient knowledge of the work that DAPE carries out in order to function as independently as possible. Based on Ms Levy's 16 plus years as a procurement analyst on DAPE she has the skills and knowledge necessary so that orientation and training are not needed.


Statement of Work:
The DAPE has a need for a contractor to provide expert knowledge of the Division and the skills and abilities to complete several projects that are integral part of the mission of the DAPE. These projects include, but are not limited to:
•	Provide advice on the Procurement Management Reviews.
•	Prepare checklists for various types of acquisitions as a tool for the DAPE staff in their roles s members of the NIH Board of Contract Awards. These checklists may also be used in another standardization effort for HHS.
•	Review existing Instruction and Information Memoranda (I&Is) and recommend which ones should be converted to NIH Manual Chapters and which should be permanently rescinded.
•	Review the current Acquisition Map and make recommendations for updating it in light of the new organizational structure. 
•	Provide advice and assistance on updating the JOFOC Desk Guide.
•	Participate in any special subject reviews as required.
•	Prepare the annual report on common issues found in the Board of Awards minutes, as well as recommend corrective actions on serious deficiencies.
 
Period of Performance: Extended through February 28, 2007. The estimated number of hours per week is variable but is projected that approximately 2 days per week will be required for a total of approximately 300 hours. The estimate of hours may be reevaluated as necessary, as tasks arise.

Miscellaneous: The Government will provide the necessary supplies and materials, and will provide work space, computer, and other items needed to perform the work on-site as necessary.


This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit  and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.

However, all quotes received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government .  A determination by the Government  not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition requirement  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received  will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. Cocerns that respond to this synopsis shall furnish cocise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above and are invited to submit proposal and/or capability statements in an Original Plus Two no later than ten (10) business days from the date of this announcement, August 9, 2006 due in COB August 21, 2006.  Written responses shall include complete description of the services to be provided, containing sufficient technical information to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the stated requirements as listed above.  Proposals and/or Capability Statements shall be sent to: If mailing your capabilities through the U.S> Postal Service use the following address: National Institutes of Health, Office of Logistics and Operations,OA, 6011 Executive Blvd.,Rm. 529V Attn: Lloyd Garnes, Bethesda, MD 20892, telephone: 301-402-3341. (b)If hand delivering, or using a courier service such as UPS, Federal Express, etc., use the following City,State and Zip Code: Rockville, MD 20852. Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results. (c) may be emailed to Lloyd Garnes at garnesl@od.nih.gov no later than August 21, 2006.

Training:  The successful offeror shall conduct training on the system.  Training shall include all aspects of the operation of the sodar and associated equipment and software.  At a minimum the training shall include setup, calibrations/self-check (including all possible adjustments to be made to the sodar – either hardware or software based on the results of the cal./self check), operation of the sodar, downloading of data (if applicable), manipulations/interpretation of data, and operation of data presentation software.  Delivery of one hardcopy and one electronic file of a user manual, repair parts breakdown list, and repair manual.  The electronic file(s) shall be in pdf format.  Additionally the training shall include information on site selection considerations and sodar settings to deal with individual site issues.  Training will be conducted at the San Dimas Technology and Development Center. Packaging: The Sodar and all equipment needed to operate, collect, and store wind profile data shall be integrated together into a trailer whose tongue weight shall be 500 lbs or less.  The trailer shall include solar cells necessary to power all the equipment needed to operate the sodar, collect and store the wind profile data.  The trailer shall have battery power to allow for 24-hour operations.  The solar panels shall be of sufficient capacity to allow the batteries to be recharged during the day and allow for a minimum autonomous operation shall be 72 hours.  Additionally, the trailer shall be built to power the sodar and all necessary equipment from standard power (110-115 volts).  Switching from solar to standard power shall be through a single switch.  The trailer hitch shall be compatible with a standard 2-inch ball.  The trailer shall protect all of the equipment from the environment and theft when the unit is parked for storage (non-operation).

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

FAR 52.212-2   Evaluation – Commercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

M.1.  PREPARING THE PROPOSAL
Offerors shall submit a copy of their technical and cost proposal.  Proposals shall, at a minimum, contain the items described in this section.  Each proposal shall contain sufficient information to enable a thorough evaluation.  Proposals must specifically address the goals and requirements of the specifications.  The offeror’s capabilities to accomplish the requirements of this solicitation must be clearly demonstrated.  All proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government’s statement of work will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered further.  

M. 2.   EVALUATION CRITERIA
Technical Proposal – The following is listed in descending order of importance:
1.  Experience.  Describe experience performing requirements similar during the past 3 years.  Include accurate information that will allow the evaluators to contact contract administrators involved with the referenced work.  Names, phone numbers, dates, locations, type of work, etc. are critical.  Specifically identify a foreman that you will provide for the performance of this contract as a Key Personnel.  Provide information about his/her experience. Provide sufficient information so that the evaluators may make contact with anyone who can verify these experiences.

2.  Past Performance.  Provide details on quality of work performed on all similar contracts within the past 3 years.  List and discuss any work not paid at full bid price.  Address specific performance failures and how you mitigated the cause of those failures.  Provide details regarding timeliness of performance or lack thereof.  Discuss business performance statement that describes relationships and cooperation with customers.  Include any investigation of alleged or actual violations of labor or immigration laws committed by your firm within the past three years and the disposition of those cases. 
 3.  Technical Approach. 

Understanding of the Government’s  Requirements.  The Government will evaluate each offeror’s relative understanding of the Government’s requirements on the basis of its written submittals addressing the following sub factors:
a.)	Any information that indicates the extent to which the site for this project was visited.

	4.  Price Proposal. The price proposal should consist of itemized pricing as listed in the Schedule of Items.  Award may not necessarily be made to the offeror submitting the lowest offer.  Also, the award may not be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for successful performance of the work.  The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest of the Government.  It is anticipated that the award will be made to the firm with the best value, considering price, technical proposal, and technical capabilities. 

M. 3.    BASIS FOR AWARD
The Government will award the contract to the offeror(s) who (a) asserts to the terms of the solicitation, and (b) has the best combination of experience, past performance technical proposal, and price.  Experience is a matter of the number of opportunities an offeror has had to do similar work and to encounter the kinds of problems that the Contractor is likely to encounter in the performance of this contract.  Past performance is a matter of an offeror’s reputation for integrity and customer satisfaction.  Quality control and the understanding of the work is a matter of the offeror’s familiarity with the nature of the work and with the kinds of problems the Contractor is likely to encounter during performance. 

Award(s) may be made without further discussions.  Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and cost standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government.  However, the Government may, after evaluation of the proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range. 

Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate , the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort  Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the em ployee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor emp loyees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC t o conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast acce ss identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contract or employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors p ass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no lon ger needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or co pied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on th e day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor em ployee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the F AGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accor dance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.

Hard copies will not be available. Offerors should check the FEDTEDS Web Page often for new solicitations and/or changes (Amendments) to existing ones. Solicitation Number W912HZ-06-T-0045   is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) wi th the intent to award as a firm fixed-price contract using simplified acquisition procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.  This procurement is Full and Open Competition.  The USACE, ERDC   (Detailed Specifications are available on the FEDTEDS website) This procurement may be quoted as follows:  ITEM	DESCRIPTION	QUANTITY	U/I	UNIT PRICE	TOTAL AMOUNT 0001	Provide Fiber Optic	2	EA	$___________	$_________________ OPTIONAL 0002	Backscatter Sensors in accordance with attached specifications: Provide Fiber Optic Backscatter Sensors in accordance with attached specifications 	 1	EA	$___________	$_________________ 						TOTAL 		$_________________ SPECIFICTIONS 1.  The Large-scale Sediment Transport Facility (LSTF) is a 30 m by 50 m by 1.4 m basin that was constructed to reproduce surf zone processes found on long beaches at a relatively large scale. Research being conducted in the LSTF is leading to improved met hods for estimating surf zone sediment transport. The facility contains wave generators, a recirculation system, a sand beach, an automated instrumentation bridge, and a suite of instruments to measure wave heights, currents, and transported sediment. The LSTF sand beach is approximately 18 m wide by 30 m long, with depths up to 1.0 m.  2.  The purpose of the LSTF is to measure sediment transport and it is equipped with sediment traps that capture the total transport rate, but the traps do not distinguish between suspended or bedload transport.  An instrument that measures suspended conce ntration is a Fiber Optic Backscatter Sensor (FOBS) array.  Each sensor array simultaneously measures sediment concentration at multiple positions in the water column.  Data are logged on a PC-based data acquisition system.  The FOBS sensor arrays enable s imultaneous measurement of suspended sediment concentration at multiple positions through the water column that, together with velocity measurements, allow calculation of local and integrated suspended sediment flux.  In concert with traps in the LSTF that  measure total longshore sediment load and estimates of alongshore suspended sediment flux made with the FOBS, estimates of sediment moving alongshore on and in the bed layer can be made.  Suspended sediment concentration is higher near the bed and the dep ths over which measurements are made are typically 50 cm or less. 3.  The LSTF requires two FOBS.  Each FOBS requires at least 20 sensors spaced to cover a depth of approximately 50 cm.  The first 10 sensors on the lower end should be spaced 1 cm apart.  The remaining, upper, sensors should be spaced logarithmically or q uasi-logarithmically to cover the upper 40 cm.  Each sensor should have a solid-state light source to alleviate problems with phase error.  Each sensor should be capable of accurately measuring concentrations from 0 to 100 mg/l.  The sensors must be durabl e to withstand waves up to 0.5 m in height, having periods ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 sec, and with 0.5 m/s currents superimposed all concurrently.  The instrument in the water must be of a size as to not disrupt the flow of waves and curren ts (on the order of less than 2 cm). 4.  The 2 FOBS must be capable of sampling at 20 Hz.  Data must be transferred from the LSTF instrument bridge to control room.  The LSTF may be expanded in the future; therefore, the instruments must be capable of transmitting data a distance of approxima tely 150 m.  Data output should be in ASCII, or in a format that can easily be integrated into the LSTF data collection software.   5.  The instrument would be required to operate in an extreme environment. The LSTF is located in a shelter and, while protected against rain, it is subjected to heat, cold and humidity. The instrument must be able to operate in ambient temperatures rangin g from 20 deg F to in excess of 100 deg F, and humidity greater than 90 percent. Lastly, the servomotors that operate the wave generators, bridge and cross-shore motor generate electronic noise. The instrument should be immune to electronic noise associate d with existing equipment, or have the capability to operate with DC power, although it is preferred to operate the FOBS from 110V power available on the instrumentation bridge. 6.  The FOBS instruments provided by the vendor should meet the following requirements: a.  Twenty (20) sensors per FOBS that will measure concentration over a 50 cm depth. b.  Spacing of the 10 lower sensors should be 1 cm and spacing of the upper 10 sensors should be logarithmic or quasi-logaritmic spaced over the remaining length. c.  Each of the sensors should have solid-state light source. d.  The FOBS and sensors must be durable to withstand the wave and currents generated in the LSTF: wave heights up to 0.5 m with periods ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 sec superimposed with currents up to 0.5 m/s. e.  Data sampling rate of at least 20 Hz. f.  Capability to transfer data at least 150 m to LSTF control room. g.  Data output in ASCII format or a format that can easily be integrated into LSTF data collection software. h.  Delivery of the product that meets all requirements within 60 days of awarding of contract. Following delivery, acceptance testing will be performed and compared to concentration measurements previously obtained in the LSTF.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:  Dell desktop computers are required to provide the reliability and functionality required by the Office of Overseas Building Operations.  The equipment is for use in the OBO Community and is used by multiple personnel constantly.  Dell is one of the main computer equipment manufacturers and is known for reliability, functionality, cost effectiveness and maintainability improved through R&D. OBO/IM/NOMB has diligently researched three major computer companies with the following criteria - Cost, reliability, CPU speed, CPU manufacturer, CPU configuration, memory, memory expansion, bus speed, video memory, video speed, display size, display dps, ), maintainability (R&D), and reliability. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The R&D portion is important as this saves man-hours in maintenance and repair times.  The Dell equipment is approved by Diplomatic Security for both for standalone use and for Main State SDI use.  If other than the specific Dell desktops required are procured, there will likely be functionality issues in various individual divisions which will result in the division procuring the equipment a second time to get the functionality and reliability they require.  The cost savings are in man-hours for M & R, functionality, speed, and upgradability.  Not meeting the above wastes man-hours and budget. No Remanufactured, No Refrubished equipment is acceptable.  New only. CHANGED CONFIGURATION CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them.

Please note that any such evaluation criteria must be articulated in the solicitation to the extent required by such regulations and/or guidelines.

(With Exchange of Spent Cartridges Required)


SCOPE AND CLASSIFICATION

1.1	 Scope:  This specification covers Remanufactured Laser Printer Toner Cartridges. This specification does not include all varieties of printer toner cartridges, which are commercially available, but is intended to cover only those generally used by the United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA) for Hewlett Packard (Models 4M, 4050N, 4100, and 4600) and Xerox Laser Printers, Model N2125.  The remanufactured cartridges of the requirement shall be available with exchange of spent cartridges.  Note:  The contractor shall include a self-addressed prepaid freight return label in each remanufactured toner cartridge container supplied under this contract.

	1.2 Classification: The Laser Printer Toner Cartridges covered in this specification shall be furnished in the types for use in the Hewlett Packard and Xerox Laser Printer engines.


LASER PRINTER TONER CARTRIDGE—REMANUFACTURED 

2.1 New Long Life Aftermarket Photoconductor Drums: For each initial order (first time the Laser Printer Toner Cartridge is exchanged) the contractor shall furnish a remanufactured cartridge with a new, long life, aftermarket, photoconductor drum installed.  The average drum life for the new drum installations is listed below:

Hewlett Packard 4M Part No. 92298A		  6,800 Pages
HP 4050N Part No. C42127A				10,000 Pages

  3.  Yellow - Part No. C9722A                                    8,000 Pages
  4.  Magenta - Part No. C9723A                                  8,000 Pages

Prior to shipment, the contractor shall label each remanufactured cartridge with the following:

	1) The name of the company that did the remanufacturing.

		2) The date of the new photoconductor drum installation.
                                a) The subsequent dates that the cartridge has been refurbished for use following the initial installation of the new drum. 

	2.2 Remanufacture: The remanufacturing of laser printer cartridges will include the following steps as applicable to the toner cartridge:

1)	Disassemble the cartridge completely for thorough cleaning of all parts and replacement of any defective/unsatisfactory parts.  If used for cleaning purposes, alcohol must be pure with no water content.
	
2)	Lubricate the necessary parts as required.

3)	Refill the toner chamber with a premium grade (virgin/unused) toner of the appropriate consistency for the cartridge type per OEM specifications, and seal to prevent leakage during shipment.

4)	A reliable OEM adhesive type (cold seal) method of sealing the cartridge toner chamber shall be used.  Toner leakage during shipment or use will not be acceptable.

5)	Clean photoconductor drum, apply a polymer coating or replace as required. The contractor shall be responsible for testing the electronic resistance of the conductor surface of each drum to determine that optimum performance will be achieved during each usage cycle.  All cartridges being submitted for remanufacturing for the first time shall have a New Longlife Aftermarket Drum installed (see requirement 2.1).

6)	Set toner bar (doctor blade) spacing as required.  A new cleaning blade must be installed with each new drum installation.

7)	Seal cartridge in an anti-static polyfoil or Mylar bag (silver outside and black inside).  Bags with holes or broken seals will not be acceptable.

8)	Vendor shall furnish labels for cartridge return with each cartridge supplied to users, including instructions advising user to save packaging material, end caps, and encasement materials for return shipment use.  The kit must include a plastic bag with tie and a preprinted freight prepaid return shipping label.
 

	2.3 Spent Toner Cartridges: The vendor shall accept spent cartridges in any condition to exchange for remanufactured ones.  The Government cannot guarantee a one-for-one exchange for cartridges.  It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to provide remanufactured toner cartridges in the estimated amounts listed in the delivery schedule in the contract.

	2.4 Reports: The vendor shall submit monthly reports of the number of spent cartridges returned for remanufacture.


QUALITY CONTROL

3.1 Quality Control Plan: The contractor shall establish and implement a complete Quality Control Plan to assure the requirements of the contract are met in a satisfactory manner.  A copy of the Contractor Quality Control Program shall be provided to the Contracting Officer not later than the submission of the proposal.  An updated written document of the program shall be provided to the Contracting Officer for approval as changes occur.

3.2 Replacement of Defective Cartridges: The contractor shall establish and implement a plan to replace defective cartridges in the event that any occur.  A copy of the plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer with the submission of the proposal.  An updated written document of the Replacement Plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer for approval as changes occur.


4.	PREPARATION FOR DELIVERY

	4.1 Packaging: Each laser printer toner cartridge supplied under this specification must be delivered to the user in a water, light, and air-tight, protective package.  Material such as polyfoil with further foam insulation and corrugated carton packaging will be adequate for reshipping and storage of the product to assure safe delivery and satisfactory performance when installed for use.  All remanufactured laser printer toner cartridges shall be packaged to ensure safe delivery to destination.  Reuse of the original packing is encouraged whenever practical.  Cartons must be packed sufficiently to eliminate empty space that would allow movement of contents during shipment. OEM style packing for each cartridge shall be required.  End caps and/or bubble wrap shall be used for impact insulation for cartridges to be shipped individually by common carrier.

	4.2 Marking: Unless otherwise specified, shipping containers shall be marked with name of material, class and quantity contained herein, name of the contractor and contract and purchase order numbers.  Also, the package shall include a statement to “Retain for return of used cartridge”.
	
4.3 Shipping: Shipments made under this contract must be on pallets.  The pallet shall be 48” x 40” with the true fork side being the 48” side.  The freight shall not exceed 60” in height, which includes the pallet.  The product on the pallet must be shrink wrapped.
 

NOTES

5.1 Toner cartridges procured under this specification shall not deviate from the design specifications required for HP4M, HP4050N, HP4100, HP4600 and Xerox N2125 printers and HP4M, HP4050N, HP4100 and Xerox N2125 compatible printers without written approval from the Contracting Officer.

	5.2 This specification shall, until revised or rescinded by the Contracting Officer, apply to each future purchase and contract for the commodities described herein.

	
	5.3 It is the intent of the Farm Service Agency to encourage the use of commodities containing recycled content.  Bidders are encouraged to report such availability to the Contracting Officer for determination of price preference.

<DESC>This amendment is to add information specific to the design of the trailer and to change the response date from 8-9-06 to 8-14-06.


The ARTS Trailer measures 341 "L x 103"W x 57"H and has a gross vehicle weight rating of 14,000
pounds.

2. The ARTS Trailer is approved for air transport aboard USAF C-130, C141, C-17, and C-5 aircraft with
the following provisions:

a. The trailer shall be restrained following standard procedures and using certified provisions to meet
minimum restraint requirements of 3.0G fwd, 2.0G vertically, and 1.5G aft/laterally. The shipper
shall certify that any stowed, attached, or loose equipment carried with the trailer is capable of
meeting these same restraint requirements in addition to a potential 4.5G download.
Manufacturer ratings for tie down points are 10,000 pounds.

b. Approach shoring will be necessary to negotiate a 1 a-degree approach angle. Amount of shoring
will vary per aircraft type. (See attachment-1 for typical shoring requirement) Shipper should be
prepared to bring additional wood planking to adjust angle if aircraft loadmaster deems it
necessary.

c. C-130 aircraft: axle weights will be combined due to spacing and shall not exceed a total weight of
13,000 pounds. Combined axle weight less than 6000 pounds may be loaded between FS 262
and FS 737. For axle weighs between 6,001 and 13,000 pounds, axles must be loaded between
FS 337 and FS 682 for flight. C-141 aircraft: combined axle weighs between 10,000 and 20,000
pounds shall be positioned between FS 678 and FS 998 for flight.

d. If the gross vehicle weight exceeds 80% of the rated value or 11,200 pounds, sleeper shoring is
required. The shoring shall be place as close to the axle as possible between the aircraft floor
and within one inch of the trailer frame. Minimum size of shoring will be 14"L x 14"W at the base.

e. Do not use tongue jack to solely support trailer in flight. Support the trailer tongue with a stack of
sleeper shoring if the trailer is detached from the prime mover for flight. Minimum size of shoring
will be 12"L x 12"W at the base. Shipper is responsible for providing al/ required shoring.
Cargo loaded on the trailer bed for airlift should be positioned such that the projected height does
not present an overhead contact problem when loading the aircraft. The load should not exceed
105 inches in overall height for C-130 and C-141 shipment.

g. Tire pressure shall not exceed 100 psi,

Offeror’s are required to submit a minimum of three relevant evaluations for similar contracts from Federal, state and local Government.  Surveys will be evaluated to determine relevant experience and service.  PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SURVEY is an attachment to this solicitation (identified as an amendment).

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.

<DESC>Amendment #1          

Technical Questions

QUESTION #1:   Does the EPA have a particular wetland system in mind for the project topic #4: “A greywater study to examine the efficacy of on-site wetland treatment?”  Specifically, if a wetland system has already been identified, where is this wetland located?
ANSWER:  Under this project topic the EPA assumed either any offeror had available or was able to construct a wetland system to perform the task within the time period allotted.  Providing details about the wetland system to be used for treatment and technical expertise, should be included as part of any quotation as part of the technical approach.   

QUESTION #2:  Is there any possibility the quotation deadline could be extended?  
ANSWER:  Yes, the due date for quotations is hereby extended to August 18, 2006 NLT 3:00PM (EST)

QUESTION #3:  The SOW indicates the following: "One order or up to six separate orders can be issued to an offeror.  Additionally, offerors can submit a quote for each individually or any combination of up to all six topics."  The Final reporting manuscript for this project will be either a stand alone final report or a chapter in a compendium report, anticipated to be entitled “Urban Watershed Practices.”  If a quote is submitted for a combination of topics, is it the EPA's intention that the offeror produce a single and separate manuscript and/or a single and separate QAPP for each topic or may multiple topics be integrated into a single manuscript and/or QAPP?
ANSWER:   Each project topic will have a separate manuscript developed.  The manuscript may be one of the following: chapter in a report or a journal article submission.  The intent at the end of the project period is to have a high quality research manuscript that could be used for either or both. 
Additionally, if an offeror is awarded an order for multiple project topics either multiple QAPPs can be submitted or one QAPP that addresses the individual needs of each project topic may be submitted.

QUESTION #4:  The synopsis states, “A QAPP is necessary if the contractor will sample environmental measurements during the project period (Sampling and Analysis Project), use secondary data (Secondary Data Project).”  For quotes that will not sample environmental measurements under this purchase order, but will incorporate data from sample collection and analyses efforts that are ongoing during the project’s period of performance under a pre-existing and approved QAPP, will use/incorporation of the data require a QAPP specific to this project or may an existing and approved QAPP be submitted or referenced to meet the QAPP requirement?
ANSWER:   A QAPP is required for each project.  An existing or previously approved QAPP is not acceptable to meet the QAPP requirement.

QUESTION #5:   This RFQ is identified as a Small Business Set-Aside. Does that mean that a University cannot be the contractor?  If so, can a consultant submit a quote as a small business? 
ANSWER:  As for the Small Business Set Aside requirement question, yes these requirements are 100% small business set-asides.  As for the questions concerning the University and Consultants, in most instances, colleges and universities are not considered small businesses, but this is something that will need to be verified by the offeror.  An offeror can submit a quote as a small business, but the offeror must be registered in CCR or this must be accomplished before an award can be made.  Additionally, see the clause below pertaining to Small Business Set-Aside.   

Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003)

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Physical Capital Asset Management Division (PGE) has a requirement for Market Research, Product Development and Product Evaluation Services in connection with the agency's Market Offerings Division.

The PBS Market Offerings Division is responsible for product/service development and management.  This involves creating new products and/or services to meet demonstrable customer needs-existing as well as anticipated-and evaluating the performance of PBS' existing suite of products and services.  Broad-based market research (i.e., demand planning) and more specific customer input is needed to drive both tasks.

GSA/PBS/PGE intends to award a firm-fixed price contract under the NAICS 541613.  The services will be provided to GSA Central Office in Washington, DC and all eleven (11) Regional Offices throughout the United States.

The services to be provided shall include:

National "voice of the customer" market research on customer wants and needs as relates to the design of new or improved products, services or processes.

National market research on customer-perceived value of these products and services.

Systematic evaluation of PBS' existing products and services, including an analysis of pricing.

Assessment of existing and potential public and private sector competitors to PBS.


All interested contractors must email Ms. Demetria C. Brown at demetria.brown@gsa.gov (no telephone inquiries will be accepted) to request a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) on or before August 11, 2006.



ATTACHMENT NO. 1

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Date:  August 8, 2006

Question #1:  The RFP states that you require an assessment of public and private sector competitors of PBS.  Do you have a list of these competitors and how many competitors would you want to analyze as part of this project?

Answer #1:  We do not have a predetermined list of these competitors.  We do know who some of our competitors are but the task includes assessing who the competitors are.  Therefore, there is no predetermined number of competitors that we want analyzed.

Question #2:  We understand that the research is National i.e., all 11 Regions.  How many customers in each Region do you want to include in the research?  Can you provide an estimate of the number of customers that will be provided upon contract award?   What is the expectation of the number of interviewees and in which locations to achieve a reliable sample?

Answer #2:  It is anticipated that the successful vendor will have some targets for a reliable number of subjects for the proposed market research.  We will then be able to provide customer contact information.  Approximately 300 customers participated in our most recent survey of ordering officials from these two customer segments for all PBS products and services.  It is anticipated that the number of subjects for this specific market research task will be less due to the narrower scope of study on one product line.  Customers are located throughout the United States.

Question #3:  Do we need to have some type of security clearances in place to be qualified for this project?  If so, then what type of clearances and process to get them?  Our understanding is that we do not but might need to get them if we get this project.

Answer #3:  You do not need to have security clearances in place to be qualified for this project.  However, based on the requirements resulting from Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12, the successful vendor and any proposed personnel must be able to return a favorable response to a National Agency Check with Inquiries and Credit (NACIC) background investigation prior to working on the contract.

Question #4:  What is the suggested number of pages for the proposal?  How many pages of attachments can we have?

Answer #4:  The number of pages for the proposal and attachments should be whatever you deem as necessary in order to succinctly present your proposal.

Question #5:  Can you provide an estimate of the number of people involved in the purchasing process in each region?

Answer #5:  PBS has approximately 6000 employees nationwide (FY2004 data).  These employees are spread across 11 regions and headquarters in support of PBS’s mission to provide workspace to federal agencies.

Question #6:  Do task 1A and 1B refer to work place occupancy products only, also?  

Answer #6:  Yes, the focus of this study is on the Workspace Occupancy products outlined in the RFP.

Question #7:  Will you accept, in addition to the outlined pricing proposal, an alternate pricing method in order to save money?

Answer #7:  In order for your response to be considered it must contain the outlined pricing proposal.  Alternate pricing may be considered if firstly the provisions of the outlined pricing proposal have been met. 

Question #8:  What is the range of functional roles of the customer contacts within their respective agencies?  That is, are they senior-level executives, middle-level executives, project managers, professionals, tenants, or other classification, and what is the approximate proportion of each of the roles in the contract lists to be provided?

Answer #8:  This will of course depend on the nature of the successful proposal for conducting the market research however, it is anticipated that accomplishing the market research will require interaction with customers at all levels.

Question #9:  What is the range of relational roles of these customer contacts in regard to the GSA PBS?  That is, are they decision makers, approver, influencers, or users of GSA PBS products and services, and what is the approximate proportion of each of these roles in the contact lists to be provided?

Answer #9:  This also will depend on the nature of the successful proposal for conducting the market research however, it is anticipated that accomplishing the market research will require interaction with customers similar to our ordering officials levels who are all users of PBS products and services as well as being decision makers, approvers, or influencers.  In addition, we have a significant amount of customer satisfaction survey information from tenants as well as ordering officials that will be made available to the successful vendor.

Question #10:  Will the contact information provided include telephone numbers and email addresses?

Answer #10:  Yes

Question #11:  Will the primary research conducted under this RFP be conducted only with the customer contacts provided by the GSA PBS, or will non-customers also be targeted?

Answer #11:  It is anticipated that most of the primary research will be with customers.  However, some primary research with competitors may also be necessary in order to complete the assessment of competitors as stated in task 3 of the RFP.

Question #12:  In regards to the Department of Commerce, will this research target only the Census Bureau, or will other DOC agencies be included?

Answer #12:  Other bureaus of the Department of Commerce, such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Patent and Trademark Administration, International Trade Administration, and the Headquarters will be included.

Question #13:  In regards to the Treasury Department, will this research target only the Internal Revenue Service, or will other Treasury agencies be included?

Answer #13:  Other bureaus of the Treasury Department, such as the Bureau of Public Debt, Office of Financial and Management Service and Headquarters will be included.

Question #14:  Are there customer contacts (or contact levels) for which GSA PBS prefers we provide special treatment- such as the use of introductory letters from senior management of the GSA, telephone calls instead of survey forms, personal meetings instead of telephone calls, etc?

Answer #14:  We are anticipating that PBS will notify all proposed customer participants prior to contact from the successful vendor.  The successful vendor will have an opportunity to review the customer notice to be sent out to ensure it will not impact the research.

Question #15:  Is it the intention of the GSA PBS that deliverable 2 Evaluation of PBS Products and Services also be based, at least in part, on primary research with customers?

Answer #15:  It is anticipated that some level of primary research with customers would have to be conducted in order to accomplish the evaluation of PBS products and services.  The focus is on only the workspace occupancy product line identified in the RFP.

Question #16:  For which of the deliverables (if any) is evaluation and reporting of findings broken down by Region desired?

Answer #16:  It is preferred for the report of findings to be broken down by region and if appropriate the evaluation may be broken down by region.  

As a full-service real estate provider to public and private sector clients, we had a number of questions regarding the tasks identified in the Scope of Work.

Question #17:  If awarded the work outlined in this RFP, would we be precluded from providing other products and services to the GSA or its customers now or in the future?

Answer #17:  All information researched and collected for this project shall be for GSA, Public Buildings Service use only and shall not be sold, marketed, or used for any other purpose unless authorized by the COR.  The Contractor shall be required to sign a Non-Disclosure form and a Conflict of Interest statement upon award.  In addition, any work resulting from this project shall become the property of the U.S. Government.

Question #18:  Given the nature of the services our firm provides, which are similar to those provided by PBS, is there any perception of conflict of interest in the development of findings and recommendations that would comprise our ability to win the work.

Answer #18:  The perception of conflict of interest will be eliminated by a Non-Disclosure form and a Conflict of Interest statement to be signed by the Contractor upon award.  

Question #19:  Similarly, we are on of the “public and private sector competitors” for whom you are requesting an assessment in Scope of Work, item 3 (comparison of products and services and the pricing methodology…utilized for similar products and services).  Given our position, does GSA perceive any conflict of interest in the development of the findings and recommendations requested?

Answer #19:  The perception of conflict of interest will be eliminated by a Non-Disclosure form and a Conflict of Interest statement to be signed by the Contractor upon award.  

GSA alludes to “five segmented customer grouping” of federal client agencies.  We understand that the analysis is limited only to the “Public Access” and “Regulatory” segments.

Question #20:  What are the other three segments?  Have there been any similar assessments for these segments from which lessons learned can be gained?

Answer #19:  The other segments contain our remaining customers and this is the first such assessment of its kind.

Question #21:  The RFP requires submission of two separate volumes, pricing and technical.   The description of the technical proposal, however, references pricing information.  Is it the GSA’s intention for pricing information to be included in the technical proposal, or should pricing be separate?



Answer #21:  The pricing information should be listed separately from the technical proposal however pricing should track back to the separate itemizations contained in the technical proposal.

Question #22:  If short-listed, how much time will contractors be provided to prepare for oral presentations?

Answer #22:  It is our intention to provide a week to prepare for oral presentations however this depends on a number of variables out of our control including the number of responses to this RFP.

PBS portfolio accommodates in excess of one-million employees in more than 100 federal agencies.  As suggested in the RFP, primary research will entail facilitated workshops and evaluation of satisfaction surveys.

Question #23:  Does GSA have any expectations that field employees (the users of space) be surveyed by the contractor, or can we assume that the workshops focus on higher level staff in the field and headquarters?

Answer #23:  We have a significant amount of customer satisfaction data from users of our space as well as from ordering officials for our services.  It is not anticipated that users of our space will need additional surveying.  It is anticipated that the primary research with leadership and ordering officials would focus on the workspace occupancy product line with specific attention to the need for new or redesigned products and the customer-perceived value of our offering in this product line.  Also, as stated in the RFP, this market research is for the two customer segments identified, i.e. Public Access and Regulatory.

Question #24:  Does the GSA expect that primary research (items 1A and 1B of the Description of Services/Tasks – including focus groups and conversations) be conducted with the “Top 10 Customer” groups identified in Appendix B of the RFP or can more or fewer be proposed?

Answer #24:  It is anticipated that primary research will only be conducted with the two customer segments identified in the RFP, i.e. Public Access and Regulatory.

Question #25:  To what extent is there an opportunity to perform focus group sessions that would require participants to travel to a central location to participate in them?

Answer #25:  Focus group sessions will be considered as proposed.  Pricing proposals should include estimates for conducting these focus group sessions.

Question #26:  Can we rely on GSA support in scheduling and communication that is associated with interviews and focus group or should we provide staffing to provide for the need.

Answer #26:  Proposals should include staffing for scheduling and communication associated with interviews and focus groups.  We are anticipating that PBS will notify all proposed customer participants prior to contact from the successful vendor.  The successful vendor will have an opportunity to review the customer notice to be sent out to ensure it will not impact the research.  This is intended to be a notification of this study by PBS to our customers, not a coordinating or scheduling of primary research.

Question #27:    Appendix A states that the “planned Federal Acquisition Service will include seven zones within GSA’s eleven geographic regions.”  Does the GSA expect that the primary research (Items 1a and 1b of the Description of Services/Tasks – including focus groups and conversations) be conducted in each of the eleven geographic regions?  How will the seven zones of the Federal Acquisition Service be defined?

Answer #27:  It is not anticipated that any significant primary research with the Federal Acquisition Service will be required.  The focus is on the PBS workspace occupancy product line and that is delivered by the eleven regions.  We already have a great deal of customer satisfaction research with tenants and ordering officials in all eleven regions and agency leadership.  
GSA indicates that "Task 2" is to focus on "Workspace Occupancy," which includes the following services:  Building operations and maintenance; consultation and coordination for security services; cleaning; solid waste management (incl. recycling); heating and cooling; pest control; landscaping and grounds; tenant alterations; repairs; signage; and, occupant emergency planning services.

Question #28:  Does this mean that “Task 2” is focused exclusively on these services – and those that are incidental to them?  Or is the intention broader (that is, to give primacy to “Workplace Occupancy” but also address other service as a secondary focus)?

Answer #28:  Response:  Yes, as stated in the RFP the scope of work focuses on the Workspace Occupancy products and services as listed in the appendix.  

Question # 29:    Does this mean that “Tasks 1(a) and 1(b), and 3” should also be limited to “Workspace Occupancy” matters?  Or will those tasks be broader and include all other workspace products and services (such as “Workspace Environment Options,” “Real Property Disposal Options,” and, “Utilization Options”) as well as additional products and services (such as “Outleasing and Retail,” “Energy Management,” etc.)?

Answer #29:  As stated in the RFP the scope of work focuses on the Workspace Occupancy products and services as listed in the appendix.

Question #30:  For associated primary research activities, is there guidance on the desired amount of face-to-face communication and associated travel (versus obtaining information from telephone conversations/interviews)?

Answer #30:  Proposals should address the level and type of communication proposed by the vendor to accomplish the tasks. 

Question #31:  In line with the above question, the RFP states that work shall be performed at the 
Contractor’s location, at PBS’s Central office, at customer sites in the Washington DC area, and at regional offices.  What is the expectation for actual time spent “on-site?”

Answer #31:  The Contractor’s proposal should address this issue in order to accomplish the tasks.  

Question #32:  The RFP states that a list of customer contacts will be provided.  Will multiple contacts be provided for each customer? For example, will one contact at the Small Business Administration be equipped to answer pertinent questions and discuss key elements or will there be multiple contacts at multiple facilities/buildings within that agency? 

Answer #32:  The number of customer contacts will vary from one customer to another.  It is anticipated that the successful Contractor’s proposal will have some targets for a reliable number of subjects for the proposed market research.  Based on that we will then be able to provide customer contact information.  

Question #33:   What is the approximate number of buildings that would be included in the assessment?  What level of detail will GSA provide on these buildings and in what format?

Answer #33:  This RFP is not an assessment of our buildings.  We do not anticipate providing details on our building inventory.  

Question #34:  Is there a requirement for protecting sensitive information gained through this project (business sensitive, Official Use Only, etc.)?

Answer #34:  Yes.  All information researched and collected for this project shall be for GSA, Public Buildings Service use only and shall not be sold, marketed, or used for any other purpose unless authorized by the COR.  The Contractor shall be required to sign a Non-Disclosure form and a Conflict of Interest statement upon award.  In addition, any work resulting from this project shall become the property of the U.S. Government.

Question #35:   What is the mailing address for submitting a hard copy of the proposal? 

Answer #35:  1800 F Street, NW, Room 4302, Washington, D.C. 20405-0002

Question #36:  Does PBS have past research?  If so, can we see it?

Answer #36:  PBS does not have previous market research on this subject.

Question #37:   What are the perceived problems with the current products and services?  From customer feedback as well as from PBS management viewpoint/perceptions?

Answer #37:  It is anticipated that the response to this question would be one of the results of the successful performance of the contract.

Question #38:  Does PBS have a current list of potential new products/services they are considering offering?  If so, what are they?

Answer #38:  This information is confidential and will not be released.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted and to incorporate a technical change into the solicitation.

The due date for quotations, 3:30 PM Local Time on August 16, 2006, remains unchanged.

1.  Responses are hereby provided to technical questions submitted.

QUESTION: Line Item 0001, Specification (b) : Please provide more specific details of what is required.  Does this means you are looking for two measurement volumes 25mm x 25mm and 100mm x 100mm?  Does the distance from the part need to be 50mm or is the height of the part 50mm?  What does 10mm minimum mean?
RESPONSE:  NIST is looking for one measurement volume that is between 25mm x 25mm x10mm and 100mmx100mmx100mm.  The parts we are measuring will have heights up to 10mm.

QUESTION:  Line Item 0001, Specification (c):  Please explain what is meant by "Not less than 6 views".
RESPONSE:  Placement of cameras and projectors must allow at least 6 viewing angles.  For example, if there are 2 fixed cameras, then there should be at least 3 different positions for the projector.  This would allow two images each of three different projections, equaling 6 views.

QUESTION:   Line Item 0001, Specification (e): Across what distance? How many standard deviations?
RESPONSE:  Measurement uncertainty is the standard deviation of measurements.  Number of tests used to obtain this standard deviation, along with the measurement size must be reported.  At least 10 measurements with a measurements size of 10mm x10mm is advisable, but not required.

QUESTION: Line Item 0001, Specification (f):  Across what distance?  How many standard deviations?
RESPONSE:  Spacing of spheres must be at least 10mm.  Results must be reported with measurement uncertainty (i.e. one standard deviation.  The length deviation should be "less than 15 micrometers". 
	Reference specification change below.

QUESTION:  Line Item 0001, (h) seems to contradict (d).  If the camera pixel spacing meets the requirement in (d), why is a 1392 x 1040 camera required?
RESPONSE:  This is not contradictory to d.  1392 x 1040 camera (or better) must have pixel spacing less than 5 micrometers.

QUESTION:  Line Item 0001, Specification (i): Why is a digital projector with three sinusoidal images a requirement?  This appears to be a specification defined by a supplier which provides no technical advantage other than to lock superior systems out of the bidding process.
RESPONSE:  This is a requirement to allow flexibility in the types of patterns NIST will be able to project.  It by no means attempts to "lock superior systems out of the bidding process".

2.  The following technical change is hereby incorporated:
Line Item 0001, Specification (e) is hereby changed as follows:
	FROM: Measurement uncertainty: Less than 5 micrometers;…
	TO:   Measurement uncertainty: Less than 15 micrometers;…

<SUBJECT>X -- Warehouse Storage
<SOLNBR>VLC6MRQ0012A
<RESPDATE>081106
<ARCHDATE>08262006
<CONTACT>Tracy Miller, Contract Specialist, Phone 202353-3772, Fax 202-514-3353, Email tracy.c.miller@dhs.gov
<DESC>Questions submitted:

1. As published on the web at Fed Bus Ops, there are two (2) documents, 1. the Combined Solicitation and 2. Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. A review of these documents indicates that they are identical. What is the purpose of the amendment?

The first amendment was submitted to show the change in the date and time for question deadlines and the change in time and date for the closing of the announcement. 

 2. CLIN 1001, 2001 and 3001 indicate "(OPTION)". We assume that you are referring to option years 1,  2 and 3, although that is not indicated in the item (CLIN).

The Option year was indicated under each CLIN. 

3. Paragraph (vi) indicates a requirement for pick up and delivery on an as needed basis, i.e. indefinite  delivery, indefinite quantity, however, a CLIN is not provided for these services. As this solicitation does not specify a specific number of pickups and deliveries per month, a CLIN should be provided for these services, as they cannot be included in the CLINs for the storage space.

Although this number is on a solid number, over the last year the average 4 to 6 times per month. (see amendment two for the adding of this CLIN)

 4. Likewise, since warehouse handling of the items into and out of the warehouse will be required, a CLIN should be provided for warehouse handling.

Please refer to amendment two for the adding of this CLIN

5. The last sentence of paragraph (vi) states, "Palletized storage is not acceptable.", (emphasis added). Since palletized storage, the placing of the wrapped stored items into a closed container, provides much superior protection than does just sitting the items out on a concrete floor, we do not understand this prohibition.  The palletization of household goods (furniture) and office furniture is a standard within the industry. Please explain why this is not acceptable.

The equipment is not your standard office desks and chairs, but rather different pieces that create a workstation.  If items are palletized and a certain piece is needed, items would have to be unwrapped and unpellatized quite often.  Each separate project requires any one of several hundred pieces to be put together to make a workspace.  Storage on shelving is more feasible due to accessibility to equipment.

 6. A review of the solicitation does not reveal a stated liability of the warehouseman. Do you intent to carry your own liability coverage for loss or damage or do you want coverage at one of the warehouseman's available coverage’s? The warehouseman can provide coverage at 60¢ per pound per article, $1.25 per pound per article, full value-depreciated or full replacement value. What is the warehouseman's liability?
The liability will be provided by the vendor.  The warehouse's liability will equal the cost of the equipment/furniture that is being stored. This determination is calculated by the Inventory System that will be in place for this equipment/storage.
k.  Delivery shall be made between 24 – hours up to one week of notification. No holiday or weekend service is required.  Hours of operation shall be 7am to 5pm Monday through Friday.  Palletized storage is not acceptable. (vii) The term of the contract will be one year from the date of award with an option to extend an additional three one-year periods.   Place of performance:  within a 5-mile radius of 188 Harvest Lane Williston, VT 05495. FOB Destination (viii)  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  The following addenda have been attached to this provision:  None.
