However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
