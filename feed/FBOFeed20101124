<DESC>The Agriculture Research Service, USMARC, in Clay Center, NE, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures with BioTeam, Inc., 7 Derosler Drive, Middleton, MA 01949, for the customization of a WikiLIMS - a wiki-based laboratory information management system. The project involves the development of a WikiLIMS for managing and integrating data and metadata (including sample provenance and output from bioanalytical instrumentation) associated with samples to be sequenced on Roche 454 and PacBio DNA sequencers, creating microbial genome assemblies from the output of the sequencers, and automatically annotating and submitting these assembled annotated microbial genomes to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank in a form acceptable for inclusion into their public database. The system shall be built upon open source components such that the code can be used, modified or enhanced by ARS without permission or the purchase of software licenses. The contractor must demonstrate experience designing laboratory information systems that support state-of-the-art DNA sequencing in a research environment. Specials skills and experience required include custom specification and integration of hardware and software for running bioinformatic applications on in-house distributed resource management systems (e.g Oracle Grid Engine, Condor, Platform LSF) or on cloud based systems such as the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) should these resources be required for genome assembly and annotation.  The contractor shall install the WikiLIMS, customize the system as specified for managing genomic research projects, creating forms, and train staff on its use and customizations. Additional modifications to accommodate future experimental designs and alternative types of data may be required on an optional basis. BioTeam is considered a unique source in that the firm developed the WikiLIMS for the US Navy and Environmental Protection Agency, and is most familiar with the existing code for customizing it to meet ARS needs. Additionally, the firm is a Pacific Biosciences Devnet partner and possesses the necessary experience and science/IT capability required to install, modify, and extend the WikiLIMS code as required by ARS.
<p>The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competitin is FAR 13.106-1(b), only one source reasonable available and no other supplies or service will satisfy Agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519, with a small business size standard of $25.0 million, is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  This is a  best value procurement and the criteria will be price, technically acceptable, past performance.  Interested parties who can meet the above requrements may submit written qualifications fully explaining there capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) plans to issue a Request for Quotes (RFQ) forThermal Protection Systems (TPS) materials (Round 2, Phase 1) for the Mars Entry,Descent, and Landing (EDL) Technology Development Project (TDP).In October 2009, NASAs Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) established theEDL TDP, to be managed programmatically at Langley Research Center (LaRC) and technicallyat ARC.  The purpose of the project is to further the technologies required to land heavy(~40 metric ton) masses on Mars to facilitate exploration.  The EDL TDP contains fourtechnical elements.  They are 1) Flexible Deployable Thermal Protection Systems (F-TPS)development; 2) Modeling and Tools (MAT) development; 3) Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP)development; and 4) Rigid Thermal Protection Systems (R-TPS).  The primary goals of theEDL TDP TPS elements are to design and develop TPS materials capable of withstanding thesevere aerothermal loads associated with aerocapture and entry into the Martianatmosphere while significantly decreasing the TPS mass fraction contribution to the entrysystem on either a flexible, deployable system or a rigid system.  Significantadvancements in flexible and rigid ablative TPS materials technology are needed in orderto enable heavy mass payloads to be successfully landed on the Martian surface forrobotic precursor and subsequent human exploration missions.  In February 2010 NASA released Request for Quotations (RFQ) # NNA10323994Q for EDL TDPTPS materials for NASA testing.  As a result of that RFQ, four non-commercial, firm fixedprice purchase orders were awarded to four vendors.  That round of testing will bereferred to as Round 1, Phase 1.  TPS materials were delivered to NASA, and testing ofthose Phase 1 materials is now complete.  Depending upon NASA resources, a down-selectionprocess may occur to select some of those materials for Round 1, Phase 2 NASA testing inearly 2011.For Round 2, Phase 1, the subject of this synopsis, NASA intends to conduct another roundof Phase 1 testing of promising EDL TDP TPS materials that could ultimately meet thestringent requirements for Mars aerocapture and entry.	This procurement will consist ofscreening tests of multiple flexible and rigid ablative TPS materials from multiplevendors within a detailed trade study framework in order to advance promising concepts toTechnology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or 6 by 2014.  All TPS vendors with materials thatmeet the requirements of the Statement of Work are eligible to submit a proposal forRound 2, Phase 1, including, but not limited to:  vendors that submitted a proposal butwere not selected for Round 1, Phase 1; vendors that participated in Round 1, Phase 1 andhave subsequently modified their Phase 1 TPS material; or new vendors who did notparticipate in the Round 1, Phase 1 procurement.NASA plans that Round 1 and Round 2 (and perhaps additional Rounds) will be conducted inparallel, each having several down-selection phases, culminating in a final merging ofall late-phase rounds to select the most appropriate flexible and rigid ablative TPSmaterials required for NASA missions.For Round 2, NASA intends to conduct a Phased Acquisition Using Down-Selection Proceduresin accordance with NASA FAR Subpart (NFS) 1817.73 Phased Acquisitions.	Thispresolicitation notice constitutes the required synopsis for Round 2, Phase 1.	Theformal solicitation is expected to be released to industry in mid-December 2010.  To beconsidered for a Round 2, Phase 1 award, offerors will demonstrate capability to performall phases of this Procurement.In accordance with NFS 1817.7301-4(a) Synopsis, the following information applies to thisphased acquisition process:(1) For Round 2, the Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving acompetitive down-selection process, as follows:Round 2, Phase 1 is for delivery of TPS material coupons that will be described in theStatement of Work  Round 2, Phase 1, to be posted with the solicitation.  NASA willperform a variety of tests on these submitted coupons, and results of the testing will beevaluated as part of the down-selection to Round 2, Phase 2.Round 2, Phase 2 is planned for continued testing, development, and extending the TRL forrigid ablator materials and deployable ablator materials.  The down-selection to Round 2,Phase 2 is expected to be late FY2011.Round 2, Phase 3 is planned for continued development and further characterization ofrigid ablator and deployable ablator materials.  The down-selection to Round 2, Phase 3is expected to be about FY2012.Round 2, Phase 4 is expected to culminate in FY2014 with a final merging of alllate-phase rounds to select the most appropriate flexible and rigid ablative TPSmaterials required for NASA missions.(2) Competitions for subsequent phases of Round 2 will build on the results of previousphases.(3) The award criteria for subsequent phases of Round 2 will include demonstratedcompletion of specified previous phase requirements.(4) The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors of Round 2 will becapable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s). Proposals for thesubsequent phase(s) will be requested from these contractors.(5) The Government intends to issue a new, formal solicitation for subsequent phases ofRound 2. (6) Each subsequent phase of the Round 2 acquisition will be synopsized in accordancewith FAR 5.201 and 5.203. (7) Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase Round 2 contractors willbe capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s), proposals from allresponsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered.  In order tocontend for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective offerors must demonstratea design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase contractors.  Failure to fullyand completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render theproposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.(8) Each subsequent synopsis during this Round 2 process will identify the current phasecontractors.This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).NASA/ARC is planning to award multiple non-commercial purchase orders for Round 2, Phase1.  The Round 2, Phase 1 procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13,Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Depending upon NASA resouces, later phases areexpected to include more complex requirements, may have higher contract values, withlonger periods of performances, and may be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15,Contracting by Negotiation.The tentative TPS for MARS EDL Round 2, Phase 1 schedule is:  Issuance of Synopsis  November 24, 2010;  Issuance of RFQ# NNA11366031Q  mid December 2010; Proposals Due  15 days following issuance of solicitation;  Multiple Purchase Orders awarded early-mid January 2011.All contractual and/or technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mailpreferred) by 4:00 pm Pacific Time, December 9, 2010.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for assistance and technical services to aid in theintegration of new requirements for the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System(SERVIR), further progression of SERVIR from installation to operations in East Africa,installation of SERVIR in the Himalayas, and potential expansion to other geographicalregions.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Science Systems and Applications, Inc(SSAI).  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1. The funds specifically dedicated to establish and expand the SERVIR system in Africaand other geographic regions, were provided to NASA from the United States Agency forInternational Development (USAID) under a Participating Agency Program Agreement. Therequirements and timeframe which have been levied on NASA by USAID necessitate immediateimplementation; thus, the need to use existing system familiarity and expertise isvirtually unavoidable.	SSAI is currently providing technical support for the SERVIRsystem in Africa and has key personnel with nearly 20 years experience in the processing,analysis, management and delivery of multi-source environmental data.2. Advancement of the SERVIR integrated platform is one of the projects highestpriorities. SSAI having been the implementing arm for development of the SERVIRinfrastructure, which includes the integrated platform, brings system familiarity anddesign consistency along with the required expertise readily available to implementrelevant tasks within the time constraint specified in the interagency agreement betweenNASA and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), NASAs fundingpartner for global expansion. Continuing to engage SSAI lessens the risk of failure toimplement requirements per the guidelines set by USAID, which incidentally keeps NASA ingood standing with the USAID and promotes future collaboration.3. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also themodel in the Americas for the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinationaleffort to build an earth observation system.  It is also a key implementation projectunder the Central American-United States Joint Accord signed by U.S. Secretary of StateColin Powell on June 7, 2001. For these reasons, it is of benefit to NASA to maintain itsaffiliation with an institution like SSAI that is well recognized in the geospatialcommunity and consistently performs exceptionally well amid the high demands that go handin hand with high-visibility.4. SSAI has existing relationships with SERVIRs international partners, the Water Centerfor the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC), which hosts andoperates the SERVIR system in Mesoamerica, and the Regional Center for Mapping ofResources for Development (RCMRD) which hosts and operates the SERVIR system in EastAfrica. These existing relationships will help facilitate the transfer of technology tothe newly dedicated third SERVIR system in the Himalayas.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon Wednesday, December 8, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board has developed a new framework for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) writing assessment which calls for an entirely computer-based administration of the assessment in 2011 for grades 8 and 12 and in 2013 for grade 4. Preliminary achievement levels descriptions were developed as part of the Writing 2011 Framework development project.
<p><br />The Governing Board requires expert evaluation of the preliminary descriptions, as well as a review of the achievement levels descriptions currently used for reporting writing NAEP results in order to develop final descriptions to use in the achievement levels setting process. The new achievement levels descriptions will be presented to the Governing Board for adoption in May 2011 as the achievement levels descriptions to be used for reporting results of the writing NAEP for 2011 and thereafter. <br /><br />The overall objective of the procurement is to develop achievement levels descriptions to be used for reporting the results of the 2011 NAEP for grades 8 and 12 and the 2013 NAEP for grade 4. A statement of objectives will be issued for which a proposed methodology and procedure for developing the achievement levels descriptions shall be prepared. The procedure must at minimum include a plan to draft the achievement levels descriptions, a plan to submit them to broad-based review, vetting by various stakeholders of NAEP and writing, revisions in response to the reviews, and finalizing the descriptions for submission to the Governing Board for approval.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued as a Simplified Acquisition under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, and is planned as total small business set aside contract. The RFP will be issued in late December 2010 or early January 2011. Responses to the RFP will be due approximately 30-45 days after the RFP release.</p>
<p>Questions on this announcement and the RFP shall be submitted after RFP release, on a date specified in the RFP, in order to provide an opportunity for interested parties to review the RFP and submit all solicitation questions at one time.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to issue a solicitation on a sole source basis to Harlan Laboratories, Inc., entitled "Continuation of the Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Hybrid Rats ". The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 for these services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>The purpose of this contract is to continue services currently being provided by Harlan Laboratories under contract HHSN-260-2005-00006C. The Contractor shall continue to maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony of hybrid rats is required to be maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.</p>
<p>Development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase took approximately three (3) years. After the breeding colony was up to its required size to provide the requisite entry levels into the restricted colony, animals were entered into the aging colony so that there is a continuous supply available. The research funded by the NIA requires a consistent supply of hybrid rats and three or more year gap in availability of the animals would have a serious effect on NIA-funded studies. Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the aging colony, a responsible source would need to detail the existence of a similar colony of aged BN and F344BN F1 rats currently available for NIA utilization.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor is uniquely qualified to perform these services for the NIA based on the following considerations:</p>
<p>Harlan Laboratories has provided all the services required to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged BN and F344BN F1 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. Harlan Laboratories houses these rodents in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For these reasons, the existing colony cannot be transferred to a new Contractor.</p>
<p>This solicitation was previously advertised under sources sought announcement HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-148.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is three years.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important notes:</p>

<DESC><br />The National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to issue a solicitation on a sole source basis to Taconic Farms Inc, entitled "Continuation of the Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term F-344 Rat Colony".

<p><br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to continue services currently being provided by Taconic Farms, Inc under contract number HHS-N-260-2004-0008. The Contractor has developed, maintained and distributed a standing colony of aged F344 rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This animal colony has been divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment is maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier also has an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power. Each colony segment should continuously be maintained solely within its barrier facility without intermingling.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor.

<p>The purpose of this contract is to continue services currently being provided by Taconic Farms, Inc under contract number HHS-N-260-2004-0009. The contractor has developed, maintained and distributes a standing colony of aged mutant mice of defined genotypes, including genetically engineered and spontaneously arising mutations, for use by investigators in studies of aging. The word &lsquo;mutant' is used here to refer to transgenic, knockout and spontaneously arising mutant genotypes. This colony has been developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity. Each line of mice will be characterized for the specific mutation and control animals will be provided for some lines where needed.</p>
<p>Four lines were obtained and it is estimated that between 300 and 600 mice per year will be entered into the aging colony for each line.</p>

<p><br />Animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators, such that young animals enter the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The colony shall continue to be maintained behind two independent barriers, specific pathogen- and parasite- free, for the entire contract period. The two barriers do not need to be geographically separated. Both barriers shall specifically be helicobacter-negative. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, genetic contamination, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock.

<DESC><br />Synopsis<br />Title: MV-22 Cabin Part Task Trainer (MVCPTT)
<p>1) Requirement: Unrestricted Competition<br />The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, has a requirement to provide training solutions that satisfy the MVCPTT training requirements.</p>
<p>The primary effort includes implementing a systems approach to training, analyzing requirements, producing, delivering, and installing one MVCPTT at MCAS New River, NC. The requirement also includes a brief support period following delivery.</p>
<p>The MVCPTT is a new device, based on the United States Marine Corps' requirements to train MV-22 aircrew personnel for events not practical for training utilizing flyable aircraft. The MVCPTT is intended to be built using an existing MV-22 aircraft fuselage (BUNO 166389) as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) located at MCAS New River, NC. The Government will provide limited, existing available drawings and data following contract award. The planned configuration of the MVCPPT will include a mobile MV-22 Block B fuselage, and an external Instructor/Operator Station.</p>
<p>Electrical power for the device will be supplied by the Government facility. The MVCPTT will be designed to perform the following tasks according to the aircraft Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) manual and Training and Readiness (T&amp;R) manual (it will not use explosives to disengage escape windows/hatches):</p>
<p>1. Cargo Loading <br />2. Emergency Egress (Pilot and Enlisted Aircrew) <br />3. Troop Carrying Configuration<br />4. Auxiliary Fuel Tank Configuration<br />5. Medivac (Litter) Configuration<br />6. Rescue Hoist Operation<br />7. Ground Refueling/Defueling Simulation<br />8. Hydraulic System Servicing<br />9. Emergency Equipment Operation<br />10. Fast Rope Operation<br />11. Night Vision Training <br />12. Ramp Mounted Gun Setup</p>
<p>Simulation of components may be done, but all visible and functional components will conform to the fidelity requirements identified in the Specification. The MVCPTT computer control system may operate independently of the aircraft avionics bus system. However, intercom and audio cues will simulate actual aircraft operation.</p>
<p>Final delivery of the completed MVCPTT at MCAS New River, NC, is expected to take no more than two (2) years from the contract award date. A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>Draft versions of the Statement of Work (SOW), Specification, and a list of the Government Furnished Equipment is attached to this notice. Additionally, a secondary notice is released at the NAWCTSD Business Opportunities site at http://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm.

The program seeks to maximize the financial value of the properties and leverage that value with private sector expertise to offset the cost of ongoing operations or obviate the need for capital investments.  The Navy is seeking Contractor assistance to support this effort.  If solicited, the contract could consist of two phases.
 The tasks under Phase 1 entail developing analyses of potential sites, the scoring and ranking of potential sites, and preparing Economic/Market Analysis Feasibility Studies.

The Navy and Marine Corps EUL program will encompass Continental United States (CONUS) Navy and Marine Corps Installations including Hawaii and Guam.
  There will be multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies occurring simultaneously for Navy and Marine Corps Installations in various CONUS geographical areas including Hawaii and Guam.  Tasks for Industry Forums will be planned, coordinated, and hosted to establish a framework for disseminating information on the EUL program among Navy and Marine Corps stakeholders and developers from private industry.  The Industry Forum tasks will be hosted in various geographical areas within CONUS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>AIRCRAFT FUEL SEALANT CURING ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<BR><BR>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on fuel sealant curing technologies that have already been developed or may be modified from other Aerospace Industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below:<BR><BR>AATC is conducting an effort to determine potential sources for alternative methods to decrease curing times of fuel cell sealant and increase aircraft availability in Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) F-16C, C-130, F-15, KC-135, C-20, C-5, and A-10 aircraft.  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a request for proposal.  <BR><BR>AATC is seeking contractors interested in providing affordable aircraft fuel cell sealant curing enhancement systems that use the latest commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology as part of an operational test and evaluation (OT&E) effort.  The curing enhancement system should be a variation of electrical, heat, infra-red (IR), or other proven concepts.  AATC prefers submissions that have already been through FAA certification or a similar process.  Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding.  The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost; however, affordability is the most important factor.<BR><BR>Fuel Cell Sealant Curing System Requirements:  System must be currently certified intrinsically safe. System should be able to be set up quickly and easily by trained USAF maintenance personnel.  System should be easily transportable and have minimal or no calibration requirements.  System should not alter the chemical properties of the sealant.  <BR><BR>Interested parties capable of providing this aircraft fuel cell sealant curing enhancement system that meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a statement of capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system, along with a description of system capabilities.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify the system capability as related to the technical effort requested.  A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses, which should be received by close of business 12 January 2011.  Testing results are expected to determine the most effective system.  <BR> <BR>Please e-mail all Information and SOC to the Contracting Officer, SMSgt Jon Ransom, at jon.ransom@ang.af.mil.  For programmatic questions or technical questions contact Maj Russ DeWald at (520) 295-6955 or Maj Sheldon Brown at (520) 295-6960.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this synopsis.

Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  <BR>Description of Services:<BR>1.	BACKGROUND: Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) and Fully Medically Ready (FMR) are the basic principles of force-sustainment for Massachusetts Army National Guard (MAARNG) forces.  Medical and dental health is vital for force health protection and failure to achieve and maintain a standard of medical and oral health could preclude a soldier from deploying.  Medical and Dental Readiness is a command responsibility. This Sources Sought is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Agreement for one (1) base year and two (3) option years and covers the various components of Medical and Dental Readiness. The SOW identifies the purpose of the work to be performed by the contractor and provides a description of work to be completed and any required outcomes. The contractor shall provide qualified personnel and required equipment and materials to perform the services at site to be determined throughout the state of Massachusetts and be capable of providing OSHA, HIPAA, ADA and Privacy Act Compliant Mobile, Self-Contained, Medical/Dental/Hearing Practices depending on the individual site needs for the MAARNG.<BR><BR>This Statement of Work for Health Care Services covers the various components of IMR/FMR to include: <BR><BR>A.	Dental  - Annual dental exams, digital bitewing x-rays, digital panoramic x-rays, real-time or near real-time DENCLASS data entry of all x-rays and dental records, identification and on-site treatment of all eligible Class 3 soldiers to convert to Class 2 or better, per National Guard Bureau (NGB) guidance.<BR><BR>B.	Medical - Periodic Health Assessments (PHAs), Soldier Readiness Programs (SRPs) Specialty Physical Exams required per AR 40-501 including Chapter 2 (schools and accession physicals), "over-40" physicals and age specific testing requirements, Flight physicals, women's health requirements, laboratory and phlebotomy work such as HIV, pregnancy testing, PAP smear, DNA, G6PD, Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR), PSA, urine and other blood tests, immunizations required for Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) / Fully Medically Ready (FMR) and theater specific compliance such as Hepatitis A/B, Influenza (to include H1N1) and Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) also known as Tuberculin Skin Tests, visual acuity and Optometry exams, DOEHRS compatible audiometric exams and SPRINT testing, real-time MEDPROS entry and update of all applicable and appropriate IMR/FMR functions.   Services are to be completed on site throughout Massachusetts.   <BR><BR>Department of Defense established a uniform dental classification in HA Policy 02-11.  Department of Defense policy requires dental screening examinations to be accomplished and documented on 90% of service members.  Members of the Army National Guard shall receive an annual dental screening examination to determine their dental classification.  As well, Soldiers alerted and on Mobilization Orders are eligible for Dental Treatment if they result in a Class 3 Status from examination.  For Class 3 soldiers, the results of that screening examination shall be entered into the DENCLASS database immediately in order to allow the State Dental Officer to approve a treatment plans.  For all others, the results of the examination shall be entered into the DENCLASS database within 5 days from the date of examination.  The DENCLASS database updates the Army Medical Protection System (MEDPROS).  Dental treatment that may be required is essential to be provided at the Soldier Readiness Process (SRP) site to ensure the highest dental deployment rate for the mobilizing Soldiers.<BR><BR>Department of The Army established a requirement for a routine, annual Periodic Health Assessment (PHA) to be conducted for all members of the Active Duty and the Selected Reserves.  This program focuses on optimizing the health and wellness of Soldiers.  It includes  a self-reported health status of each Soldier, an update of DD Form 2766 Adult Preventive Care Flow sheet and the IMR portion of MEDPROS to update current medical conditions, medications, required immunizations, readiness labs, audiology and optometry exams; screening and patient education for stress, alcohol and tobacco use; and referrals for age and gender appropriate screening exams IAW the US Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations  A Military doctor will review the questionnaire and all medical files, issue a permanent PULHES and profile if necessary, and determine the Soldier's deployability within 6 months.  All information will be recorded into necessary medical files and approved MAARNG web-based modules (MEDPROS and DENCLASS) in real time, but not later than 5 days after an event.<BR><BR><BR>2.	OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE: The objective of this Statement of Work is to conduct and complete the requirements of the MAARNG IMR/FMR - Medical & Dental Readiness on all eligible Service Members (SMs) in the MAARNG utilizing a HIPAA, Privacy Act, and OSHA-Compliant, Mobile Health/Dental Practice.  Medical services will be performed by licensed medical professionals with oversight by the MAARNG, Office of the State Army Surgeon.  As well, SMs in the MAARNG that are Class 3 Dental Status (non-deployable without approved dental treatment) require an OSHA & ADA-Compliant mobile dental facility.  These requirements include:<BR><BR>A.	Estimated Workload-Contractor shall be prepared to see an average of 250 to 500 SM's will be in attendance at each event  for IMR exams.  For planning purposes, estimate 5% Female, 1% over 40 female, 10% over 40 male, and 40% dental Class 3 requiring on-site treatment.<BR><BR>B.	The Contractor can expect that all blood draws and women's health testing will take place the first day of the event, normally starting Not Later Than (NLT) 0700 but determined by the MAARNG per event.  A tracking spreadsheet shall be maintained daily for all lab testing, by type.<BR><BR>C.

<DESC>Background:  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans to renew the Cardiovascular Health Study  Core Support contract to maintain the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) organization and resources for ongoing and future epidemiologic research in cardiovascular disease and other relevant topics in older adults.  The CHS is a multi-center longitudinal study of risk factors for development and progression of cardiovascular disease and stroke in men and women ages 65 and older (see www.chs-nhlbi.org).  Previous NHLBI contracts supported collection of data, blood and urine samples, and DNA from 5,888 CHS participants during 10 annual examinations during the period 1989-1999 and semi-annual phone calls through May 2005.  A transition phase contract awarded in 2005 and renewed in 2008 has provided support for core study functions, while investigator-initiated grants and other sources that fund CHS research projects provide the balance of support.   The research projects expand the CHS enterprise by submitting periodic updates of cohort members vital status, validated clinical events of interest, and other newly collected data for incorporation into the main CHS data set maintained by the core support contract.  Results from these ancillary studies are disseminated in accordance with CHS policies via presentations at scientific conferences and publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  More than 700 CHS papers have been published to date and approximately 35 independently funded ancillary studies are currently active.  

Purpose and Objectives:  The goal of the proposed project is to maximize scientific yield from NHLBIs past investment in this highly productive study.  The specific objectives are to facilitate continued access to study resources and expertise by investigators new to CHS; promote ongoing and future scientific productivity, collaboration, and mentorship of junior investigators; provide direction and analytic support to existing CHS working groups; and facilitate establishment of a new health services research working group.

Provide a dashboard to support use of the data collected and information produced (including attack paths, prioritized actions, change analyses, what-if analyses, and data problems) by the appropriate people in the organization. Identifies steps that can most efficiently reduce the attack surface, listing the weaknesses to be fixed in priority order for remediation.<br />b. Information in the dashboard is timely, and the vendor's product is scalable to process data on large Federal networks in a reasonable time.<br />c. Information in the dashboard is targeted (to provide the right information to each potential user group) without information overload. It should intuitively enable non-technical staff to know what to do.<br />d. Information in the dashboard in the dashboard is scored (prioritized) using a flexible scheme that accommodates the kind of scoring currently used by DoS and alternates being developed by NSA.<br /><br /><br />4. Integration and Information Management <br /><br />a. Information in the dashboard should serve to potentially replace a trouble ticket system for tracking the specific items (actions) covered (recommended) by this dashboard. <br />b. Extra credit will be given to products which can be traced to "trouble ticket" systems.<br />c. Has a mechanism to safely provide transfer of recommended actions and scoring to a dashboard in a less secure domain (for example, with recommendations and "scores" but without attack paths.<br />d. Maintains data and recommendations in an open architecture that allows flexible and customizable analysis/reporting.<br />e. Provide adequate documentation of processes, analyses, conclusions, recommendations, scores, and results to assure auditors of the effective management of business risk. <br /><br /><br />5. All vendors should feel free to include a narrative of any other features that your product offers (that does not map directly to the capabilities outlined above) that you think the government should consider. Please also advise the government if you believe that any of the above capabilities would unfairly limit competition.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Astoria-Pacific International for a Post-Warranty Service Contract on the existing Astoria 2 Analyzers and FASPac II Operating System. The Government intends to award a contract for a base year and three option years.
<p>TTB's mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance. <br />The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's Lab had previously acquired the Astoria lab equipment, and now has a requirement for post-warranty service. This service is critical to the mission, as there is a need for uninterrupted use and operation of these analyzers and operating system. A sole source to Astoria-Pacific is intended for this order, based on the fact that they are the manufacturer of the equipment and supplier of the parts and service and that there are no authorized resellers for their systems. No other known source has these capabilities. <br /><br />A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Astoria-Pacific. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Agilent Technologies, Inc. for a Service Contract for existing Agilent equipment located in the Beltsville, Maryland and Walnut Creek, California labs. The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year and two option years.
<p>The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's Labs had previously acquired the Agilent instrument systems and now have a requirement for a service contract to maintain these systems. A sole source to Agilent Technologies, Inc. is intended for this order, based on the fact that Agilent is the sole supplier of Agilent's Proprietary software updates and hardware components for these sophisticated systems. Agilent also has the authorized technical staff with the familiarity, expertise and capability of repairing and servicing the current Agilent analytical equipment systems.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Agilent Technologies, Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<p><br />The Consortium for Ocean Leadership, with funding from the National Science Foundation, is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) instruments and related services to support the objective of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). The OOI will construct a networked infrastructure of oceanic sensor systems to measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor. The measurement of temperature, conductivity, and pressure from which salinity and density of ocean water can be calculated is vital to our understanding of many of the crucial scientific questions to which the OOI can provide answers.</p>
<p>The selected firm will provide approximately 350 CTDs of 8 different types for deployment on fixed platforms at OOI arrays. The OOI intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is seeking firms who are interested in submitting a proposal for the CTDs. Ocean Leadership is the only point of contact for this procurement.</p>
<p>Email a signed offer/proposal in PDF format by 4PM EST on December 6, 2010, to RFP1410-00001@oceanleadership.org with the subject line "CTD RFP." Mail one signed original, four copies, and two electronic copies of each proposal volume on CDs, which can be received after the closing date to the following address: <br />Jeanine Hubler, CFCM<br />Director of Contracts and Grants<br />The Consortium for Ocean Leadership <br />1201 New York Ave, NW, Suite 400<br />Washington, DC 20005</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This modification is issued to address Questions submitted prior to deadline:Questions: 1.       What is the recommended distance between data loggers. Answer: Distance between the data loggers should be sufficient to document changes in the river due to tributary inputs and groundtruth TIR imagery.  
2.       You have changes the requirement to TIR Georefferenced images instead of a TIR Mosaic, would you accept a TIR Georectified Mosiac? Answer: Yes.
3.       Your requirement for 1-5 meter TIR resolution will have problems in reading the Temperature in most of the creeks. Even if we provide a 1m resolution, while reading a 1m length creek we will have problems in measuring the temperature as it will represent water and ground (representing different temperatures) in a single pixel.  Based on available technologies we recommend to change the required TIR resolution to at least half of the length of the measured flow, in this case we should plan for a TIR resolution of 0.35cm.   Answer: This recommendation is acceptable. 
4.      Verification that the Service Contract Act of 1965 does apply to this contract. 
There are no other changes.

<p>Commerce Acquisition Regulation (CAR) clauses:<br />CAR 1352.201-70 Contracting Officer's Authority (APR 2010) <br />CAR 1352.208-70 Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating (APR 2010)<br />CAR 1352.209-73 Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />CAR 1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) <br />CAR 1352.233-70 Agency Protests (APR 2010) {Fill-in paragraph "b": Department of Commerce, NOAA, ERAD, Attn: Christine L. Jeffries, 200 Granby Street, 8th Floor, Norfolk, VA 23510; fill-in paragraph "c": U.S Department of Commerce, Senior Procurement Executive, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW Suite 6422, Washington DC 20230}<br />CAR 1352.237-72 Security Processing Requirements - Low Risk Contracts (APR 2010) <br />CAR 1352.246-70 Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) {Fill-in paragraph "b": on board NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN, 1050 Register Street, North Charleston, SC}<br />CAR 1352.270-70 Period of Performance (APR 2010) {Fill-in paragraph "a": December 21, 2010 - January 21, 2011; paragraph "b" does not apply.} <br />CAR 1352.201-72 Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) {Fill-in paragraph "a": to be provided at the time of award.}</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (OCT 2010) applies to this acquisition and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition, as such consider the following clauses checked:</p>

Prime, sub-contractor or other?<br />b) Would your participation be affected if the awarded period of performance was 5 years rather than 7 years, if so please explain?</p>

<DESC><p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">UPDATE - 24 November 2010 - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</span></p>
<p>This update is to issue Request for Proposal FA2550-09-R-8001. Please see attached Cover Letter and Solicitation with attachments. This solicitation is open to all interested, responsible offerors. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 ($27M).</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference/Site Visit is scheduled to be held at Schriever AFB at 8:30 AM MST on 8 December 2010. A Secret security clearance will be required for any attendees to the site visit. Each company will be restricted to two attendees. Please see Section L of the solicitation for specific details and requirements for those wishing to attend.</p>
<p><span><br /><br />The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award a contract for support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network Support for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) ensuring critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data. Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Network Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program management office or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman can be reached at HQ AFSPC/A7K, 719-554-5250.</p>

<DESC>This amendment to the Sources Sought Notice does the following: - changes the NAICS Code to 541620, and - removes incumbent contract, EPW06032, and contractor, ERG.
The original text was entered in erroneously.  The following text has been revised to reflect these changes.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (EPA/OAM) is conducting market research (for informational purposes only) to identify potential small business sources (including 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns) with the capacity and technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirements described herein.

These services are currently provided by the incumbents, Battelle Memorial Institute and Research Triangle Institute (RTI), under EPA contracts EPW06025 and EPW06026 respectively.    Notwithstanding the Governments option to exercise term extensions, the current contracts are scheduled to expire April/May 2011.  
The proposed acquisition is valued at approximately $25 million, including all options.  The Government anticipates awarding as a five year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) labor-hour contract, in accordance with the procedures under FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.

Interested parties should be concise in their capability statements, and limit responses to no more than 15 pages.  Capability statements should be responsive to all information items requested herein to allow for an accurate business assessment.  Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the Statement of Work (SOW) will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice.  Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements; and no telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses should be sent via email to martiyan.stefan@epa.gov and bushta.dennisjames@epa.gov.  The deadline for submitting capability statements is December 30, 2010, 3:00 PM, ET.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is an unusual and compelling urgency and a delay in award would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government (FAR 6.302-2). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>A non-competitive construction contract was awarded to Zwick Construction on 29 October 2010 for the emergency repair of a main water line break.  The break caused the need to shut off water to the south end of the base thus impeeding fire suppression systems in two main hangars.  The risk to loss of government property and life and the shut down of mission critical aircraft repair services required a contract be awarded under FAR 6.303-2, unusual and compelling urgency.  Zwick Construction is currently constructing a new fire station at the Utah Air National Guard Base and the site where the water main break occurred was inside the fenced off/secured area under construction.  Zwick did not cause the water line break, however, due to the access restrictions of the construction site and urgent need to repair the break, Zwick Construction was sought to assist in the repair.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD awarded a $52,250,000 modification to Raytheon Company, Space and Airborne Systems on a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract (N00019-09-C-0003) for the procurement of 19 AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars to be retrofitted into F/A-18E/F aircraft Lots 26-29. The AN/APG-79 AESA radar, which will replace the APG-73 radar, will provide increased air-to-air detection and track range, increased air-to-ground targeting capabilities, longer launch range for standoff weapons, enhanced capability against advanced threats, and optimized utilization of the aircraft's weapon systems contributing to the F/A-18E/F's survivability.

<ARCHDATE>12242010
<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Carson Contracting Office intent to sole source a contract modification to the existing contractor, Resource Geoscience, Inc., to extend the period of performance for a contract which is a indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract with a 1 year base performance period, plus four one-year option periods. The contract is currently in a three month extension that runs from 1 September 2010 through 30 November 2010. The extension will be for an additional three months to the incumbent contractor Resource Geoscience, Inc., 3740 Wabash Street, Colorado Springs, CO 80906. The extension will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Carson installation. The contract is a firm fixed price contract. This action is intended to be accomplished under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).The extension modification must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. <br/><br/>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that an alternate approach would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments to this notice and detailed capabilities must be emailed to Crystal Price at crystal.l.price@us.army.mil by 22 November 2010 16:00/4:00pm Mountain time. Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.<br/>
