<DESC>R09PS30003 Protective Coating - IDIQ, Hoover Dam, Arizona-NevadaNAICS: 238320 Painting and Wall Covering ContractorsPSC: 1721 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for the application of protective coatings to mitigate corrosion on steel and cast steel surfaces on turbine generators and dam equipment at Hoover Dam.  The work is located at Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona.The areas of steel to be coated vary depending on the work schedule.  In some years, less than one hundred square feet per year is coated, whereas in other years thousands of square feet are coated in a single year.  Due to time constraints, it is often necessary to schedule coating work into specific calendar timeframes to insure that coating does not interfere with other critical-path major maintenance schedules at Hoover Dam.
The principal components of the work include the following: (1) Furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the external 30 foot diameter and 25 foot diameter penstock sections;  (2) Furnishing, erecting and relocation scaffolding system for the external 13 foot diameter penstock laterals.   The 13 foot diameter laterals in the lower penstocks are nearly horizontal.  However, the upper penstock 13 foot diameter laterals slope at an angle of 45 degrees.  Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long; (Laterals are simply the smaller pipe that branches off the 30 foot pipe to feed the hydro generators.); (3) Furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the scroll cases and outlet work piping; (4) Coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the exterior 30 foot diameter and 25 foot diameter penstock, outlet works piping and 13 foot diameter penstocks sections. (5) Surface preparation and furnishing and applying protective coating for isolated spot repair of damaged areas in scroll cases; (6) Control of leakage water when applicable.    (7)  Waterblasting is the required coating removal method to control Visitors Center and Powerhouse ventilation air issues.  The Visitors Center and the Powerhouse both use penstock tunnels as the source of building ventilation air.  Sandblasting or needle-scaling methods will be approved on a case-by-case basis only when the contractor is able to control the atmosphere to breathing air standards.
Methods of accessing the inclined portion of any Penstock should be investigated to facilitate repairs to the failed coating.  The intake cylinder gate flow will be blocked by 12 rectangular shaped bulkheads arranged in a cylindrical pattern around each of the cylinder gate inlets.  Both the upper and the lower cylinder gates will be opened to 100 percent, leaving the rectangular water passage at the downstream face of the bulkhead accessible.  Contractor access to this area will be by scaffold from below or by man-basket from the cylinder gate hoist house.  It is recommended that the Contractor take the necessary action to use the Government's crane to perform this work.  If rope access techniques are utilized, the contractor is responsible for design and fabrication of all access and anchoring systems.  Drawings and work plans must be submitted for review and approval in advance of performing work in the same manner as for scaffolding systems.  The Contractor shall take a coating sampling for lead, heavy metals, etc. and submit the results to the Project Engineer (PE).  The Contractor shall develop a plan to mark each section for repair.  The Contractor shall provide adequate lighting for safety, work, and inspection of the interior coating repair.  The Contractor shall create a containment system during removal of coating and applying of new coating.  
This solicitation is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors with a small business size standard of $14M.  The solicitation, in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP), will be issued on or about June 29, 2009 with offers due thirty (30) days after. The RFP will include evaluation factors for experience, past performance, and price.  The Government intends to award multiple awards under this Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity contract with a performance period of five years.  Fixed price task orders will be competed between the contractors receiving a contract award.  The estimated contract award date is September 14, 2009.  As protective coating work is required, fixed price task orders will be competed between the contractors receiving a contract award.  The estimated magnitude of each task order is between $7,000.00 and $1,300,000.00 with a total contract value estimated between $1,000,000.00 - $5,000,000.00 for the five year period.  In the first year of this Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity contract it is estimated that coating work may include up to 20,000 square feet of penstock coating and up to 4,500 square feet of turbine component coating.  
No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov.

<a href="mailto:Alexander.Daniel@va.gov">Alex Daniel; Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Integrated Service Network 10 (VISN 10) has the need for a contractor to furnish an automated scheduling system and the requisite hardware necessary for its implementation and maintenance within the VA's nursing workforce.  The software will must be able to have the flexibility to be customized based on the needs of the various VA facilities located within the VISN, must be capable of predicting workload demands for clinical care, and have the ability to generate reports to optimize staffing levels.COVERAGE AREA: Proposed systems must be able to reach the VA Medical Centers and all associated facilities located within VISN 10, including but not limited to: The Dayton VA Medical Center, located at 4100 West Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428; The Cincinnati VA Medical Center, located at 3200 Vine St., Cincinnati, OH, 45220; The Chillicothe VA Medical Center, located at 17273 State Route 104, Chillicothe, OH 45601; The Chalmers P. Wylie Veterans Clinic, located at 420 North James Road, Columbus, OH 43219; and The Cleveland VA Medical Center, located at 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, OH 44141.  SET-ASIDE INFORMATION: This procurement is a 100% set-aside for a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Concern. The SDVOSB must be small under the relevant North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) code and MUST be registered and verified in the following websites: http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov, http://ccr.gov, and http://orca.bpn.gov and Vets 100 to be eligible for award.  Offerors MUST ensure registration in these websites are accurate and have not expired prior to the solicitation due date.  This procurement shall be procured and awarded using the commercial item procedures. The applicable NAICS Code is 541511. The contract value is estimated to be approximately $500,000.00.IMPORTANT NOTICE:  This procurement will have a qualification requirement associated with its award.  ALL contractors seeking to place an offer or bid for this requirement MUST BE PRE-QUALIFIED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER in order to be eligible for an award.  To be added to the 'Pre-Qualified List' contractors must demonstrate that they can provide software that can meet the following requirements in a presentation format, either via the internet or a pre-recorded median (CD, Video, Windows Media File, etc.), that is not to exceed two (2) hours in length:1.	Help screen shall be available to all levels of users.  System is user friendly; designed for all personnel's levels of computer skills, novice to moderate working knowledge, and maneuvers straightforwardly and simply amongst modules and platforms. 2.	The software shall be able to identify minimum and maximum staffing levels, based on HPPD (hours per patient day) and census.  In other words, based on the HPPD for that level of unit and the census, the software should be able to tell the supervisor if the unit is over staffed, staffed appropriately or under staffed.  In addition, it should be able to show the manager that the variance is by either hours and FTE (full time equivalent).3.	The software shall be able to manage any combination of shift length; float staff; individual preferences, on-call and rotating shifts.  For example, it should be able to manage both 8 hour and 12 hour tours for one person to make 80 hours/pay period.  4.	The application shall track changes to the schedule by date, time, user who made the change and rationale for the change.  For example, if a person works unscheduled OT (over-time), the software should track who approved the overtime, who entered the overtime, why the overtime was scheduled (i.e.: to cover call-ins), if the OT was mandatory or voluntary, when it was entered, when it was worked and where it was worked.5.	The application shall manage staff qualifications, certifications and licensures.  For example, reports should be available whenever a user has a certification nearing expiration.  In addition, if two staff plan to work for each other, then the software should verify they are qualified to work for each other.  If they are not, the program should reject the exchange.6.	The application shall provide diagnostic tools such as informational messages, warning screens, error messages, and helpful hints, etc.7.	The application will save and close when encountering a fatal error.8.	The application shall provide for multiple, simultaneous users with a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent update of the same contents/field.  To explain, when using Microsoft Access, it does not seem to handle multiple users well and will lock the program up and/or override what was entered when two people try to edit/enter the same field and record.9.	The software shall be compatible with existing VA hardware/software.10.	The application shall provide the utility to import and export data (to Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Proclarity, and Vista - specifically employee information to populate the software and pt. Classifications).  An interface with the Human Resources/Payroll application would be highly desirable.  For an import example, it would be preferable that a continuous/daily download occurs that adds new employees and deactivates employees who are no longer employees in the scheduling software.  For an export example, we have a program called Decision Support System that will need to have reports exported to their system from the scheduling software to track the agency workload.11.	The software shall generate email reminders* and notifications per site set up to both employees and supervisors (i.e. time to approve schedule, sign-off on schedule, Self-Scheduling open for Pay Period 10, Self-Scheduling closed for PP10, etc.) * The user will have the ability to chose where the notification is e-mailed - Vista and/or Microsoft Outlook. 12.	The program shall have a mechanism that locks the schedule to further changes after the supervisor has signed off on the schedule by users below a certain access level.13.	The program shall support the creation of unlimited business rules, templates and parameters.14.	  By law, an RN can not work more than 12 hours in a 24 hour period nor 60 hours in a 7 day period.  The program will have the capability to alert the supervisor before an individual exceeds those parameters.  If it is exceeded, then the program will record the approving official's name, date and a justification for each occurrence.15.	The program shall support partial and total self-scheduling, preference-based scheduling, and cyclical scheduling.  To clarify, the employee needs to be able to request and bid for shifts with direct access to the program. 16.	The program shall provide the ability to print the schedules to be signed for time certification.  To clarify, since the program will not interface with PAID (Vista) the time keeper will still need to keep hard copies of the schedule and enter the schedule into Vista.17.	The program shall provide predefined reports and graphs especially for productivity.  Some of the reports are leave usage, agency use, overtime use, sick leave use and workload efficiency and based on the user selected date range.18.	The program shall provide multiple security levels in terms of who can view, create, update, approve, delete, and create reports based on their position/level of access.  For example, the nurse manager will approve the schedule, the evening/night supervisor can override the schedule to offer OT to an employee and the coordinator can override any entry.  In addition, staff end users will be able to view only their records.19.	The program shall provide the ability to store data and documents throughout their life cycle and be able to archive and retrieve information.  For example, one of the requirements of the VA is to save three years worth of data and possibly five years for patient related data.  The program will need to be able to store all aspects of the data for at least that amount of time before it is archived.  After this time period, the program should be able to archive the data for longer storage and then access it if necessary.20.	 The vendor shall present a contingency plan/backup plan for when the server ceases to function or the connection to the server is severed.  A good example of this is the Bar Code Mediation Administration program.  It downloads all the medications for the patient on a local stand-alone at near real time for access when the server is unavailable.21.	The program shall be able to track and trend census data by unit and facility.  One of the things we noted reviewing our last two year trending of census data is that the overall length of stay and bed days of care are going down, but on two of our units it is going up, which has caused us to adjust our staffing.  Without census data available and trending for each unit, we may not have known a shift in resources was needed.22.	 The program shall have the ability to provide simulation of schedules using what-if scenarios and alternative scheduling to better assist the nurse manager in making the most cost effective decisions.23.	The program shall be network (VISN) wide.  Recently it has been proposed to put together a VA traveling nursing corp.  If this done, the software needs to be able to identify vacant FTE that could be filled by one of these pool persons anywhere within the network.24.	The program shall be able to generate budget reports and graphs based on GS (LPNs and NAs) and Title 38 (RNs) pay scales, grade/step and time.  The budget reports and graphs need to include salary costs (including adjustments for benefits), overtime costs, agency/contract costs, float costs (staff being pulled to/from home unit), sitter costs, and unscheduled sick leave costs.25.	The program shall be able to manage overtime offers based on defined criteria (seniority).  For example, the union requires the VA to equitable offer overtime to each employee who is interested.  All uninterested employees need to be identified and left off the OT call list.  From the interested employee list, when the employee was contacted, the result of the contact (no answer, declined, etc.), who contacted, when contacted and OT being offered needs to be recorded.  This information also needs to be able to be printed by employee name and by OT offered with all the contacts before a replacement was found.26.	The vendor shall be able to provide technical support (on-line, telephone or on-call) 24 hours per day/7 days per week.   All bidders will have until July 10, 2009 to provide their demonstrations, at which, time the listing will be closed.  In order to schedule a time to provide a demonstration or to send in a prerecorded demonstration, offerors are asked to contact: Patty Slonaker, Nurse Program Analyst at the Dayton VA Medical Center at 937-268-6511 x3197 or Patty.Slonaker@va.gov.  Offerors will be notified promptly as to whether or not qualification has been attained or not.  If enough responses have been received the solicitation documents will be posted on or about July 13, 2009.  All responsible and pre-qualified offerors will be invited to submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The FHWA estimates issuance of RFP DTFH61-09-R-00029 for the Michigan IntelliDrive Test Bed Operation and Maintenance within 60 days or later of this notice. A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held in Detroit, Michigan. Time and exact location will be specified in the RFP. Any questions pertaining to this notice shall be emailed to charles.kotch@dot.gov. Answers to all questions received, will be discussed and documented at the Pre-Proposal Conference. No questions will be answered prior to the conference. 

In 2004, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) began its Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative, which was intended to create a core architecture for a new vision of preventative vehicle safety and mobility within the United States. Over the next four years, the USDOT, with its partners in the automobile industry, public universities, and systems integration contractors, conducted research toward the development and deployment of a system that would permit vehicles to communicate safely, securely, and effectively with each other and with infrastructure devices located at the roadside. This communication capability, coupled with data processing capabilities located on vehicles would create transformational opportunities for enabling safety and mobility services to address high priority surface transportation needs.

In early 2009, the USDOT re-branded the VII initiative as IntelliDriveSM.  The re-branding involved more than just changing the name of the initiative. The USDOT also changed some of the basic assumptions related to how vehicles and infrastructure components of the system would communicate. One major change relaxed the constraint that all vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications would use Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) radios and protocols. DSRC would continue to be used for critical safety applications that required both high availability and low latency communications, but other applications were free to use whatever wireless communications technology best fit the users needs.

As part of the thinking that went into the IntelliDrive re-branding, the USDOT assessed its options with regard to the Michigan Development Test Environment (DTE) used during the recent proof of concept testing. Although there are known deficiencies with the current facility, it represents a major test facility investment on the part of the USDOT and has great potential value for the IntelliDrive program as it moves towards a greater focus on system deployment. To realize and maximize that value, the USDOT intends to stabilize the test bed operating environment and open it up to industry for supporting continued research and demonstration needs.

The USDOT has three major goals for the IntelliDrive DTE. These are:
	Make the DTE an effective facility for continued research, testing, and demonstration of IntelliDrive concepts, standards, applications, and potential products usable by both the public and the private sectors (near term) 
	Evolve the DTE into a precursor of the nationwide IntelliDrive deployment by establishing an implementation model of the overall IntelliDrive system that works and demonstrates the effectiveness and value of the IntelliDrive system (mid term) 
	Transfer the DTE to non-Federal control, for possible use either as a certification facility or as the foundation for an actual regional deployment of IntelliDrive capability (long term) 

Additional information on the IntelliDriveSM program and DTE may be found at:
www.intellidrive.org

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Westboro Photonics  in Ottawa, ON, Canada for the purchase of a Instrument Systems, CAS140 CT-153  Spectrometer System.  Westboro Photonics is the exclusive North American representative for Instrument Systems located in Munich, Germany. 

NIST currently has an Instrument Systems CAS140 CT-153 already in use in the lab for field experiments to make SI traceable measurements of the spectral output of a series of standard stars. It is our intent to purchase another Instrument Systems CAS140CT-153 Spectrometer system. Should any other equipment capabilities differ from the instrument already in use, it will compromise the integrity of the analysis of the data and would make it extremely difficult to get accurate results if different equipment were to be mixed and matched. NIST requires two identical instruments to measure the light coming from our source at two different sites.
Otherwise there will be a need to account for different bandpasses, etc. which will make understanding these measurements more difficult.


NIST has extensive custom LabView/Ethernet based data acquisition software that has been developed specifically for the Instruments Systems CAS140 CT-153.  It would be very expensive and time consuming to recreate the whole software data analysis software should another type of equipment be introduced to the existing system.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 90 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 2, 2009.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 12:00 P.M. July 1, 2009 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required analysis. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov.
<p>Justification<br />Rapp Hydema is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the trawl winches on board the NOAA Ship PISCES. The ship has been in commission for less than 30 days. The current winches are too intense for the gulf coast waters. These modifications are needed to fulfill trawling mission requirements. Services by the OEM are required in order to maintain warranty coverage.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a sole-source, Firm Fixed Price contract to Rockwell Collins, Inc., of Cedar Rapids, IA to procure ARC 220(V)3 HF system components from the equipment manufacturer to support modification of CH-46 aircraft. The ARC-220 is an airborne High Frequency (HF) radio system capable of long range communications. The system also employs advanced technology that simplifies and significantly increases the rate of successful connection during less than optimal atmospheric conditions. The ARC-220 is a compact variant from a line of commercial of the shelf (COTS) airborne HF systems produced by Rockwell Collins. These products are the only known HF systems designed and qualified for operation in military aircraft with advanced communication capability. As the ARC 220 original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Rockwell Collins owns exclusive rights to the design and manufacture of the system. This system is urgently required  to support a Global War on Terror (GWOT) initiative that addresses the need for long range communication capability in the CH-46 aircraft. The Rockwell product line of HF systems is the current standard for airborne systems in DOD. The ARC 220 is capable of fully meeting CH-46 requirements as an entirely off the shelf system and offers significantly reduced total life cycle costs by sharing common support structure with a variety of other Navy/Marine platforms. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract will require the contractor to deliver sixty nine (69) each ARC 220(V)3 HF systems commencing 6 months after contract award at a rate of 4 units per month. The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 336413. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c), with Kistler Instrument Corporation for Ten (10) Model # 6053CC75U20 Pressure Transducers.
The EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory is currently testing several new concept engines to be used as part of the propulsion system in a clean fuel efficient hybrid vehicle.  This effort is a part of the EPA?s involvement with the industry/government program Urban Delivery Vehicle (UDV) program to improve exhaust emissions.  The V-8 HCCI engine is a new concept engine which will be installed in a Hydraulic Hybrid Airport Shuttle Bus for a demonstration program in the State of California.  The HCCI engine required in-cylinder pressure sensors to control and operate the engine.  EPA utilizes Kistler cylinder pressure tranducers and amplifiers to measure combustion parameters.  EPA has reviewed the marketplace and determined that there are no other Pressure Transducers with the proper dimensions to fit into the glowplug holes on the V-8 cylinder heads.
The required specifications for a proper Pressure Transducer is as follows:  Pressure range: 0 to 250 bar, Sensitivity: -19 pC/bar, Linearity: less than 0.4%FSO, Temperature range: -50 to 350 degC, Sensor tip diameter: less than 6 mm, Sensor body diameter: less than 8 mm, and Sensor body length: 60 to 85 mm.  
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing Pressure Transducers that meet the above specifications may submit appropriate documentation by July 3, 2009.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to enter into a sole source contract with the University of Michigan to obtain contractor support to aid in the development and assessment of the nuclear analysis capability required for the VHTR evaluation model that will be used for the NGNP.  Specifically, the development work consists of the improvement of the PARCS-AGREE code for the analysis of gas-cooled reactors as well as its integration with other codes such as SCALE/AMPX and MELCOR.  This contract also provides for application support for the steady-state and transient nuclear analysis of VHTR reactors. The University of Michigan is uniquely qualified to provide the services because it has the only team currently qualified having prior knowledge and experience in developing neutronics codes and the analytical skills to analyze experiments and perform neutronic and heat transfer analysis for gas cooled graphite moderated high temperature reactors.  The PARCS development team is composed of the creators of the codes being developed; using this team will allow the NRC to avoid the unnecessary duplication of work, allowing us to complete the necessary research work in a timely and cost effective manner.  The period of performance will be five (5) years. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services and the respondent has no conflict of interest with the projected activities. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Mrs. Adelis M Rodriguez via email at adelis.rodriguez@nrc.gov or by phone at 301-492-3623.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR RICHARD HARDING POFF FEDERAL BUILDING MODERNIZATION IN ROANOKE, VA, SOLICITATION NO.: GS-03P-09-CD-C-0061.  This project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act project.  The Allegheny Service Center in the Mid-Atlantic Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project.  The project delivery method being used is the Construction Manager as-Constructor (herein referred to as CMc).  A Construction Manager as-constructor provides design phase services and construction phase work. GSA intends to award a contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for the Richard Harding Poff Federal Building Modernization in Roanoke, VA, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Design Phase Services are expected to commence upon award of the contract, on or about October 2009.  The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to commence on or about June 2010.

The Richard H. Poff Federal Office and Courthouse Building in Roanoke, VA is a fourteen story modern structure containing 187,649 usable square feet, 255,700 rentable square feet and 316,369 gross square feet with 75 indoor and 94 surface parking spaces situated on 1.3 acres.  This 14 story building was constructed in 1975 with green tinted glass curtain walls on the north and south elevations and brown brick on the east and west elevations.

The buildings tenant finishes have been modernized by the customer agencies but the aging electrical system, windows, HVAC, fire alarm and precast concrete panels require replacement.  The proposed capital project will correct structural and systems deficiencies in the 34-year old building. A list of sustainable objectives for the Poff project has been developed, including: replacement of all windows; upgrades to existing restroom facilities and other building systems including fire alarms; installation of energy efficient HVAC equipment, lighting and lighting controls; roof replacement; and implementation of photo-voltaic solar cell arrays on the South roof and a green roof above space on the first floor.  Additional work may be added at a later date using separate funding for tenant improvements.  

The guaranteed maximum price for this project is $42,000,000 based on FY10 funding for combined services (Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work).  The North American Industry Classification System Code(s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220.  The project will be designed and constructed in Metric Units of Measure.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step and Source Selection procedures per FAR Part 15.
At the time of contract award, the project will be in the early phases of design.  There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The Construction Phase Work is an option.  The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented in the procurement process.  At any time during or after design phase services, the Contracting Officer may request that CMc provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to convert the Contract to a firm-fixed-price contract at the offered price or as otherwise negotiated by the parties to this Contract, so long as such price is less than or equal to the GMP.  If the parties to this Contract negotiate and establish a firm-fixed-price prior to the exercise of the Construction Phase Work Option, then the Contracting Officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the firm-fixed-price option within 60 calendar days of the establishment of that price.

Design Phase Services include, and are not limited to, preliminary evaluation of the Architect of Record design development documents; review and evaluation of the Architect of Record construction document submissions for constructability; review and evaluation of all Architect of Record cost estimates; reconciliation of all cost estimates; participation in all construction document team meetings; value engineering suggestions; identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documents; consultation during design document production; preliminary project schedule development; identification of long-lead items, independent pricing of design document phase and construction document phase submittals; preliminary cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and, establishment of firm-fixed pricing.  The CMc shall possess a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the facility, should the Option for Construction Phase Services be awarded.
Construction Phase Work includes, and are not limited to, construction alterations to the building; project scope management; selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors; administration of the construction contract (how much work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract); administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts; coordination of regular construction meetings; critical path method (CPM) scheduling and schedule control; maintaining construction records including daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring construction costs; progress reporting; conducting and coordinating inspections and testing to ensure proper functioning of the building; participation of Alternative Dispute Resolution partnering consultant; coordination of commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff and tenants; performing closeout procedures; and, all other required services necessary for a complete and sustainable building.
The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA's Construction Manager as-agent; GSA's selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA's building commissioning firm; GSA's security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.
A source selection/greatest value method will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being approximately equal to price.  

This is an advisory two step procurement process.  In 
Stage 1, offerors will present their price proposals and technical qualifications by submitting the following information: price proposal, bonding certification for the ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $42,000,000, general contractors business license, and technical factors consisting of: 1) Experience and Past Performance, 2) Key Personnel Qualifications and Experience, 3) Project Management Plan and 4) Project Specific Knowledge.  It should be noted that the evaluation factors are listed in decreasing order of importance.  In Stage 2, those Offerors included in the competitive range shall be interviewed.  The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

A pre-proposal conference providing instructions for the submission of technical and price proposals will be conducted at the Richard Harding Poff Federal Building in Roanoke, VA on or about 07/16/09.  The exact date and time of this conference will be contained in the solicitation package.  Please email Ms. Kimberly DeSant at kim.desant@gsa.gov to confirm your attendance.  The solicitation will be available on or about 07/07/09.  Interested parties may download their own copy of these documents.  These documents will be in .pdf format and may be accessed on a World Wide Web (WWW) server at http://www.fbo.gov .  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this website for the release of any amendments and to download their own copy of any amendments.  This site provides instructions for downloading the amendment file(s).  

Interested Offerors are required to submit bonding certification of their ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $42,000,000, and are required to be licensed general contractors.  Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and six (6) copies of the required technical and price information. The submission should be in an 8-1/2" x 11" bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), University of Washington, has a requirement for services for operating Real-Time seismic data acquisition system, and to assist in the transition from the Earthworm system to the Cheetah system.
The USGS - Geologic Division, Western Earthquake Hazards Team (WEHZ) requires non-personal services associated with maintenance and operation of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN).  The PNSN is a joint endeavor with the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.  Operation of the PNSN is a complex undertaking requiring the efforts of approximately a dozen persons.  The seismic data and acquisition recording system is called Earthworm, and was originally developed by the USGS for use both within the agency and by cooperating universities that operate regional seismograph networks like the PNSN.  This system consists of many intricate sub-components and interlinking tasks.  Responsibilities for these tasks and components are distributed among the staff that consists of University of Washington employees and USGS employees and contractors.  
The contractor will monitor and maintain certain parts of the Earthworm real-time seismic data acquisition system and the new Cheetah system as it replaces the current system.  The system must be maintained to the standards implemented by the UW.  The contractor will troubleshoot the failure of various Earthworm software modules and restore them to operation; a similar function will apply to the new Cheetah system once installed.  Ultimately, the Earthworm system will be turned off sometime in FY 2010, and all contractor activity will be with the Cheetah system.  The contractor will install digital seismic data recorders in the field.  In the office the contractor will test said instruments before deployment in the field.  The contractor will troubleshoot malfunctioning recorders either in the field or in the office.  If repair is simple, the contractor may make the repairs, otherwise the contractor will prepare appropriate documentation that will accompany the unit back to the factory, describing the symptoms of the malfunction.  
Contractor must have detailed knowledge and experience with operation of the Earthworm real-time seismic data acquisition system and the replacement Cheetah system is a requirement of contractor.  This includes, but is not limited to, a user-level expertise in the Unix, Linux and Windows operating systems.  Contractor shall have substantial experience working with the following digital seismic data loggers and sensor systems:  Refraction Technology 72A series, Terra Technology IDS series, Kinemetrics K2, Guralp 5TD; Sensors: all those sensors on board the previously listed seismograph systems, plus Guralp 3T and 40T broadband sensors and Sercel L4 velocity transducers.  Contractor shall also have experience with the ANSS NetQuake system, including an understanding of the state of health information of most common internet connection configurations and ways to troubleshoot these connections in the field.  Contractor shall also have experience working with Motorola lease-line modems and Lantronix MSS-100 and MSS-484 serial serving devices, and Intuicom Communicator II serial data transceivers (radio modems).  
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) to Lynn Simmons, Seattle, Wa.  The proposed contractor has over four years experience in working within the system and has detailed knowledge and experience with the above mentioned systems.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services/supplies shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ.  This does not represent the Government's only written notice of this procurement. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency.                                                                                            This notice is provided for the reader's convenience to highlight certain requirements found in the RFQ, but is not a part of the RFQ document.  Please refer to the RFQ itself for the full details of any requirement.             
This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 05-33 (effective 15 JUN 09).
All questions regarding this procurement shall be in writing, and addressed to Cheryl Fitch at cfitch@usgs.gov .

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the 'Act'), Public Law 111-5, this notice is provided for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Department of Interior, U.G. Geological Survey (USGS), intends to modify established contract number 08CRCN0053 awarded to Synergetics Incorporated to include provisions and requirements for the Act.  The project described below is within scope of the existing contract, which was originally awarded on a competitive basis.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE INCUMBANT CONTRACTOR.
The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) is a major national initiative led by the US Geological Survey that serves the needs of the earthquake monitoring, engineering, and research communities as well as national, state, and local governments, emergency response organizations, and the general public.  The ANSS will automatically broadcast timely and authoritative products describing the occurrence of earthquakes, earthquake source properties, the distribution of ground shaking, and, where feasible, broadcast early warnings and alerts for the onset of strong ground shaking.  Most importantly, the ANSS will provide earthquake data, derived products, and information to the public, emergency responders, officials, engineers, educators, researchers, and other ANSS partners rapidly and in forms that are useful for their needs.  This requirement is to provide technical support services for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Central Geologic Hazards Team (CGHT).  The types of tasks required include geology, geophysics, seismology, all aspects of computer management and computer database development, computer network support, WEB page design, computer system maintenance and support, technical writing, GIS (geographical information system) analysis and data entry.  The method used for this acquisition was a competitive 8(a) set aside.  The maximum dollar amount shall not exceed $7.5 million over the life of this contract, including all option years.  Task orders will be issued on a firm fixed price basis.  The period of performance is a base year of twelve months and four twelve month option periods.  This contract is currently in the base year with a period of performance of September 19, 2008 through September 18, 2009.  The place of performance is Golden, Colorado.  Full or partial funding for requirements to be completed by resultant task orders may utilize funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements by Synergetics Incorporated, will be incorporated into this contract by Modification Two.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The
Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences
(USUHS) located in Bethesda, MD
on the National Naval Medical Campus, intends to negotiate, on a limited source
basis per FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), a supply contract with Beckman Coulter,
Inc., 250 S Kraemer Blvd</span>.<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Brea, CA (153910070), for a Beckman Coulter <span>Avanti J-30I Centrifuge with Elutriation System equipped with
rotors/adapters and bottles for general use and elutriation and organelle
separation functions.</span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This
acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition
procedures, as stated in FAR 13.106(b)(1) and in accordance with FAR Part 12
(Acquisition of Commercial Items). The North American Industry Classification
System Code is </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">334516</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(b)
Soliciting from a single source.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(1)
For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting
officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that
the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably
available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial
mobilization).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">USUHS
has determined that</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Beckman Coulter </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">is the only reasonably
available source to meet the government&rsquo;s requirement. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Beckman Coulter <span>Avanti J-30I Centrifuge</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> is essential to the Government&rsquo;s requirements and market research has not
produced any other companies&rsquo; products that meet the agency&rsquo;s needs. Beckman
Coulter is the only manufacturer of an elutriation centrifuge. The Avanti J-30I
centrifuge with elutriation system is a high performance and high capacity
floor model centrifuge that is equipped with rotors/adapters and bottles for
general use and elutriation and organelle separation functions. Elutriation is
the only way to fractionate a large number of cells from complex cellular
populations, unless specific stage-specific antibodies are available. These
antibodies are not available in our research, which is the study of homologous
recombination in mice that takes place in leptotene/zygotene stage
spermatocytes. These cells represent only 2-4% of the total germ cell
population, and elutriating centrifugation is the most efficient way to
separate early stage spermatocytes from the rest of the cells.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This
is the only source known to USUHS which can meet this requirement. This is not
a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A
determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action
based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the
government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be
submitted electronically, via email, to </span><a href="mailto:Timothy.Bunting@usuhs.mil"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Timothy.Bunting@usuhs.mil</span></a><span style="font-weight: normal;"> by 2:00 PM on June 25,

The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), PM-135, Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS) currently intends to procure on a sole source basis with B. E. Meyers & Co. Inc, 14540 NE 91 Street, Redmond, WA  in accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2), "Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The purpose of this notice is to make the public aware of the Marine Corps Systems Command intent to solicit a sole source proposal and award. The reason justifying other than full and open competition is that B. E. Meyers & Co. Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of both the GBD-IIIC and the Safety Control Module (SCM) that has been approved for use by the Naval Laser Safety Review Board, Law of War and the Naval Treaty Implementation Program for use by the Marine Corps.

The combination of the GBD-IIIC and the SCM makes up the LA-9/P and the GBD-IIIC cannot be used unless the SCM is mounted on the laser system.  This is not a formal solicitation; furthermore, this synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.

To respond to this notice, contact Mrs. Jamie Arthur, Contract Specialists, 96 CONS/PKB, email jamie.arthur@eglin.af.mil.<br />A requirement exists for an enclosed portable lift platform for the purpose of elevating instrumentation used for data collection. This platform is to be configured based on descriptions and details listed in the requirement section below. The application in which this platform will be used is described as follows:<br />1) The instrumentation will be installed in the enclosed booth that will be heated or cooled depending on ambient temperature or instrument operational requirements.<br />2) The booth is mounted on a scissor type, or similar lifting mechanism, that will raise the booth to an appropriate height needed for data collection.<br />3) Prior to raising the booth, the single axle trailer outriggers will be put in place to provide stability while the platform is out of the retracted or lowered position.<br />4) The heavier equipment will be placed directly on the platform floor viewing out a port hole in each of the three sides of the booth.<br />Other equipment may be positioned to view out windows that are positioned higher on the booth sides. Personnel may be positioned with the equipment, but for the most part the tower will be raised with equipment only. The lift platform will also have an electrical power generator that will operate the lift and provide power for instrumentation. This will allow full operation of the lift and instrumentation combination when positioned at a down range or remote location for data collection purposes.<br />Requirements:<br />1) A weather tight enclosed booth on platform mounted to a single axis trailer.<br />2) The trailer will have appropriate safety lighting and connection to a towing vehicle.<br />3) The ground to platform floor height of 25 to 30 ft (platform extended).<br />4) For stability, the trailer needs to have the appropriate "outriggers" that will manually be put in place prior to lifting the platform.<br />5) There needs to be tie down points at the four corners of the platform. This will allow the platform to be secured to fixed ground tie down points for additional stability.<br />6) The retracted height (ground to highest point) should not go beyond 9'11".<br />7) Ground to platform floor height retracted should be 3 to 4 ft. This will allow heavy equipment to be easily transferred from the platform to a cart.<br />8) In addition to the weight of the booth, the platform will support &gt;500lbs.<br />9) The hitch on the trailer needs to have an adjustable stand with a wheel to allow trailer placement without vehicle.<br />10) Platform size and booth needs to be ~5ft x 8ft. The booth needs to have full (clear) access form one side or end. This will allow a cart to be positioned next to the edge of the platform (platform retracted) and equipment can be easily transferred between the two.<br />11) The door width needs to be 43" minimum. The door height can be typical.<br />12) The door needs to swing wide open (180 degrees) allowing a cart to roll as close to the platform as possible.<br />13) Steps to the platform can be easily removed allowing a cart to be rolled as close as possible to the door opening.<br />14) There needs to be 3 openings (one on each side) that are 12"x12" with an access cover. These openings need to be at the platform level (close to the floor) and centered on each of the 3 sides. The access cover can be removed prior to lifting the platform.<br />15) Six windows are needed, two on each side, on in the front and one in the door. Total window height is optional.<br />16) A single window centered on the front side. Prefer 24" wide with sill at 40" from the floor (same as the side windows). Lower half opens vertically 16". <br />17) The two windows on each of the long side. Prefer 24" wide. The horizontal center or each window should be at 32" and sill height at 40". Lower half opens vertically 16".<br />18) The door window can be fixed. Window sill at 40" from platform. The width as wide as possible for safety reasons.<br />19) AC positioned for non interference with height, equipment, and personnel. Suggest mounting it exterior to the top of the front side and protected from the weather.<br />20) Wired for 110 ac, with multiple outlets 30 amps total. The connection to the generator output can be easily disconnected allowing the use of building power.<br />21) Be able raise and lower the platform from within the booth or on the ground.<br />22) In the case of emergency, be able to lower the platform without applied power.<br />23) An audible alarm when platform is being raised or lowered.<br />24) There needs to be a safety mechanism on the doors to prevent opening when platform is raised and safety chain on the inside of the door.<br />25) A gas generator with sufficient power to run a lift pump, air conditioning, and a 30 amp internal load.<br />26) The booth to be fabricated from aluminum.<br />27) All painted surfaces white (not flat white) with exception of generator and components that don't need painting.<br />28) Removable heavy duty cover or covers (canvas tarp) for the booth and generator. The cover needs to secure to trailer frame.<br />29) If the sides are not sloped out at the top, then there needs to be sufficient overhand or drip edge to prevent water from streaming down the sides and possible seeping into the interior.<br />30) There needs to be mounting points on each of the 4 corners of the booth to secure a 2" diameter round pole that will extend above the booth roof.<br />31) There needs to be sufficient weather proofing to prevent the booth from leaking in a "typical" rain storm.<br />32) Since this is a custom or modified design, questions, or issues must be collaborated with the user to insure the tower meets requirements. Suggest pictures, measurements during fabrication and a site visit prior to painting to insure completeness.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available, at this time. DTRA will not provide comment, clarifications or respond to information requests regarding this Sources Sought Notice, to include, whether a resultant solicitation is likely for release, or will be released. This sources sought notice is published for market research purposes only.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential offerors to enhance, replace, or modify the transport and dispersion (T&D) module Second-order Closure Integrated PUFF (SCIPUFF) consistent with emerging requirements for increased or better CBRN tools capabilities.  This includes new emerging technologies in support of integrated hazard assessment across air and water pathways.   A reverse transport capability will continue to be developed to predict the source characteristics of Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) releases based on available meteorological and CBR sensor information from automated or manual input.

Innovative approaches to new models and or techniques will be consistent with the T&D requirements of the HPAC and JEM programs to include: integration with source term and urban T&D models, CBR source characterization, airborne chemistry, low concentrations for large or small sources, long distance transport, 3D time-dependent meteorology inputs and uncertainty, high-resolution terrain, multi-scale capability for efficient and accurate results, and probabilistic hazard assessment.  

This effort shall include the following tasks:

Continue development of the Formal Adjoint module currently integrated as a prototype in the Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC) 5 version utilizing the JEM Software Developer Kit (SDK) and conforming to JEM architectural and software requirements and constraints.

Coordinate with DTRA staff to support Dstls feasibility study that will identify the benefits of the amalgamation of the adjoint technique with forward modeling - Bayesian inference techniques.  

Develop and present a design for the Formal Adjoint concept and technical plan. A draft design report and presentation shall be delivered before proceeding with the following tasks:

-	Develop and implement the software development environment necessary for building and testing the Formal Adjoint modules.

-	Construct technical documentation describing the Formal Adjoint modules mathematical description of the algorithms that will be used in the formal adjoint, description of the software architecture to be employed, story boards illustrating the data I/O concepts, and requirements for modification of HPAC/SCIPUFF modules.

Implement the Radiation Transport in HPAC (RTH) which entails a detailed and common methodology for treatment of Radionuclide and Fallout in JEM and HPAC.

Refine and develop a multi-phase aerosol, vapor and liquid transport capability in SCIPUFF for dispersion of flashing liquids and solids to vapor and multi-phase mixtures.

Interface the Urban Dispersion Model (UDM) with SCIPUFF within HPAC and JEM.

Expand the capability of SCIPUFF to incorporate additional weather parameters that can be obtained from global and mesoscale numerical weather prediction models.

Attend and actively participate in HPAC and JEM integration, configuration and control board, and developer meetings, which will approximately occur bi-monthly.

Perform module testing in accordance with the test plans developed in the design phase.

Test the integrated module to verify functionality and performance as part of the developmental HPAC and JEM in accordance with the test plan.  

Be on call 24-7 within 4 hours via cell phone as the authoritative experts on SCIPUFF, SWIM (SCIPUFF Weather Input Module), and the HPACtool.

Provide interfaces to internal building models, either or both of the UDM BIM (Building Infiltration Model), or the more sophisticated CONTAM model.

Include the capability to describe heat of reaction within the reaction scheme specification, and enable chemically-driven buoyancy effects in the dispersion calculation.

Enhance the deposition algorithms in SCIPUFF to account more realistically for deposition over water, using the Charnock formulation over open water, and fetch-dependence over smaller areas of water.

Enhancement of SCIPUFF to fully take advantage of multiple processor systems.  Additionally, SCIPUFF for JEM shall be further developed to operate on enhanced 64-bit Windows (Vista) and JEM compatible UNIX operating systems.

An optional task beyond the nominal extent of this effort will be implemented as a developmental contingency, which ensures network based or other external users full access into JEM (and HPAC) capabilities. This task will be to expand this efforts Interface Definition Document (IDD) to include all source term, database utilities, and plot functions much like the current HPAC construct to provide external users the ability to use these capabilities.  Additionally, this effort will develop software that wraps the modules that interact with SCIPUFF and expose full capabilities in a network centric environment.

All tasks must be completed within 36 months (base year plus two option years).

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting the experience, qualifications, knowledge and rough order of magnitude to perform the requirement above within the specified time period. Responses are to be limited to no more than ten pages, single spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font. Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, CAGE code, DUNS Number, applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, business size, and if applicable, small business classification (SDVOSB). The Government encourages responses from small businesses and companies in the small business program.

Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary. This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.

Synopsis:


This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the Government. Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research to identify potential sources of supply to support Navy Fourth Fleet from a platform located in or near Panama City, Panama.

Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is an agency of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA provides supply support and logistics services to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and other federal agencies (customers). The Subsistence Operations, a Directorate of DSCP, is planning to award a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) five-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract. The estimated solicitation issue is Summer / Fall 2009. The intended contract base period is anticipated to be 18 months with two one (1) year option periods and a final option period of 18 months. It is anticipated that there will be a ramp up period although the actual time for ramp up may be subject to change depending on Market Research findings. DSCP Subsistence Supplier Operations is seeking information with the intent to solicit, award and establish a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) service platform in or near Panama City, Panama.  

The SPV Program has been successfully implemented around the world. There are some Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) SPV open solicitations currently on the street. Interested vendors are encouraged to view active solicitations from other regions by visiting FedBizOps.gov.  This will provide prospective offerors some idea of Contract Terms and Conditions, Statement of Work, Contract Administrative Data, Solicitation Provisions, Price Definitions, Rebates and Discounts Language, 832 requirements, Evaluation Criteria/ Past Performance and Reporting Requirements, etc.  The SPV is the primary distribution channel (single distributor) for procurement and delivery of a full range of commercial and Government Furnished Material (GFM) food and beverage items in a geographical region. Customers order directly from the Prime Vendor via the Subsistence Total Ordering and Receipt Electronic System (STORES) with a scheduled delivery date (commonly referred to as Required Delivery Date (RDD). It is anticipated that customers (estimated at nine) will order supplies approximately two times per month. The estimated annual dollar value is $3.8M. Please note that the numbers of customers, frequency of ordering and dollar value are estimates and are subject to change.  The SPV provides all Subsistence products for which it has been authorized to distribute by DSCP Subsistence (via STORES customer ordering catalogs). Designated contracting instruments include, but are not limited to, Manufacturer Pricing Agreements (MPAs) and National Allowance Pricing Agreements (NAPAs) for some Navy Standard Core Menu items. All commercial items are brand name specific or generic products that are identified by a National Stock Number (NSN) or Local Stock Number (LSN).  GFM items are generally ration type items.

DSCP is required to have quantitative metrics to evaluate contractor performance. These include, but are not limited to, Contracting Officer Representative (COR) reports, food audit reports, Not in Stock (NIS) reports, Fill Rate, Rejection reports, CPARS and product recalls. One measure currently utilized under current contracts is fill rate. This measure only allows for inclusion of items defined as usage items by the customer. The fill rate metric is calculated by number of cases delivered divided by number of cases ordered. DSCP is seeking ideas, recommendations, and other metrics based on commercial practices used for evaluating contractor performance. 

Your responses are requested by the close of business on July 20, 2008 and may be sent via mail or email. If email is your preferred source of transmission, we recommend that you look for a confirmation within 48 hours of submission by the point of contact provided below. Any responses received after this date may not be reviewed or considered in our contract formation process.

<RESPDATE>071009
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing one or more parts of a high performance Time Scale and Distribution System to be used as part of NISTs time and frequency measurement programs in the NIST Physics Laboratory. The principal purpose of the system is to provide stable and reliable time and frequency information for NIST measurements services, for coordination of international time and frequency standards, and to provide NIST customers with accurate and precise time and frequency measurements and related services. 

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for one or more parts of the system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for one or more parts of the system.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for Time Scale and Distribution System that can meet the functional requirements outlined below, and which comprises three subsystems:
1.	Frequency Standards and Measurement System.
2.	Precision Time Distribution System.
3.	Precision Time Transfer System.

Potential vendors are encouraged to consider providing information about meeting NIST needs for one, any two, or all three of the subsystems. For example, a vendor may wish to consider providing information for a potential bid only on the Frequency Standards and Measurement System (component #1). Or a vendor may wish to consider providing information for a potential bid on both the Precision Time Distribution System (component #2) and the Precision Time Transfer System (component #3) as a combined procurement. Or a vendor may wish to consider providing information on any combination of the three components, or all three components as a group.

1.	Frequency Standards and Measurement System

This system comprises a time scale of several high performance atomic frequency standards and a high performance measurement system to enable the production of a single weighted average time signal from the ensemble of frequency standards. 

The ensemble of frequency standards is expected to include:
	Approximately ten high performance, active cavity tuned hydrogen masers.
	Approximately eight high performance cesium beam standards. 

The measurement system is expected to include:
	Up to two Auxiliary Output Generators providing time and frequency offset signals compared to the hydrogen masers without significantly degrading maser performance.
	Up to two multi-channel measurement systems, each with at least 32 separate channels.

For all of the equipment, NIST requires the best possible performance, and a record from manufacturers of delivering products that meet or exceed advertised performance specifications for frequency stability and other critical characteristics.


2.	Precision Time Distribution System

This system comprises high performance electronic components required to convert the output from the Frequency Standards and Measurement System (#1 above) into useful signals for distributing NIST time and frequency information. The system is expected to include:
	Approximately 175 high performance 5 MHz distribution amplifiers.
	Approximately 42 high performance Pulse Per Second (PPS) Generators. 
	Approximately six high performance Pulse Distribution Amplifiers.

For all of the equipment, NIST requires the best possible performance, and a record from manufacturers of delivering products that meet or exceed advertised performance specifications for frequency stability, minimal phase noise, and other critical characteristics.

3.	Precision Time Transfer System

This system comprises high performance electronic and fiber optic components required to transfer time and frequency signals from NIST to various external customers and collaborators. The system is expected to include:
	Approximately 12 high performance Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver systems, with varying performance characteristics. The GNSS receiver systems must be able to lock on to GPS L1, GPS L2, GLONASS L1 C/A and GLONASS L2 signals. The receiver systems must provide stable time delays through the entire system. The systems must comprise antennas, cables, and control/analysis computers. The systems must output RINEX observation and navigation formatted data, according to RINEX standard 2.10.
	One new Ku-band Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) system.  This system consists of the antenna and waveguide feed, high power amplifier, low noise amplifier, up converter, down converter, SATRE compatible TWSTFT modem, and a weather proof enclosure to hold the major components and up and down converters in close proximity to the antenna. The system must be designed for very high group delay stability over time and for variations in environmental conditions.
	A complete compensated optical fiber link for radio-frequency transfer comprising a length of optical fiber with optoelectronic modules at each end enabling the modulation of the light by an RF signal and providing the means to compensate for unwanted phenomena including Doppler effects, optical fiber noise and thermal effects. Each physical link is unidirectional and at least 4 physical links will be implemented to ensure a minimum of two independent and fully-bidirectional connections between two buildings on the NIST campus in Boulder, CO, separated by a distance of a few hundred meters at most.
	Up to two 5 MHz Quartz Oscillators with outstanding short-term stability over the temperature range 0 C to 40 C.
	An ultrastable microwave source based on an erbium-fiber optical frequency comb, with two stabilization systems. One system phase-locks the carrier-envelope offset frequency to a suitable RF source, creating a self-referenced optical comb. The other one phase-locks one of the combs optical frequencies to a CW laser stabilized via a thermally-controlled and vibration insensitive, high-finesse optical cavity. The output of the cavity-stabilized, self-referenced optical frequency comb is a microwave signal whose frequency is an integer multiple of the repetition rate of the optical comb and whose short-term frequency stability is the one achieved by any optical frequency part of the comb, effectively creating an optical frequency divider.

It is unlikely that a single manufacturer can provide all the required equipment. Expressions of interest and technical capabilities are sought from potential vendors who can work with a range of original equipment suppliers to provide the required system described above.


Companies that provide systems responsive the NISTs needs for one or more of the subsystems listed above are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541512 with a size standard of $25.0 per annum. 

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide on-going, comprehensive support for Computer Systems Design Services.

 Sources are sought that possess the capability to design, develop, and launch the internet based network for patient-controlled medical image sharing across health case institutes and vendors in this pilot project through a broad collaboration with a large number of professional societies with imagers, physical scientists, engineers and informatics specialists; a large number of industries that provide multiple imaging modalities, engineering firms; and academic institutions. The responsible source will develop and implement an efficient project management process that ensures a high-quality technical performance. The responsible source shall provide all technical documents of the design and source code of the internet based network for image sharing to the Government.

The purpose of this project is to conduct a pilot project to develop an internet based network for image exchange built upon the Integrating Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) and Cross Document Sharing profile (XDS). The Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) collaborated with IHE for EHRs specifications.

 The IHE specifications have been significantly incorporated into HITSP solutions and accepted by Office of National Coordinator for Health Information and the Secretary of HHS. Privacy and security are a great concern in such exchanges. It is recognized that the high quality, cost effective care is best delivered with the presence of a transparent longitudinal record, which may reside at numerous clinical sites and settings. 

The responsible source must demonstrate having experience with sharing image data systems, along with electronic health records (EHRs), through a network for image exchange that has lead to better informed medical decisions and  better analysis of medical outcomes, reductions in unnecessary expenses, and improvements in the quality and safety of patient care, as well as biomedical research. 


SCOPE OF THE WORK

The responsible source will design, develop, and launch the internet based network for patient-controlled medical image sharing in this pilot project. 
The responsible source will develop and implement an efficient project management process that ensures a high-quality technical performance. 
The responsible source shall provide all technical documents of the design and source code of the internet based network for image sharing to the Government. The work shall be done using IHE global patient registry for a patient controlled image sharing.
The responsible source shall develop an internet based network for image exchange built upon Integrating Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) and Cross Document Sharing profile (XDS). 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

This pilot project shall establish several regional image-sharing networks where care sites would be linked through shared access to a patient-centered, Web-based personal health record system.  Each regional network will maintain knowledge of the exams made available by each participating radiology center (hospitals, imaging centers, etc.). This pilot project shall refine the distribution and access model of IHE to ensure that the display and possible import of imaging exams into foreign systems is an intuitive easy process. 

At least five regional networks shall be enlisted to participate in the patient data sharing project. For research image sharing, eight additional institutions shall be identified. These institutions shall have significant experience with image exchange, and shall be currently exchanging research images for several research projects (each with its own image exchange mechanism). 

Responsible source must demonstrate that they have done preliminary work using 1) Patient Identifier Cross-reference (PIX) and Patient Demographics Query (PDQ); 2) IHE Cross Document Sharing profile (XDS); 3) MIRC software; and 4) IHE teaching file and Teaching File and Clinical Trial Export (TCE), to test the technical feasibility to connect patient records and access images that have been acquired in multiple healthcare institutes and with multiple vendor systems.

Responsible source  must demonstrate the ability to include extremely broad expertise and a large number of professional societies of technical professions in project, such as imagers, physical scientists, engineers and informatics specialists and a large number of industries that provide multiple imaging modalities, engineering firms, and academic institutions.  The short time frame allowed for this pilot project mandates the ability to include all professional segments of imaging-related sciences in order to quickly build consensus at each step of the development process.

<DESC><p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division in Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vaisala Inc., of Woburn, MA 01801 for the purchase of a combination radar meteorological digital receiver and signal processor unit.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for a combination radar meteorological digital receiver and signal processor unit manufactured by the Sigmet Division of Vaisala Inc. for an upgrade to the NEXRAD Radar Program. The RVP900 is primarily a hardware upgrade and maintains compatibility with the software necessary to operate the RVP8. This custom government software is heavily integrated with the vendor's software and in some cases is based on it via a licensing agreement developed as part of the Open Radar Data Acquisition project that deployed the original RVP8 based systems. Continued compatibility is a critical factor for avoiding significant costs and additional licensing liabilities that may be involved in any future RVP8 upgrades.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

The lease term requirement is for 15 years.  The space must be available for occupancy January 1, 2010.  The delineated area is in the Central Business District in Phoenix, Arizona.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this decision, the Government will consider, among other things, the costs it would likely incur through relocation, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure costs, non-productive agency downtime, security and other appropriate considerations. 

Space must meet the Federal Governments standards for fire safety; seismic; accessibility; security; and must not be located within a 100-year floodplain.  At minimum, the requirements listed above must be met to be considered as a possible alternative space. 

LEASE TERM:   Fifteen (15) years, five (5) years firm 

OCCUPANCY:  Space must be ready by January 1, 2010.

	Amount and type of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
	Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.
	List of building services provided.

The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Peel Packs and Supplies for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.    Standardization for this product line, Peel Packs and Supplies, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes a full line of sterilization Peel Packs and Supplies; at a minimum this includes sterilization peel packs and packaging supplies in paper/plastic, self-sealing and heat sealing (steam, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and plasma), peel packs and supplies (with or without indicator strips) compatible with appropriate temperatures (i.e. low temperature gas plasma) in a range of sizes from 3.0 inches x 8.0 inches to 19.0 inches x 23 inches plus or minus 0.5 inches and tubing roles/reels with widths ranging from approximately 4 inches to 10 inches<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Peel Packs and Supplies.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is December 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.

Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.

The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the nine (9) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line five (5) different times, for each pouch size in a clinical (patient care) setting during the Central Material Supply (CMS) preparation process and the during the surgical procedure preparation process. The evaluation forms will reflect this process.  The evaluation process will be for three weeks (21 calendar days).  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the Europe CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  <BR>1.	(Product performance) The sterilization peel packs (pouch) seals are consistent, strong and minimizes any shattering, puncturing, or tearing.<BR>a.	The sterilization peel packs (pouch) must remain intact to prevent contamination.<BR>b.	The sterilized pouch will be visually and physically inspected for closure integrity any tears to pouch.<BR>2.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections)  The sterilization peel packs (pouch) when peeled apart, provide a clean separation of the film from the paper, maintaining the sterile integrity of the contents.<BR>a.	The adhesive film on the peel pack (pouch) must not come in contact with package content to maintain sterility of package content.<BR>b.	The evaluator will peel the processed pouch and visually inspect for adhesive film on pouch paper and for film on pouch contents.<BR>3.	(Product performance)  The indicator strip allows easy interpretation of color change to show parameters are met.<BR>a.	The indicator strip must show a color change indicating the sterilization process parameters have been obtained.<BR>b.	After the sterilization process has been completed the evaluator will visually inspect the indicator strip verifying the process is valid by the proper color change.<BR>4.	(Product performance)  The sterilized peel pack containing the sterile surgical item is durable.<BR>a.	The sterilized peel pack must be durable keeping the sterilized surgical item free of contamination for a minimum of a 14 day shelf life.<BR>b.	After the sterilization process has been completed the evaluator will visually inspect and examine the sterilized item for a minimum of 14 days confirming the peel pack remains intact.<BR>a.	It is important for suction tubing connectors to allow the clinician to grasp the connector and secure it to the tubing without causing self harm.<BR>b.	The evaluator will grasp the tubing connector and secure it to the tubing determining the safety of the connector throughout the process.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Only an agreement will be entered into with Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office as a result of this posting.

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Suction Devices-Canisters for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  Standardization for this product line, Suction Devices-Canisters, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. This product line, Suction Devices-Canisters, consists of disposable and reusable hard plastic suction canisters, large volume canisters, suction kits, flexible canister liners, and lids.  The suction canisters must be available in a range of volume sizes (1000 ml to 3000 ml, rigid and thin wall) with liners to fit, disposable large volume canisters available with and without specimen traps (1.2 to 16 liters), and the proper brackets, stands, mounts, and adapters needed to support these devices.  The suction canister kits will include a disposable canister, patient tubing in lengths of 6 feet x 5 millimeters, and vacuum tubing in lengths of 18 inches x 5 millimeters. The lids will include a bacterial filter and automatic shut off valve.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Suction Devices-Canisters.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is January 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>1.	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Suction Devices-Canisters, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $159,409.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Suction Devices-Canisters, are disposable and reusable hard plastic suction canisters, large volume canisters, suction kits, flexible canister liners, and lids.  The suction canisters must be available in a range of volume sizes (1000 ml to 3000 ml, rigid and thin wall) with liners to fit, disposable large volume canisters available with and without specimen traps (1.2 to 16 liters), and the proper brackets, stands, mounts, and adapters needed to support these devices.  The suction canister kits will include a disposable canister, patient tubing in lengths of 6 feet X 5 millimeters, and vacuum tubing in lengths of 18 inches X 5 millimeters. The lids will include a bacterial filter and automatic shut off valve.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final selection recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria. <BR><BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.

The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line one (1) time.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  <BR><BR>Each criterion below will be evaluated one (1)  time by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR><BR>1.	(Joint Commission national patient Safety Goal (NPSG), NPSG.07.02.01  Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction canister system assembles quickly and securely.<BR>a.	An improperly assembled suction system will lead to vacuum failure during emergency or clinical use.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will assemble the canister system by applying canister lid, vacuum tubing, patient tubing, and attach to vacuum system gauge.  The system will be turned on and resistance applied to the patient tubing to ensure that the system is operational.  <BR>2.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction canister port caps remain securely attached after application.  <BR>a.	The suction canister port caps must remain securely attached so that the contents do not leak medical waste when properly disposed.<BR>b.	When canister is full, the evaluator will place the port cap per manufacturer guidelines and manually inspect the security of the cap and seal.<BR>3.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The mouth of the suction canister port is functional.  <BR>a.	The mouth of the suction canister port cap must be wide enough to instill solidifier or to empty the contents of the canister or liner. <BR>b.	The evaluator will remove the port cap and manually add solidifier and/or empty the canister or liner making sure the port opening is functional.<BR>4.	(NPSG.16.01.01 - Improve recognition and response to changes in a patients condition) - The suction tubing fits the canister port securely.<BR>a.	The canister port must receive the suction tubing making a secure connection that does not compromise the system by losing vacuum pressure, complicating the medical procedure.<BR>b.	The evaluator will connect suction tubing to the canister port making sure the system is closed maintaining the desired vacuum pressure.<BR>5.	(NPSG.16.01.01 - Improve recognition and response to change in patient condition) - The suction canister or canister liner is of consistent and even measurements.<BR>a.	The canister graduations must provide consistent measurements to allow accurate determination of fluid output/ removal. <BR>b.	The evaluator will manually instill a known measured quantity of liquid into the canister or canister liner to check accuracy of the graduations.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Suction Devices-Cannulae for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.   Standardization for this product line, Suction Devices-Cannulae, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. This product line, Suction Devices-Cannulae, consists of disposable single packaged sterile suction cannulae and non-sterile suction cannulae (i.e. Yankauer, Frazier, and Poole).  At a minimum the following styles and sizes required are as follows: 1) Tip Suction Frazier control vent/valve, flexible 12fr, 2) Tip Suction Frazier without control vent 10fr, 3) Tip Suction Poole, 4) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent bulbous tip w 6ft tubing, 5) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent bulbous tip w 10ft tubing, 6) Tip Suction Yankauer tapered bulb tip with 12ft tubing, 7) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent bulbous tip, 8) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent standard tip 6ft tubing, 9) Tip Suction Yankauer retract style, control vent bulbous tip 6ft by 7/32in 6ft tubing, 10) Tip Suction Yankauer open tip without control vent.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Suction Devices-Cannulae.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is January 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>1.	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Suction Devices-Cannulae, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $121,643.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Suction Devices-Cannulae 1) Tip Suction Frazier control vent/valve, flexible 12fr, 2) Tip Suction Frazier without control vent 10fr, 3) Tip Suction Poole, 4) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent bulbous tip w 6ft tubing, 5) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent bulbous tip w 10ft tubing, 6) Tip Suction Yankauer tapered bulb tip with 12ft tubing, 7) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent bulbous tip, 8) Tip Suction Yankauer without control vent standard tip 6ft tubing, 9) Tip Suction Yankauer retract style, control vent bulbous tip 6ft by 7/32in 6ft tubing, 10) Tip Suction Yankauer open tip without control vent.<BR><BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.	Each technical/company criteria below provides additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>d.	The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.  <BR>e.	Vendors must provide a complete product line of Suction Devices-Cannulae products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a 12-month period.  <BR><BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the Europe CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below.  (Note the ten (10) criteria below must be answered with the vendors initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement). <BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  <BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete product line of Suction Devices-Cannulae products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve month period.

The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line one (1) time.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT evaluated products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  <BR>1.	((NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction cannula has a non-slip grip in dry, wet, and serosanguinous (bloody) environments.<BR>a.	The clinical team member requires the suction cannula to have a non-slip grip facilitating the suctioning process of the patient in the operating room or intensive care unit.<BR>b.	The evaluator will don protective gloves and work with the cannula in a wet and dry environment to ensure the cannula is operational.<BR>2.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction cannula has smooth suction holes that are appropriately placed for type of instrument.  <BR>a.	The suction cannula requires smooth suction holes to provide the maximum suction performance when required by the clinician.<BR>b.	The evaluator will examine the cannula to ensure the cannula suction hole is smooth providing the maximum required suction performance.<BR>3.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction cannula allows for the suction tubing to fit securely.  <BR>a.	The suction cannula and tubing integrity must not be compromised to cause the system to lose vacuum, complicating the medical procedure. <BR>b.	The evaluator will manually test the cannula and tubing connection by applying the tubing to the cannula, inserting the cannula into a fluid filled container observing continuous uninterrupted suction.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Suction Devices-Tubing and Connectors for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  Standardization for this product line, Suction Devices-Tubing and Connectors, represents a new or first time standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region / represents a previously standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. The Europe Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 2004 and it expires November 30, 2009.  GGOJO Industries was the vendor for the previous RIA award. This product line includes a full line of  Suction Devices-Tubing and Connectors consisting of single packaged sterile tubing, non-sterile bulk tubing, and tubing connectors.  At a minimum, the product must include the following items.<BR>1.	Suction Tubing: <BR>a.	Tubing suction nonconductive 5mm ID 100ftL non-sterile integral connector<BR>b.	Tubing pressure 24in male/female connector <BR>c.	Tubing pressure 60in male/female connector<BR>d.	Tubing suction nonconductive bubble 5mm ID 100ftL non-sterile<BR>e.	Tubing suction nonconductive funnel/tapered 5mm ID 6ftL non-sterile<BR>f.	Tubing suction nonconductive 5mm ID 12ftL sterile female connector<BR>g.	Tubing suction nonconductive 5mm ID 6ftL sterile female connector<BR>2.	Tubing Connectors:<BR>a.	Connector for suction tubing 6in1 y-type sterile<BR>b.	Connector for suction tubing 5in1 3/16-7/16in non-sterile<BR>c.	Connector for suction tubing Y-TYPE 7/32-7/15in non-sterile<BR>d.	Connector for suction tubing 5in1 sterile<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Suction Devices-Tubing and Connectors.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is January 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.

All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.

Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the eight (8) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line one (1) time.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) calendar days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT evaluated products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The two product lines will be evaluated by using a combination, not all, of the approved clinical/performance criteria as above.  The evaluation forms will use the following above clinical/performance criteria.<BR>1.	The suction tubing evaluation form will include criteria 1, 2, and 3.<BR>2.	The suction connector evaluation form will include criteria 4 and 5.<BR>Each criterion below will be evaluated one (1)  time by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (no patient involvement) setting.<BR><BR>1.	(Joint Commission national patient Safety Goal (NPSG), NPSG.07.02.01  Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction tubing has low coil memory and drapes well.<BR>a.	Suction tubing with coil memory adds additional time to the clinical procedure by making the clinician take more time to secure the tubing to the operational field. <BR>b.	The evaluator will remove the tubing from its sterile packaging or non-sterile roll and examine for excessive tubing memory.  <BR>2.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The rigid tubing withstands a high vacuum pressure without collapsing.  <BR>a.	The suction tubing integrity must not be compromised to cause the system to lose vacuum complicating the medical procedure.<BR>b.	The evaluator will manually test the tubing by applying a range of suction pressures and observing tubing response.<BR>3.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction tubing fits securely to the Cannulae and the suction canister.  <BR>a.	The suction tubing integrity must not be compromised to cause the system to lose vacuum complicating medical procedure. <BR>b.	The evaluator will manually connect the tubing to the cannulae at the patients end and the suction canister checking for a proper fit and maintaining suction pressures.<BR>4.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction tubing connectors fit securely to the suction tubing.<BR>a.	The suction tubing connector integrity must not be compromised to cause the system to lose vacuum complicating the medical procedure. <BR>b.	The evaluator will manually connect the tubing connectors to the tubing checking for a proper fit and maintaining suction pressures.<BR>5.	(NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The suction tubing connectors are functional allowing a secure hold of the connector.<BR>a.	It is important for suction tubing connectors to allow the clinician to grasp the connector and secure it to the tubing without causing self harm.<BR>b.	The evaluator will grasp the tubing connector and secure it to the tubing determining the safety of the connector throughout the process.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for CSR Sterilization Wraps for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  Standardization for this product line, CSR Sterilization Wraps, represents a previously standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. The Europe Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 2004 and it expires December 31, 2009.  The current vendor chosen for this product line is Kimberly-Clark Healthcare.  This product line includes a full line of CSR Sterilization Wraps; at a minimum this includes Disposable CSR Sterilization Wraps that are non-absorbent, with minimal/low lint, provide for a variety of sterilization methods (steam and low temperature sterilization), in a variety of sizes to include but not limited to  Regular strength Wraps, 1 and 2 ply (sizes 24 inches x 24 inches and 36 inches x 36 inches); Mid-weight strength Wraps, 2 ply (sizes 18 inches x 18 inches and 24 inches x 24 inches);  Heavy-duty strength Wraps, 2 ply (sizes 24 inches x 24 inches, 36 inches x 36 inches, 48 inches x 48 inches, and 54 inches x 54 inches); and Ultra Wraps, 2 ply (sizes 36 inches x 36 inches, 48 inches x 48 inches, and 54 inches x 54 inches). <BR><BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for CSR Sterilization Wraps.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is December 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>1.	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of CSR Sterilization Wraps, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $207,926.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Disposable CSR Wraps that are non-absorbent, with minimal/low lint, provide for a variety of sterilization methods (steam and low temperature sterilization), in a variety of sizes to include but not limited to  Regular strength Wraps, 1 and 2 ply (sizes 24 inches x 24 inches and 36 inches x 36 inches); Mid-weight strength Wraps, 2 ply (sizes 18 inches x 18 inches and 24 inches x 24 inches);  Heavy-duty strength Wraps, 2 ply (sizes 24 inches x 24 inches, 36 inches x 36 inches, 48 inches x 48 inches, and 54 inches x 54 inches); and Ultra Wraps, 2 ply (sizes 36 inches x 36 inches, 48 inches x 48 inches, and 54 inches x 54 inches).<BR><BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.	Each technical/company criteria below provides additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.

The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the nine (9) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line five (5) different times in a clinical (patient care) setting.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within seven (7) days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.   <BR>1.	(Product performance) - When applying to appropriate items, the sterilization wrap conforms smoothly without stretching or tearing.  <BR>a.	The CSR Wrap must be strong, flexible and remain intact throughout the sterilization process for sterility of the package to be maintained.<BR>b.	Each wrap will be applied according to manufacturers guidelines, and visually inspected for conformity, stretching and for tears.<BR>2.	(Joint Commission NPSG07.01.01 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) Sterilization wraps resist saturation and any penetration of liquids.<BR>a.	The CSR barrier must effectively resist saturation and /or any liquid penetration to maintain package sterility. <BR>b.	The CSR Wrap will be inspected after a sterilization process cycle for visual signs of moisture and/or wetness.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Soaps and lotions for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.  Standardization for this product line, Soaps and Lotions, represents a previously standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. The Europe Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 2004 and it expires November 30, 2009.  The current vendor chosen for this product line is GOJO Industries.   This product line includes a full line of Soaps and Lotions but is not limited to liquid soaps (8 and 32 ounce containers), combination soaps/lotions (8 and 32 ounce containers), lotions compatible with waterless hand sanitizers (2, 4 and 12 ounce containers), and shampoos (4 ounce containers).<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Soaps and lotions.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is November 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>1.	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Soaps and Lotions, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $120,337.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Soaps and Lotions to liquid soaps (8 and 32 ounce containers), combination soaps/lotions (8 and 32 ounce containers), lotions compatible with waterless hand sanitizers (2, 4 and 12 ounce containers), and shampoos (4 ounce containers)<BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.	Each technical/company criteria below provides additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>d.	The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.  <BR>e.	Vendors must provide a complete product line of Soaps and Lotions products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a 12-month period.  <BR><BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the Europe CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below.  (Note the thirteen (13) criteria below must be answered with the vendors initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement). <BR>1.

Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each of the six (6) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line five (5) different times, for three (3) 8 to 12 hour days (this involves numerous hand washing episodes) then breaking for two days before a different competitors product is evaluated in a clinical (patient care) setting.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within 30 days.<BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.   <BR>1.	(Staff Compliance/Efficiency of Care/Staff-Patient Safety/ Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal (JC NPSG) 07.01.01-Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) - The liquid soap/lotion product dispenses pre-measured amount effortlessly without repeated attempts and/or without clogging and/or dripping from the dispensing nozzle.  <BR>a.	Effortless dispensing is a key component in staff compliance and time efficiency during patient care; no-drip dispensing prevents a safety risk from wet floors/counters. <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe dispensers for barriers to ease of dispensing such as repeated attempts, clogging, and/or dripping leading to an insufficient amount for effective cleansing.<BR>2.	(Staff Compliance/Infection Control/Staff Comfort) - The liquid soap/lotion product leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and non-irritated (not dry, cracked, chafed or irritated).       <BR>a.	Dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin is a deterrent to staff compliance; dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin is vulnerable to infection.            <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe for dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin.           <BR>3.	(Staff Compliance/Infection Control) - The liquid soap/lotion product does not leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption.   <BR>a.	Residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption may attract environmental microbes/pathogens placing staff/patients at risk for infection.          <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe for greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue build-up on skin.          <BR>4.	(Staff Compliance/Staff-Patient Comfort) - The liquid soap/lotion product scent/odor is not offensive during dispensing and/or after absorption.     <BR>a.	Offensive scent/odor may cause allergic/sensitivity response in staff and/or patients.<BR>b.	Evaluator will observe for offensive scent/odor and/or lingering offensive scent/odor.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Standardization Europe Region announces the standardization initiative for Hand Sanitizers-Waterless for its 44 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTF) in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.    Standardization for this product line, Hand Sanitizers-Waterless, represents a previously standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region.  The Europe Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 2004 and it expires November 30, 2009.   The current vendor chosen for this product line is GOJO Industries.  This product line includes but is not limited to Hand Sanitizers-Waterless in both liquid/gel and foam formulas containing a moisturizer with an alcohol content of between 60%-95% [per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, October 2002 in 2, 4-7, and 32 ounce containers.  <BR>1.	The Hand Sanitizers-Waterless samples: 6 of each size as stated below per each of the six (6) MTFs as follows.  The below formulas, liquid/gel and foam, must contain a moisturizer.<BR>a.	Multi-Use (minimum 9 oz. each) Hand Sanitizer - Liquid/Gel Formula<BR>b.	Multi-Use (minimum 9 oz. each) Hand Sanitizer - Foam Formula <BR>2.	For each category of product sample specified above the vendor must provide the appropriate product dispensers.  Product dispensers suitable for desk/counter-top use are preferred, but product dispensers for temporary wall mounting will be accepted.<BR><BR>This RIA initiative will be a Two Phase RIA Process:   Vendor(s) who meet the technical/company criteria in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate in Phase II where pricing will be required for submittal along with no charge product literature and samples.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of health care across the Europe Region and to achieve a best value determination for Hand Sanitizers-Waterless.  The outcome of this review represents the clinically preferred product and/or source at the best possible price.  The devices selected will be used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force to deliver patient care at operational CENTCOM facilities in the region and at MTFs in EUCOM.  It is expected that 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs of the Europe Region will be purchased through the resulting RIA.  The standardized products will be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Europe Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella,    U. S. Army 30th Medical Command, and U. S. Army Central Command.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the Prime Vendor Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  The anticipated selection date is November 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.   The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Europe Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact (POC) is Mr. Robert Halliday, phone: 011-49-6221-172108, and e-mail robert.halliday@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>1.	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Hand Sanitizers-Waterless, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within the Europe Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $247,687.    This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Hand Sanitizers-Waterless in both liquid/gel and foam formulas containing a moisturizer with an alcohol content of between 60%-95% [per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, October 2002 in 2, 4-7, and 32 ounce containers.  <BR>a.	The Hand Sanitizers-Waterless samples: 6 of each size as stated below per each of the six (6) MTFs as follows.  The below formulas, liquid/gel and foam, must contain a moisturizer.<BR>b.	Multi-Use (minimum 9 oz. each) Hand Sanitizer - Liquid/Gel Formula<BR>c.	Multi-Use (minimum 9 oz. each) Hand Sanitizer - Foam Formula <BR>d.	For each category of product sample specified above the vendor must provide the appropriate product dispensers.  Product dispensers suitable for desk/counter-top use are preferred, but product dispensers for temporary wall mounting will be accepted.<BR>2.	Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items (sizes are approximate) listed above. Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>3.	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  Vendors who do not meet this criterion will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative must E-mail your response to robert.halliday@us.army.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address), (3) the company DAPA number, and (4) the company detailed responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by close of business (COB) on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ); will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Europe Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTFs within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their detailed responses and required documentation to robert.halliday@us.army.mil  by the required response date. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Europe TPRB and the Europe Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>1.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.	Each technical/company criteria below provides additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>d.	The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.  <BR>e.	Vendors must provide a complete product line of Hand Sanitizers-Waterless products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a 12-month period.  <BR><BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the Europe CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below.  (Note the eleven (11) criteria below must be answered with the vendors initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement). <BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  <BR>1.

Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process and Pricing Analysis  <BR><BR>Clinical Evaluation Process  <BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the Europe CPT determined/approved the product samples sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical (patient care) setting.  Requested samples will only include high-volume products.  Based on this determination, the following procedures will apply.  <BR>1.	To avoid shipping delays caused by Europes Customs Offices, the Europe Region TRBO office requires  sample sets from each qualifying vendor to be sent directly to the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail address robert.halliday@us.army.mil or USPS to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 Tri-Service Standardization<BR>Mr. Robert Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>2.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship product samples / literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of samples by COB on the 14th calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send Europe Region TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date via e-mail digitally signed.  Verification of shipment is defined as sending the Europe Region TRBO a copy of the USPS PS form 2976-A customs form.  The PS form 2976-A will have a stamped date the package was accepted by USPS.  Vendors whose packages have a stamped date after the established notification to ship deadline date will be disqualified from this standardization process.<BR>3.	Vendor will provide, the only following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation (unused samples will not be returned).<BR>a.	The Hand Sanitizers-Waterless samples: 6 of each size as stated below per each of the six (6) MTFs as follows.  The below formulas, liquid/gel and foam, must contain a moisturizer.<BR>e.	Multi-Use (minimum 9 oz. each) Hand Sanitizer - Liquid/Gel Formula<BR>f.	Multi-Use (minimum 9 oz. each) Hand Sanitizer - Foam Formula <BR>b.	For each category of product sample specified above the vendor must provide the appropriate product dispensers.  Product dispensers suitable for desk/counter-top use are preferred, but product dispensers for temporary wall mounting will be accepted.<BR>c.	Samples are to be shipped to the Europe Region TRBO.  The Europe Region TRBO requests sample orders be separated by MTF.  The Europe Region TRBO will have the responsibility of forwarding the samples to the participating MTFs. Vendors are not allowed to send any other product samples sets or materials other than what the Europe CPT has requested.   Failure to abide by this request will disqualify the vendor from further consideration in this standardization process.<BR>4.	The specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative.<BR>a.	Vendors will only provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>b.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.   <BR>c.	Vendors will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitors products.<BR>d.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process. <BR>e.	Each  of the six(6) MTFs will evaluate a vendors product line five (5) different times, for three (3) 8 to 12 hour days (this involves numerous hand washing episodes) then breaking for two days before a different competitors product is evaluated in a clinical (patient care) setting.  The MTFs will complete this evaluation process within 30 days.  <BR>5.	The Europe CPT will evaluate each vendors sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>6.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally:<BR>7.	The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1) not acceptable, two (2) minimally acceptable, three (3) acceptable, four (4) more acceptable, and five (5) highly acceptable.  The Europe CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The Europe CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores.  In addition, the Europe CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval). <BR>8.	To determine acceptability, a Europe CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criterion stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>9.	Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Europe Region TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the Europe CPT for final review. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: <BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT evaluated products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.  The product line will be evaluated by using a combination, not all, of the approved clinical/performance criteria as above.  The evaluation forms will use the following above clinical/performance criteria.<BR>1.	(Staff Compliance/Efficiency of Care/Staff-Patient Safety/JC NPSG07.01.01-Reduce the risk of health care associated infections)  The hand sanitizer product dispenses pre-measured amount effortlessly without repeated attempts and/or without clogging and/or dripping from the dispensing nozzle.  <BR>a.	Effortless dispensing is a key component in staff compliance and time efficiency during patient care; no-drip dispensing prevents a safety risk from wet floors/counters. <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe dispensers for barriers to ease of dispensing such as repeated attempts, clogging, and/or dripping leading to an insufficient amount for effective cleansing.<BR>2.	(Staff Compliance/Staff-Patient Safety)  The hand sanitizer product absorbs easily and quickly.        <BR>a.	Easy and quick absorption is a key component in staff compliance and time efficiency during patient care; quick absorption prevents slippery skin surfaces which place staff/patients at risk for mishaps/injury. <BR>b.	Evaluator will observe for consistent absorption and drying time less than 30 seconds.  <BR>3.	(Staff Compliance/Infection Control/Staff Comfort)  The hand sanitizer product leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and non-irritated (not dry, cracked, chafed or irritated).       <BR>c.	Dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin is a deterrent to staff compliance; dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin is vulnerable to infection.<BR>d.	Evaluator will observe for dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin.           <BR>4.	 (Staff Compliance/Infection Control)  The hand sanitizer product does not leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption.   <BR>e.	Residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption may attract environmental microbes/pathogens placing staff/patients at risk for infection.  <BR>f.	Evaluator will observe for greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue build-up on skin.         <BR>5.	(Staff Compliance/Staff-Patient Comfort)  The hand sanitizer product scent/odor is not offensive during dispensing and/or after absorption.     <BR>g.	Offensive scent/odor may cause allergic/sensitivity response in staff and/or patients. <BR>h.	Evaluator will observe for offensive scent/odor and/or lingering offensive scent/odor.    <BR>6.	(Staff Compliance/Efficiency of Care)  The hand sanitizer product does not interfere with donning or removal of medical gloves (exam or surgical gloves).      <BR>a.	Interference with donning/removal of medical gloves is a deterrent to the use of Hand Sanitizers and/or the use of medical gloves as personal protective equipment during patient care.      <BR>b.	After dispensing product and allowing absorb or dry on the skin, evaluator will don and remove medical gloves (exam or surgical gloves) and observe for ease of donning/removal of gloves.<BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process<BR>1.	Upon completion of Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide their best product and price discount quotes concurrent with product samples being requested.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Europe Region.  Pricing must be received at the Europe Region TRBO by COB, fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Europe MTFs).<BR>a.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods. <BR>b.	Vendors will forward pricing to the Europe Regional TRBO, and the Europe Regional TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the Europe TPRB.  The Europe TPRB will select the vendor giving the best overall value both clinically and financially for the Europe Region.<BR>2.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in order of importance:   	<BR>a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Europe Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.<BR>b.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Europe Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>c.	Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting metric.  <BR>d.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR>3.	The Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Europe Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Europe Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Request For InformationSuspension and Retention Systems for Combat HelmetsRFI M67854-09-I-3050

Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PM ICE) is seeking information on production ready combat helmet suspension and retention system products.  This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to collect information from industry regarding availability of improved helmet suspension and retention systems that are or can be made compatible with both the Marine Corps' current Lightweight Helmet (LWH) and planned Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH).  The ECH, currently being sought through solicitation M62854-09-R-3025, has the same inner geometry as the Army's current Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH).  However, the ECH may be thicker than the current ACH and may therefore also require alternative mounting hardware for new suspension and retention systems.  Suggested test procedures to support the evaluation of the proposed suspension systems against blast, ballistic, and blunt trauma threats and the proposed retention systems' ability to maintain helmet stability are also desired.   
Background: Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PM ICE) is seeking production ready suspension and retention system products to improve blast, ballistic, and blunt impact protection as well as to achieve increased helmet stability and overall user comfort.  At a minimum, PM ICE seeks the following desired characteristics from an improved suspension and/or retention system:(1)	Provide blunt force impact protection for the LWH or ECH by limiting peak test headform acceleration to a maximum of 150G when tested at an impact velocity of 17.3 feet per second (Objective)  or 14.1 feet per second (Threshold) under basic cold, ambient, and basic hot conditions as described in MIL-STD 810F.(2)	Be compatible with or easily retrofitted into all sizes of either the LWH or ECH without the need to drill additional holes in the helmet shell. (3)	Provide increased human comfort compared to the current fielded systems and allow for user customization/adjustment without altering the level of protection.  MCSC is currently coordinating a potential Fiscal Year (FY 10) effort with research laboratories to conduct an open industry, comparative analysis of any identified suspension and retention systems.  The proposed effort would seek to evaluate any identified suspension and retention systems against existing, refined, and potentially new test protocols to determine their performance.  The market research collected from responses to this RFI may be used in planning for the proposed FY10 comparative analysis.  Product samples submitted in response to this RFI will not be subject to the comparative analysis, however, any information submitted regarding test methodologies or procedures may be considered for inclusion in the test plan for the competitive analysis.  Responses to this RFI may be used to make initial contact with those interested parties that have identified candidate systems for evaluation.  In their response to this RFI, interested parties are asked to provide the following information regarding their candidate suspension/retention systems: model number, system specifications, available test data, per unit cost, weight, production readiness or current production capacity, picture of candidate system, a point of contact, and lead time to provide up to 10 units for evaluation.  Respondents may also provide product samples with their response.  Any provided information may be shared with government partner research laboratories that may participate in the proposed effort.   Any information marked "Proprietary" will not be shared outside of the government.  
Interested parties with multiple candidate systems are encouraged to submit the above requested information on all available items or products. Vendors who believe they have a product capable of meeting these requirements are requested to provide product literature (a short information paper), brochures, price lists, warranty coverage, and any other relevant information.  Company size, capability and past performance information should be included. Quantity and funding availability are unknown at this time.  Interested parties should reference Berry Amendment Compliance.  Interested parties should send all responses, samples, and capability statements to: Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050, ATTN: Mr. Andrew Fonda Code CESS Contracts.  Responses and product samples are due no later than 17 August, 2009 3:00pm EST.   Please direct all questions regarding this RFI to andrew.fonda@usmc.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  Submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items or services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI.  No solicitation document exists.

<p><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Opportunity:</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and further develop vaccines using nanolipoprotein constructs. <br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background: </strong></p>
<p>Vaccine development is an expensive, multi-year effort from conception to patient administration. The problems of time and expense with vaccine development are often associated with "whole microbe"-based vaccine approach and classical methods of production, e.g. fertilized chicken eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Classic passivation of an infectious microbial agent by chemical treatment or biological re-engineering to modify known/established virulent genes, requires substantial resource investments and regulatory approval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, despite these hurdles, vaccines are one of the most effective ways to prevent infectious disease proliferation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the advent of modern molecular biology methods, sub-unit vaccines have become an interesting alternative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This approach involves cloning and expression of immunogenic microbial proteins only, not growing and attenuating live microbes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While more convenient, subunit vaccines have their challenges, e.g.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>antigen/immunogen epitope discovery (isolating the agent responsible for eliciting a protective immune response), epitope purification and epitope conjugation remain significant challenges. This approach, however, holds the potential for enabling rapid development of new protective vaccines consistent with responding to emerging threats. The possibility of bioterrorism as well as emerging infectious pathogens (West Nile Virus, Yellow Fever, Coronaviruses, etc.) require novel, rapid and inexpensive approaches to accelerate vaccine development to protect against these threats. <br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Description: </strong></p>
<p>LLNL is interested in developing a universal platform for the delivery and presentation of any protein antigen, including toxin, viral and bacterial proteins, with apparent concomitant adjuvant activity to enhance the host immune response.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>LLNL and University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) have used nickel-chelating nanolipoprotein particles (Ni-NLPs) as a universal vaccine platform for five main reasons:</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; tab-stops: 45.0pt">(1) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the approach is scalable enabling chemical manufacturing approaches, avoiding timely and expensive bio-processing, i.e., growing in fertilized chicken eggs;</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt">(2) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>nickel-chelating ability of the Ni-NLPs allows conjugation of any (His)-tagged protein or other immunogenic molecule, opening the door to thousands of potential antigens;</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt">(3) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ni-NLPs can act as articulate delivery systems, similar in size to certain pathogens while also enabling patterned,&nbsp;oriented and concentrated/clustered antigen presentation;</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt; tab-stops: .75in">(4) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>formation of Ni-NLPs is amenable to the incorporation of secondary additives to enhance immune response (e.g. non-human scaffold proteins, chemokines, cytokines, pattern-recognition receptor agonists and immune stimulatory molecules, synthetic or natural, known or unknown at this time); and</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -22.5pt">(5) <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>additional adjuvants, can be incorporated into Ni-NLPs for further enhanced immunogenic ability.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on Ni-NLPs see a recent publication in Bioconjugate Chemistry, 2009, Vol. <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">20, Issue 3, pp.460-465.</span> <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bc8003155">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bc8003155</a></p>
<p><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Potential Applications: </strong></p>
<p>This invention can be developed for rapid sub-unit vaccine development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By conjugating any of the thousands of His-tagged biomolecules, e.g. proteins, peptides, toxins, carbohydrates and the like to Ni-NLP constructs, an effective protective vaccine construct can be realized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Protection of armed forces and the general public can be realized potentially with direct, systematic and compliant product development.<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Development Status: </strong></p>
<p>Initial tests have been performed in mice inoculated with West Nile Virus (WNV) conjugated with Ni-NLPs and then challenged with WNV. The survival rate is greater than eighty percent relative to non-inoculated control animals. Other systems LLNL is looking to test include tularemia, H5/NI, H1/N1, etc. LLNL has filed a U.S. Patent application and the technology is being further developed.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE CONTACT  Ivy M. Scott AT ivy.m.scottfouche@us.army.mil<BR> <BR>DESC   REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Requests For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations for a performance-based acquisition strategy that focuses on supply-chain management in support of the BETSS-C spare parts.  A future solicitation/contract would provide performance-based driven support and management services for CECOM managed BETSS-C spare parts located worldwide.  This is not a Requests For Proposals (RFP), or an Invitations For Bids (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from interested parties, to be answered during Industry Day, must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.  <BR>BACKGROUND: <BR>RDISS Description: RDISS is a fixed surveillance system that can be quickly installed with minimal training and provide the warfighter situational awareness in those activities immediately outside protective barriers.  RDISS consist of two Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras with IR illumination capability and eight fixed cameras monitored from a dual-processor workstation.  Fixed cameras have IR sensitivity for high-quality images at night and video capability of 45 frames per second at 640 X 480 resolution.  The PTZ camera provides 18x optical zoom, continuous auto zoom, 60m active IR illuminator and 360-degree continuous rotation.  The workstation supports 24-hour continuous recording with video files that can be saved and stored for later analysis.  A single Soldier can monitor 10 or more cameras at one location.<BR>FPS Description: The system includes PTZ cameras, the EOSS 250TC integrated thermal imaging system, an AN/PPS-5C Man-Portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR), and Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS) Unattended Ground Sensors UGS to detect enemy activity. All of these sensors are connected to the Tactical Automated Security System for command and control.  However, spare parts for MSTAR and BAIS will not be covered under this RFI. <BR> Cerberus Description: Cerberus consists of a trailer-mounted tower with multiple detection and assessment systems, all self-contained on a single mobile platform. Cerberus uses three detection sensorsground surveillance radar (GSR), video motion detection on staring cameras, and optional UGS. Cerberus has two system configurations (standard- and long-range) to provide the Warfighter the flexibility to adjust to a variety of terrains, threats, and missions. <BR>Multiple towers can be netted for control and annunciation to a Common Operating Picture (COP). Networking multiple towers allows an operator to observe the entire perimeter through an easily understood display.  The alarm and assessment data are presented automatically on the display through data overlays and pop-up windows. <BR>Regardless of system configuration, all variants are integrated onto a MIL-STD Generator Trailer that is HMMWV towable and sling-load-certified. Each self-contained system uses MIL-STD HMMWV battery power and an on-board MIL-STD 3.0 KW diesel generator (or commercial line power) to automatically recharge the batteries.<BR>Standard Ground Station (SGS):<BR>The TerraSight Standard Ground Station (SGS) is the command console and viewing portal for the Base Expeditionary Targeting and Surveillance Systems-Combined (BETSS-C) system. SGS combines information from a variety of sources to form a single Common Operational Picture (COP). Situational information is displayed in context on a map of the surrounding terrain which may be queried and viewed from multiple perspectives and scales. SGS features include: a layered map consisting of 3D terrain data, mapping and satellite imagery, and live sensor data in real time; Laser Range Finder (LRF) from a CERBERUS sensor and PASS server integrated onto the visual terrain; Cursors on Target (CoT) identify and transmit positions of interest to pin point accuracy; locational data in accordance with US Army CONOPS for SGS BETSS-C; and operator added icons and annotations that provide a descriptive analysis of the surrounding area. The result is a comprehensive understanding of the monitored area and the ability to detect threats and react swiftly and effectively to them.<BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: There are two main objectives of the RFI; supply chain management of spare parts and the repair of cameras.  All spare parts of the above systems will be included in this RFI (Bill of Materials will be provided upon request).  All spare parts are consumable items and are currently maintained by Field Support Representatives (FSR) in theater.  The intent of the RFI is to provide a forum to identify opportunities to provide a performance-based approach for the acquisition of these spare parts and repair of cameras.  An approach that focuses on supply-chain management, requisition wait time, sustainment readiness; and sustainment costs without adding a strain to the Warfighter.  The strategy must also provide visibility to the CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM LCMC).  Supply chain management is the management of suppliers and spare parts within the BETSS-C supply-chain (including forecasting, stock, store, issue and transportation).  There are three cameras within the BETSS-C system that are repairable.  The objective is to have all three cameras repaired within 15 days and functional for up to 4000 hours (MTBF) or up to one year.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at a future date, another notice will be published. <BR><BR>Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for supply-chain management is identified.  If the proposed acquisition strategy utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required on how these organizations will be used.  The proposed acquisition strategy may consider, but it is not required, the use of FAR 51.000 for the use of DLA as a source of supply.    <BR>RESPONSES: Response will be a written submission to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days after the post date of this RFI.  Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages.   Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font.

<a href="mailto:yvette.walker@us.army.mil">USA Engineer District, Nashville</a>
<DESC>PURPOSE:  The Corps of Engineers, Nashville District will host a Presolicitation Workshop for prospective offerors regarding an upcoming Request for Proposal (RFP) to construct a concrete seepage barrier at the main embankment and saddle dam embankment of Center Hill Dam, located near Lancaster, Tennessee.  The RFP will be issued on or about October 2009.  The primary feature of work is installation of an approximate 900-foot long concrete seepage barrier at the Center Hill Dam main embankment.  The barrier will have a minimum 2-foot thickness and extend from elevation 696 to elevation 455 msl.  The barrier will be installed through the existing earthen embankment and underlying limestone foundation.  Portions of the limestone foundation exhibits rock hardness in excess of 19,000 psi.  The work will also include foundation grouting from the gallery in the concrete dam, as well as installation of a foundation grout curtain at the 800-foot long saddle dam.  A grout curtain is currently being installed at the main dam embankment under separate contract.<BR><BR>EVENT DETAILS:  The workshop will be held on July 15 and 16, 2009, at the Center Hill Dam Resource Managers Shop Facility, 158 Resource Lane, Lancaster, TN 38569.  (The Resource Office is on the north side of the dam near Highway 96 just past the intersection of Highways 96 and 155.  The Shop Facility is the metal building past the stone Managers office.) <BR><BR>The workshop will consist of the following:<BR><BR>1.	Beginning at 8:30 a.m. CDT on July 15, 2009, the Corps will present an overview of the project including history, technical information, current work and upcoming contract seepage barrier requirements.  The Corps will also discuss plans to procure construction of the seepage barrier using the formal best value tradeoff selection process.  The Corps Center Hill Seepage Rehab team is considering either a traditional Firm Fixed Price Contract or use of the Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) delivery method.  ECI is an integrated project delivery method.  In the case of the proposed Center Hill work, the Government and contractor would collaborate to complete the base work, preconstruction services.  During the base effort, the Government and contractor would take the Governments 85% complete in-house design, incorporate the means and methods of the selected contractor, develop the technical details based on the Governments plans and the contractors approach, determine the schedule and the target price based on FAR 52.216-17, Incentive Price Revision  Successive Targets.  It is the Governments intention to exercise the option for construction, establish a firm fixed price for the construction phase after completing the design and prior to starting the construction.  The morning workshop session will conclude with a presentation on how ECI could be structured for the Center Hill work.  Following the presentations there will be an open forum to allow questions and comments from prospective bidders.<BR><BR>2.  	Beginning at 2:00 p.m. CDT on July 15, 2009, a site tour will allow viewing of the sites and access. <BR><BR>3.  	Beginning at 9:00 a.m. CDT on July 16, 2009, prospective prime offerors are encouraged to participate in individual discussions with Corps team members.  During these discussions, the Corps will seek input from offerors regarding technical approach, constructability, and alternative contracting strategies.  These discussions will be held in confidence, and will be scheduled once registered.<BR><BR>EVENT REGISTRATION:  Prospective offerors wishing to participate in the workshop are encouraged to register for this event by providing the following information, no later than 1:00 p.m. CDT on July 2, 2009, to Contract Specialist Yvette Walker via email at yvette.walker@usace.army.mil:  (1) Name of firm; (2) Firms CAGE and/or DUNS number; (3) Name and position title of the primary point-of-contact and their telephone number and email address; (4) Number of attendees participating in this workshop.

Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSAF3460898H50120007 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) IE350 Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy with X-max 80 Silicon Drift Detector. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) requires an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system to be installed on a Zeiss Ultra 60 Field Emission (FE) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology's NanoFab Operations Group.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) IE350 Energy Dispersive Spectrometer with X-max 80 Silicon Drift Detector, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>EDS system quoted must be able to be installed on an existing Zeiss Ultra 60 Field Emission (FE) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)</p>
<p>1. EDS detector:</p>
<p>&bull; The energy dispersive X-ray detector must be a silicon drift chamber principle (SDD) unit, with no need for liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling</p>
<p>&bull; The detector must guarantee a minimum X-ray energy resolution of 129 eV at Mn K&alpha;. Resolution must be guaranteed in accordance with ISO15632:2002. Stronger consideration will be given to detectors that guarantee higher (lower energy) resolution</p>
<p>&bull; The detector must provide a total active area of &ge;50 mm&sup2; (to facilitate high-count rates at lower SEM beam energies and small SEM beam probe sizes). Stronger consideration will be given to larger active area detectors<br /><br />&bull; The detector must be enclosed in a vacuum to prevent the absorption of low energy X-rays by gas molecules between the detector window and the SDD sensor</p>
<p>2. EDS analysis software must:</p>
<p>&bull; Acquire and display EDS spectra, and spectral elemental maps and line scans</p>
<p>&bull; Synthesize spectra of compounds or pure element standards</p>
<p>&bull; Successfully correct for image drift while acquiring maps, line scans or spectra</p>
<p>&bull; Include a comprehensive X-ray pulse pile-up correction algorithm to remove sum peaks from the spectrum, and thus improve the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis</p>
<p>&bull; Include navigational software providing systematic guidance for inexperienced and/or infrequent users. Since the system will be installed in a multi-user facility (accessible to qualified NIST and external users) ease of use will be given strongest consideration</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability Factor, Stronger Consideration will be given to the quotations that offer systems which demonstrate larger active area detectors than that required as a minimum requirement and systems which demonstrate higher (lower energy) resolution. Strongest Consideration will be given to the quotations that offer systems which demonstrate ease of use.</p>
<p>Technical capability, and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal importance in price. If Technical Capability, and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>1. Visual and physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.<br />2. Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.</p>

<p>Name Brand Justification for Multi-Parameter Water Quality Logger</p>
<p>The YSI 6600 V2-4 Sonde is a unique, state-of-the-art multiparameter, water quality instrument that is designed for use ins freshwater and seawater up to depths of 61 meters. The instrument is capable of operating in a self-powering mode from an internal power supply using a set of eight (8) "C" batteries for 75 days or more with a full sensor payload at a 15-minute sampling interval. This reduces the number of field servicing trips during the year, which is essential since the study site is a day drive away.</p>
<p>The tidal dynamics in the estuary require that the Water Quality Sonde not exceed 3.5" in diameter, 21.6" in length. A bigger diameter would result in the Sonde penetrating the sediments, and thus potentially damaging it, instead of sampling the water column.</p>
<p>The YSI 6600 V2-4 is capable of having field-replaceable probes for the Dissolved Oxygen, Conductivity, Temperature, pH, ORP, Turbidity, Chlorophyll, Rhodamine and Blue-Green Algae Sensors. The data needed to be collected is critical during a sampling year. Shipping a Sonde back in order to replace these probes, would mean lost data and time. Being able to replace the Dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, pH, and Chlorophyll in the field is essential for the research study.</p>
<p>On the YSI 6600 V2-4 each of the optical sensors has their own dedicated wiping system for anti-fouling protection and improved data quality. This reduces the number of field servicing trips during a study, which is essential due to the distance of the field site.</p>
<p>The YSI 6600 V2-4 uses Luminescent "Life Time" Dissolved Oxygen measurement technique that is capable of measuring dissolved oxygen in the range of 0-20 mg/l with an accuracy of +/- 0.1 mg/l; and in the range of 0 - 200% saturation with an accuracy of +/- 1%. The study site is very dynamic with oxygen concentrations changing within minutes so it is essential that the response time be less than one minute under all flow conditions. The YSI 6600 V2-4 is the only sonde that allows for this.</p>
<p>The YSI 6600 v2-4 has the ability to measure depths within +/- 0.01 ft for 0-30 feet. The highly dynamic tidal variation at the study site makes it imperative that we know the water depth during the sampling region. By accurately knowing the depth of the water column, we will be able to calculate if fluxes from the pore water are important.</p>
<p>THE YSI 6600 V2-4 is accurate +/- 0.15 degrees C. The data collected must be able to measure temperature with this sensitivity or greater so we can correlate temperature dependencies with phytoplankton species present.</p>
<p>THE YSI 6600 V2-4 measures pH in the range of 0-14 with an accuracy of +/- 0.2. The research field sample has large variations in pH so it is essential that the entire pH range can be measured.</p>
<p>The instrument calculates salinity based on the conductivity and<br />temperature measurements in the range of 0-70. It is essential that salinity be determined by these parameters with is the international accepted way for measuring salinity.</p>
<p>The YSI 6600 V2-4 comes with a user-friendly software program providing communication and data processing that is presented in both report and graphical form, and data statistics will be automatically generated and displayed for Min, Max, Mean, and Standard Deviation. This allows for easy identification of anomalies in the data without having to have an individual graph the data.</p>
<p>The YSI 6600 V2-4 have secondary backup seals win all the sensor ports. This is essential in protecting the internal electronics from the seawater environment. All sensor ports have secondary backup seals, thus protecting the internal electronics from the environment.</p>
<p>The 6-Series line of instruments, including the 6600 sonde, is manufactured and distributed by YSI Inc. of Yellow Springs, OH, USA. The YSI 6600 V2-4 to the best of our knowledge is the only Sonde that will allow us to collect pH, Temperature, Salinity, Chlorophyll-a, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen with one instrument. These parameters must all be measured with one instrument due to the size restrictions at the study site. Due to the dynamics of the study site, the precision and accuracy needed for the research, the YSI 6600 V2-4 Sonde is the only multi-parameter Water Quality Sonde available.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>     The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract for a Computed Micro Tomography X-Ray Machine (specific description below).  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  The announcement number is F1TBAP9092A001.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This is a full and open competition.

Background:  

     We are seeking a tool to investigate the microstructures of composite materials ranging from energetic materials to concretes.  We would like to make non-destructive measurements and construct a 3-D renderings which could then be input into a computer model, as well as use these microstructures to determine characteristics of the compacted materials such as specific surface area of primary particles and particle/pore geometry characteristics.  Particle sizes of organic explosive might be as small as several microns, while the aggregate in concrete would be considerably larger, and therefore require samples greater than 65 mm in diameter.
     We are specifically interested in taking the 3-D structures provided by the XCMT machine and turning it into a computational mesh. (The 3-D image needs to be in a CAD format.)  The necessary outcome is to take the actual internal structure and generate a computational mesh in order to perform analysis on that known structure.  


The requirement consists of the following items:  
     1 Computed Micro Tomography X-Ray Machine

Description:  
Minimum Requirements are as follows:
1.	At a 5 mm sample size, 1 micron resolution is required.
2.	At a 50 mm sample size, 10 micron resolution is required.
3.	Largest sample size to be at least 65 mm diameter by 100 mm long.
4.	The system must have the ability to handle materials that have similar material contrast. For example, the system must be able to resolve table sugar dispersed in a polyurethane binder, as well as fine aluminum powder (~20 micron) dispersed in a polyurethane binder.
5.	The system must be able to examine samples that are irregularly shaped.
6.	The system must effectively handle a large variety of materials including carbon fiber composites, polymer foams, machined parts, metal specimens and high explosives with large range of Z materials.
7.	The system must be able to convert the data to 3-D computer generated images.
8.	 Clarification/Revision on size restrictions: The system shall be installed through a 7.0 foot high, 5 foot 3 inch wide door. The system must be shipped in such a way as to be deliverable through this door using standard dunnage (forklift, straps, carts, etc.). The dimensions of the door will allow for a maximum height with dunnage of 6 feet 8 inches. The system must be deliverable without causing scraping damage to the flooring.
9.	 Software for quantitative analysis and for presentation.
10.	Must produce negligible X-Ray signature outside of instrument so that no dosimeter is required for personnel when working with or around the XCMT continuously (2,000 hours per year).
11.	 All parts/components of this system must be new. No recycled, refurbished, or otherwise used parts are permitted in this system.
12.	 Utility Requirements:  The vendor will provide all electronic controllers as well as interconnection and power cables required for operation using 110 VAC, 60 Hz power. The system can be air cooled or water cooled.  If water is required for instrument cooling, the chilling unit must be provided with the instrument and operate using 100V, 60Hz power. Vendor will describe in writing the utility requirements (including connections and capacity) upon contract approval so that appropriate infrastructure arrangements can be made prior to shipment of XCMT.
13.	The vendor will provide a copy of all documentation and user instructions prior to shipment.
14.	The vendor will include in the proposal the approximate delivery and installation dates of the system.  ***Delivery shall be no later than 20 weeks ADC!!***  Include the cost of shipping in proposals.  
15.	On site training for two operators is required.  This training should cover proper machine operation and software use.  Include this training in the cost of the system.  
16.	The vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard warranty and the duration of the standard warranty. 
17.	No minimum specifications have been specified regarding the x-ray energy, detector type, and speed of reconstruction.  X-ray energy and detector shall be evaluated based on their effect on the sample size, resolution, and ability to contrast multiple-low Z materials mixed with high Z metals. The contractor can use whatever energy s/he deems necessary to meet the requirements.  The speed of reconstruction must not exceed 16 hours.  

     All interested vendors will be given an opportunity to set up a scheduled time to present their technical capabilities to the government.


     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-31.

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to answer questions from industry:

Question:
What are the hours of operation for the Gaithersburg facility as well as the JFK International Airport Facility?

Answer:
The trucks will need to be escorted on campus, so the hours will be at least partially dependent on the availability of our technician.  In general, we should be able to have trucks and rigging equipment on campus between the hours of 7 am and 5 pm.  We do not know the specific hours of operation of the JFK facility but will attempt to find out before the site visit.   

Question:
Will special identification be required by riggers and/or truckers to enter either of these facilities?

Answer:
NIST will need to know in advance the names of the drivers and riggers so that their names can be entered in the visitor database.  If drivers and riggers are U.S. citizens, this information is needed 24 hours before their arrival at the NIST campus.  For non-U.S. citizens, we will need two weeks lead time in order for them to be able to access the site.  We will try to find out what the requirements are for identification at the JFK Facility.

Question:
Will there be space made available to leave trailers and rigging equipment?

Answer:
Well have to look into this question.  It would seem that we should be able to have some limited space available for rigging equipment to be kept during the duration of this project.

Question:
Will we be allowed to take pictures of the steel while on the site visit?  

Answer:
Yes, photographs will be permitted during the site visit.

 

All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>Some Answers to your questions:
1)       Is it possible to review a copy of the previous real estate summary map, NAVFAC Dwg No. 1296803?

This drawing is a Navy document, not Coast Guard

2)       Should our offer include any references or qualifications in addition to the information requested in the solicitation?

I will leave the need for references and qualifications up to you.

3)       Will the monuments requested for this project need to be set on interior boundary lines as well as exterior boundary lines?

No.  Not both


4)       Will monuments be required were the boundary line is coincident with the San Francisco Bay?

 No, I don't think so.  But that will have to be determined later.

5)       Is it possible to visit the site prior to submittal of our offer on this project to gain a better understanding of site specific conditions which will affect the cost of this project?

This is a closed site and I would have to check with Sector SF to see if they would be ameniable to visits.  But we would prefer not.  I would think they could go on line and see Coast Guard area.

A breakdown of the other entitles that have title to portions of the island?  Approximate area/location of the Coast Guard property.  Is this going to be a survey of nearly the entire island, or a specific smaller portion.  Is there a general understanding as to what areas of the island are owned by the Coast Guard?

Rest of Island is owned by Navy.  We only want a survey of the Coast Guard property.

A lot of the questions being asked will need to be determined at the discression of the awarded vendor.

Synopsis:


This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the Government. Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research to identify potential sources of supply to support Navy Fourth Fleet from a platform located in or near Panama City, Panama.

Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is an agency of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA provides supply support and logistics services to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and other federal agencies (customers). The Subsistence Operations, a Directorate of DSCP, is planning to award a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) five-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract. The estimated solicitation issue is Summer / Fall 2009. The intended contract base period is anticipated to be 18 months with two one (1) year option periods and a final option period of 18 months. It is anticipated that there will be a ramp up period although the actual time for ramp up may be subject to change depending on Market Research findings. DSCP Subsistence Supplier Operations is seeking information with the intent to solicit, award and establish a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) service platform in or near Panama City, Panama.  

The SPV Program has been successfully implemented around the world. There are some Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) SPV open solicitations currently on the street. Interested vendors are encouraged to view active solicitations from other regions by visiting FedBizOps.gov.  This will provide prospective offerors some idea of Contract Terms and Conditions, Statement of Work, Contract Administrative Data, Solicitation Provisions, Price Definitions, Rebates and Discounts Language, 832 requirements, Evaluation Criteria/ Past Performance and Reporting Requirements, etc.  The SPV is the primary distribution channel (single distributor) for procurement and delivery of a full range of commercial and Government Furnished Material (GFM) food and beverage items in a geographical region. Customers order directly from the Prime Vendor via the Subsistence Total Ordering and Receipt Electronic System (STORES) with a scheduled delivery date (commonly referred to as Required Delivery Date (RDD). It is anticipated that customers (estimated at nine) will order supplies approximately two times per month. The estimated annual dollar value is $3.8M. Please note that the numbers of customers, frequency of ordering and dollar value are estimates and are subject to change.  The SPV provides all Subsistence products for which it has been authorized to distribute by DSCP Subsistence (via STORES customer ordering catalogs). Designated contracting instruments include, but are not limited to, Manufacturer Pricing Agreements (MPAs) and National Allowance Pricing Agreements (NAPAs) for some Navy Standard Core Menu items. All commercial items are brand name specific or generic products that are identified by a National Stock Number (NSN) or Local Stock Number (LSN).  GFM items are generally ration type items.

DSCP is required to have quantitative metrics to evaluate contractor performance. These include, but are not limited to, Contracting Officer Representative (COR) reports, food audit reports, Not in Stock (NIS) reports, Fill Rate, Rejection reports, CPARS and product recalls. One measure currently utilized under current contracts is fill rate. This measure only allows for inclusion of items defined as usage items by the customer. The fill rate metric is calculated by number of cases delivered divided by number of cases ordered. DSCP is seeking ideas, recommendations, and other metrics based on commercial practices used for evaluating contractor performance. 

Your responses are requested by the close of business on July 20, 2009 and may be sent via mail or email. If email is your preferred source of transmission, we recommend that you look for a confirmation within 48 hours of submission by the point of contact provided below. Any responses received after this date may not be reviewed or considered in our contract formation process.

<DESC>This modification is to change the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) contact information and to separate the requirement into a basic contract line item (CLINS) with two optional CLINS.  The PCO is Sandra Scharn-Stevens, 760-939-9665.  The previous synopsis stated "The AMRAAM HWIL simulation system shall be built to specific operational parameters to test missile versions AIM 120B through C-7."  The solicitation has been revised to make CLIN 0001 a simulation system for C-7 only.  Legacy versions and incidental on-site support are now optional CLINS.

As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA&rsquo;s P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration. The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants&rsquo; existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA&rsquo;s workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project&rsquo;s access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines. Project goals and objectives for the courthouse are to improve energy efficiency of building by installing high-efficiency windows; upgrade building security and safety by replacing windows. SCOPE OF WORK Design Stage services and Construction Stage work are to be performed by the DB Contractor. Design Stage services include providing Design Concept and Design Development Phase services. Construction Stage work includes preparing construction documents and performing construction in conformance with the project requirements. The scope of services for the Design Stage will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents. The scope of services for the Construction Stage will require at a minimum: preparation of construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), building information and modeling (BIM), CPM scheduling, scope management, value engineering, maintaining construction records, utilizing an electronic project management system in order to manage project documents, monitoring construction costs, commissioning, post-construction contract services (PCCS), abatement, demolition, construction, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The Design-Build contractor shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the Design-Build contractor shall have complete responsibility for design and construction of the facility, including timely delivery within the project budget. PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a &ldquo;short list&rdquo; of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals (the short list will NOT be published in FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)). In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement. In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically after 06/29/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors&rsquo; and subcontractors&rsquo; use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER SOLICITATION NO.

The proposed maintenance dredging would remove up to 40,000 cubic yards of sediment from the outer section of the inlet to 18 feet below mean low water level with a 2 feet allowable overdepth (approximately 25,000 CY), and the redeveloping spot shoal from the 12 foot deep section (approximately 3,000 CY) as basic work. The maintenance operation also includes advanced maintenance dredging to 18 feet MLW of two deposition areas as options: one 600 ft long and 50ft wide adjacent to the outer reach at the north channel line, and one 500ft long 50 ft wide adjacent to the outer reach at the south channel line (approximately 12,000 CY).<br /><br />The contractor is required to maintain a daily production rate of at least 2,000 cubic yards per day. It is anticipated that dredging/disposal would take place within the approximate time period of September 2009 to October 2009. Plans/ Specs for the subject project would be available on/about May 5, 2009 with bid opening on/about June 15, 2009. <br /><br />This procurement is being solicited as a SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE. The applicable NAICS CODE is 237990, Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities. The small business size is $20,000,000.00. The SIC Code is 1629, Heavy Construction, not elsewhere classified.
