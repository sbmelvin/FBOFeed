For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>Pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2512(a)) (TAA), Federal acquisitions of supplies may be made only from offerors that will supply products of an eligible country under any of the free trade agreements entered into pursuant to the TAA. An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Shunra Storm Box is a Virtual Enterprise Network Appliance (VECRAS)w VE Modeler and a 10/100 4 port Card . It is a high- performancenetwork appliance that functions as a bridge, switch or router. Italters the speed at which traffic traverses the local area network(LAN) test - bed to expose packets to the same impairments to which theywould be subjected on the wide area network (WAN).  IRM/SMART requires the Shunra Storm Box to be procured on a brandname only basis . Therefore, 41 USC 253(c) (1), only one responsiblesource and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements,implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(C), iscited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one vendor's uniquequalifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather,the products identified by the brand name herein have been determinedto be the only items that maximize the Government's existinginvestment. The rationale for this brand name only justification isbased on several factors. A foundational consideration is that thenature of performance testing technology is highly specialized,requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in anygiven product. While there are competing products that have similarfunctionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is noteasily transferable. The cost in training, experience and projectdelay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings tothe government. Furthermore, as the program is currently leveragingthis same technology to simulate load and facilitate performancetesting in its laboratory environments, the rest of the SMART system isalready configured to integrate with the Shunra Storm Box, and allestablished test methodologies and processes have been formulatedaround our understanding of this technology.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This project generally consists of placing riprap in St. Johns Bayou between STA 1+40 and STA 2+15 and riprap along the left descending bank between STA 2+15 and 7+75 in New Madrid County, Missouri. The project site is approximately 0.5 mile east of New Madrid, Missouri. The purpose of this project is to protect the existing floodgate structure by extending the riprap apron at the outfall of the floodgate. A portion of the left descending bank will also be protected by placing r200 along the slope to prevent further scour along the bank.
