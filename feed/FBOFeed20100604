<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL), Pittsburgh, PA has a requirement for Public information campaign for disseminating NIOSH personal protective equipment knowledge to Healthcare and Public Services Sub Sector.
<p>This requirement is solicited as a small-business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13. The period of performance is one year from date of contract award.<br />PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this contract is to provide communications support services focused on<br />developing and initiating a public information campaign for NPPTL to expand its<br />existing capabilities so that it will be able to produce and disseminate materials aimed at<br />a broader range of audiences with differing levels of understanding of the technical<br />subject matter of the Laboratory's activities.<br />These materials will be focused on the core NPPTL responsibilities that focus on workers<br />who rely on PPE and technologies in the Health Care and Social Assistance (HCSA)<br />sector (specifically health care subsectors including ambulatory services, hospitals, and<br />residential care facilities) as well as the Public Safety Sub Sector (PSS), with an emphasis<br />on fire fighters and emergency response personnel.<br />In 2006, the HCSA sector employed over 17.8 million workers, with most (82%) working<br />in health care. HCSA sector workers face potential exposures to unknown hazardous<br />agents contaminating first receivers; emerging infectious diseases such as SARS, avian<br />influenza, and others; and exposure to a variety of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. High<br />hazard chemical use and use of other potentially hazardous new technologies continues to<br />grow in health care settings; awareness of these hazards and appropriate workplace<br />protections will be required. The ability of the HCSA sector to deal with emergencies<br />including natural disasters, epidemics of pandemic influenza or other contagious diseases,<br />and intentional attacks on the population has important implications both for HCSA<br />workers and the community at large.<br />The mission of the PSS research program is to reduce or eliminate occupational injuries,<br />illnesses, and fatalities among workers in Law Enforcement, Fire Fighting, Corrections<br />and Emergency Medical Services. In 2006, the PSS included over 3.5 million employees<br />and about one-half of these workers are volunteer fire fighters and emergency medical<br />services volunteers. PPE is critical to these workers to provide personal protection to<br />reduce exposures from a number of inhalation, dermal, and injury hazards.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is 70181-A-Q073 and is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-32) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
This procurement is a small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS classification code is 334290 and PSC code is 5820. 
SPECIFICATIONSThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is requesting quotes for satellite radio telemetry tags to deploy on polar bears. 
LINE ITEMSPlease provide a detailed price schedule for the following items:Deliverables: Fifteen units of satellite radio tags and associated mounting hardware, as described below in the salient characteristics section, to be delivered to Eric Regehr at the USFWS (address above) no later than 01 August 2010.
Salient characteristics:"	Radio tags:o	PTT transmitter required to send locations via system Argos. A VHF beacon is not required.o	Wet-dry sensor required.o	Small size and shape factor appropriate for mounting on a polar bear ear. Maximum dimensions are approximately 41x30x18 mm.o	Maximum weight is approximately 33 g.o	Must be encased in robust packaging (e.g., epoxy) to withstand stresses of animal behavior and the marine environment, which means waterproof, salt proof, and unbreakable. The antennae must be sufficiently durable to withstand icing.o	Battery life must be sufficient for at least 200 transmission days using 4 hours of transmission per day at a 90 second repetition rate.o	Must have a flexible, user-programmable transmission schedule.	"	Hardware to mount the radio tags to the ears of polar bears:o	Mounting hardware base should consist of stainless steel platform bonded to the eartag.  Footprint area of the platform on which the tag is attached must not exceed the size of the eartag.  o	A post with approximate diameter 0.5 cm and washer system are required to attach the tag through a hole in the bear's ear.  Platform and washer surfaces that contact the bear must be rubberized to prevent cold dame to the bear.  o	Mounting hardware should be as light as possible and must not exceed a weight of 25 grams.  o	Mounting hardware must have undergrone previous field trials on polar bears.  This is critical because these types of mounting systems are prone to failure in the Arctic environment.

<DESC>NATIONAL COORDINATING CENTER FOR THE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEMIC MECHANICS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE -RFP HRS37925<br />The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting to obtain the services to provide a National Coordinating Center for the Demonstration Program for the Development and Establishment of Systemic Mechanics for the Prevention and Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease for the Division of Services for Children with Special Health Needs, Maternal Child Health Bureau (MCHB), HRSA. The proposed acquisition listed herein is a Full and Open Competition. In 2004 Congress enacted and the President signed into law P.L. 108-357, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Section 712 of P.L. 108-357 authorized a demonstration program for the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease. The legislation was to address "inclusion of primary and secondary medical strategies for children and adults with sickle cell disease as medical assistance under the Medicaid program" and was enacted for two purposes: the creation of an optional medical assistance program for individuals with sickle cell diseases for treatment and education, genetic counseling and other services to prevent mortality and decrease morbidity from sickle cell disease; and the creation of a demonstration program [hereafter termed the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Program (SCDTP)] under Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As per the legislation, the demonstration program is to be carried out through two mechanisms: a grant program and a contract. This solicitation addresses the specific legislative requirements for the contract. HRSA/MCHB will enter into a contract with an entity to serve as the national coordinating center for the demonstration program described by the legislation: P.L.103-357, Section 712(c.3.A). It is expected that the entity shall have at least 5 years of experience of recognized expertise with the care and treatment of sickle cell disease. The overall purpose of the contract is to establish a national coordinating center (Sickle Cell Disease National Coordinating Center [SCD-NCC]) that will coordinate the activities of the grant entities funded under the demonstration program. Upon award of the contract, the HRSA/MCHB project officer will identify the grant entities that the Contractor shall work with throughout the life of the contract. In addition to serving as a coordinating center for the demonstration program, the legislation indicates specific activities for this program. In summary, the SCD-NCC shall collect, coordinate, monitor, and distribute data, best practices, and findings regarding the activities funded under grants (the Networks) under the demonstration program; identify a model protocol for eligible entities with respect to the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease; identify educational materials regarding the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease; and to prepare and submit a final report that includes recommendations regarding the effectiveness of the demonstration program conducted under this subsection and such direct outcome measures as (1)T he number and type of health care resources utilized (such as emergency room visits, hospital visits, length of stay, and physician visits for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease); and (2) The number of individuals that were tested and subsequently received genetic counseling for the sickle cell trait. The Contractor shall perform a comprehensive outcome evaluation of the efforts delivered through this contract and develop a web portal for data entry that is HL-7 compatible and utilizes current NLM messaging guidelines. Evaluation of the individual projects (data collection, identification of treatment protocols and educational materials, etc.) supported by this contract shall be reported along with the evaluation of the overall demonstration program supported by funding. The program evaluation effort and web portal development shall be initiated within the first six months of the contract and be completed by the Contractor during the final year of implementation of this contract-year four (4). The projects' evaluations, ongoing during the entire contract effort, are analyzed by the Contractor during the final project phase in order to determine the extent to which the outcomes proposed with the inception of the effort and reviewed/revised during program implementation have achieved what was intended to be achieved. The anticipated period of performance is for a twelve (12) month base year with three 12 month option years. This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) will be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov approximately fifteen (15) days of this notice and can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations- Office of Acquisition Management Policy, Division of Contracting Operations. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance/posting of the RFP. It shall be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this website for the RFP and any amendments to the RFP. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources.

<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 333314 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Molecular Imaging Program is currently conducting research in designing, developing and testing newly targeted imaging agents for the detection and characterization of cancer. These imaging agents include specific MRI, PET, radionuclide, and optical probes. The proposed acquisition will be used for bioluminescence imaging of animals and their tumors for the pre-clinical development section of the laboratory.</p>
<p>There are currently fluorescence imagers, but no bioluminescence imagers in the lab, which are required to view more sensitive images. The requested imager will validate that the exogenous probes developed in the MIP are co-localizing with transfected cells in the tumor which express bioluminescent enzymes, such as luciferase. In addition, the lab is testing a new type of nano-particle, bioluminescence-resonance energy transfer quantum dots, as a promising self-illuminating nano-particle for in vivo imaging that needs more sensitivity on the camera then what is currently in use in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics PI 0100 Photon Imager:</p>
<p>&bull; Intensified Charge Coupled Device (ICCD) camera with High Resolution, Peltier-Cooled and with Fi.4 Fixed Lens<br />&bull; ICCD camera capable of detecting single photons and recording the position, size and time of each event in list format<br />&bull; Detection System capable of acquiring data exceeding 50,000 photons/s/mm2<br />&bull; Frame rate must provide a minimum 23ms/full frame with no binning<br />&bull; System must use an ICCD camera which provides settings other than priori including exposure and f-stop (used in most cooled CCD cameras)<br />&bull; ICCD camera must do real photon counting, so data can be stored as a list mode (position and timing of every photon detected) enabling to record kinetics for a period superior to 24 hours with reasonable file size<br />&bull; ICCD camera noise should be less than 100 counts per second for the entire image <br />&bull; The ICCD should have less than 50-100 noise events per second<br />&bull; Four View Module for Photon Imager-Hardware add-on giving simultaneously 4 views of the same animal, dorsal, ventral, left side, right side, for precise localization of signal and quantification<br />&bull; MacroLens Module for Photon Imager-Add-on for high speed resolution imaging, with the continuous selection of the magnification between extreme positions. The maximum field of view is 20 mm x 15 mm and offers a resolution of 20&mu;m. The minimal field of view is 4 mm x 3 mm and offers a resolution of 4&mu;m. Any intermediate position between the maximum and minimal field of view (FOV) can be used. Must be compatible with both fluorescence and bioluminescence<br />&bull; Continuous FOV from 8x6 cm (one mouse) to 24x18cm (five mice)<br />&bull; Anesthesia System with digital flow meter, O2 digital flow meter, TEC 3 Isoflurane Vaporizer with adapter for bottle key filler, Induction box, dual line (1 for induction, 1 for Photon Imager), scavenging system</p>

The acquisition is fee-for-service type.<br /><br />The Office of the Clinical Director is part of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program (NIMH-DIRP). The DIRP conducts clinical research designed to expedite the exchange of information between scientists and clinicians so that basic findings can be moved quickly from the laboratory setting to the treatment of patients at the bedside. Clinical research, including natural history protocols and clinical trials, is of primary importance to the research mission of the NIMH. The clinical research portion of the program comprises tenured and tenure-track clinical investigators, staff clinicians, and fellows in more than a dozen clinical Branches and free-standing Sections. There are approximately 120 NIMH protocols, which accounted for approximately 7,000 inpatient days and 7,000 outpatient visits in FY09. The mission of the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) is to ensure that subjects participating in NIMH protocols receive the highest quality clinical care. This is accomplished by the activities of the Human Subjects Protection Unit, the NIMH Intramural Research Program Protocol Office, the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board (IRB), Clinical Fellowship Training activities, and the Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Service. The overall responsibilities of the office include the following: oversight of the clinical care provided to our research subjects, management of the NIMH protocol review process, administration of the quality assurance program, authorization of medical staff credentials, and allocation of Clinical Center (CC) resources.<br /><br />The proposed acquisition will provide the Office of the Clinical Director with residents specializing in psychosomatic medicine, a subspecialty of general psychiatry, from Georgetown University Hospital in a collaboration to provide these residents with access to subjects participating in clinical research in the NIH Clinical Center.<br /><br />Georgetown University School of Medicine, under the auspices of the Medstar-Georgetown Medical Center, is a premier medical research institution. This institution offers future physicians a superior and supportive environment for learning the science of medicine. In addition, Georgetown University Psychiatry Department offers particular faculty expertise in psychosomatic medicine in areas that supplement researchers at the NIMH.&nbsp;Georgetown University can provide residents that are uniquely trained in psychosomatic medicine - Georgetown University sponsors a new, highly competitive, advanced clinical training program in this area of expertise for its training partners, the NIMH Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Service (part of the NIMH-DIRP) and Washington Hospital Center.&nbsp; The residents have previously been competitively selected and accepted for this specialized program.<br /><br />This training will provide the OCD with specialized services to assist in the provision of care with the following services:
<p>- Assessment, treatment and follow-up of research subjects with psychiatric disorders in conjunction with ongoing studies in other NIH intramural research programs;<br />- Implementation of diagnostic plans to complement multidisciplinary treatment plans; and <br />- Psychotherapeutic intervention for research subjects in inpatient studies.<br /><br />In addition, this training offers the NIMH a unique opportunity to work with highly skilled clinicians who can contribute to the research mission of the NIH and its Intramural Research Program.<br /><br />Georgetown University School of Medicine previously had&nbsp;worked with the NIH/NIMH in collaboration on&nbsp;these specialized training programs and thus is considered a uniquely qualified source to perform this requirement.

Background
The National Park System is required to address user/visitor capacities in a variety of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) mandated processes.  Examples of these processes include general management plans, wild and scenic river plans, transportation improvement plans, and resource related management plans, etc.  As a result, there is a need to conduct visitor use/recreation related research to inform these decisions outlined in such documents.  In addition, subject matter representation can sometimes be requested beyond a reporting time frame on studies conducted by the contractor.  Such studies are organized into four generic categories of interest including:
	Visitor use and impact measurement and monitoring	Computer-based simulation modeling of pedestrian and vehicle systems	Studies to understand visitor perceptions in order to inform user capacity planning and management	Expert witness/consultation services for planning processes and litigations
The contractor will be required to develop, implement, analyze, report, synthesize and present upon studies deemed necessary by the National Park Service (NPS).  Moreover, the seamless integration of the studies described above is necessary in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of how travel systems behave under different conditions and how this affects visitors' experience.  This requires the contractor to possess thorough knowledge of recreation management principles, visitor capacity, research methods, analysis and reporting mechanisms.  Additionally, appropriate software commonly used for these tasks is necessary.  The NPS has applied a variety of software to study and communicate visitor use related issues in protected area management.  However, it is important for collaborators to communicate these appropriate means to conducting such studies in the response to orders under the BPA.

Scope of Services
Definition of Tasks
Task 1. Visitor use and impact measurement and monitoring
The contractor will provide a comprehensive and exhaustive ability to develop, implement, analyze, and report upon studies that inform the NPS on issues surrounding visitor use and associated resource related impacts.  Impact measurement and monitoring could include, for example, visitor activity/soundscape perception surveys, site visitor counts, vehicle specific traffic counts, noise source measurements, ambient sound measurement per NPS protocols, or a combination of the above.
Task 2. Computer-based simulation modeling, including noise maps
Computer based simulation modeling and associated scenario analysis would be provided for the NPS.  This would include developing a base model describing existing use conditions.  Once developed, scenario analysis could inform alternatives development, visitor use management strategies, and/or percentages of time that indicators are found to be out of standard.  Computer based simulation could include development of noise maps, Monte Carlo simulations, and other modeling services to help inform planning and management activities.  Noise maps can be completed to show the impact of visitor transportation within a park and to help inform various planning and management alternatives related to visitor use.  For example, a noise map can help show the geographic noise impacts of various visitor vehicle access numbers and can show the distance that a hiker would have to travel along a particular trail before noise from nearby roads would decrease to natural ambient levels.
Task 3. Studies to understand visitor perceptions to inform user capacity planning and management
The contractor shall perform research to that examines visitor perceptions of various aspects of the visitor experience in national parks. Visitor perception research could include advanced soundscape perception surveys, interviews, and observational techniques, along with post processing and correlative analysis using state-of-the-art perceptual models.  Results from such research will be integrated into computer based simulation modeling to test how different levels of visitor use/noise affect visitor experience. In addition, capacity related decisions are value-based and the contractor will provide expert opinion about the implications of study results.
Task 4. Data to support modeling, planning processes and management actions
The contractor shall provide data as needed to support park planning and modeling efforts.  Such data could consist of visitor counts/survey from previous park research or noise level/spectral data from previously measured sound sources.  Such data is valuable when specific measurements, counts, or other numbers are not available for a situation.Task 5.  Economic Analysis.
[Add Description]

National Park Service Responsibilities

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This solicitation is a Performance Based Acquisition.  The Government may issue one contract or multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation.  Any contract(s) issued as a result of this solicitation shall include Cost Reimbursement terms and conditions. The Government herein anticipates a period of performance of two (2) years with one (1) one-year option period (depending upon the starting maturity of the medical device).  Contracts shall be issued on a best value basis.  HISTORICAL INFORMATION:  No previous history.  The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) has a requirement for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared medical devices for prescreening deployed military forces for Transfusion Transmitted Diseases (TTD) and for blood donor screening for TTDs.  There are both interim and long term goals for this effort.  The interim goal is the development of FDA cleared medical devices for rapid clinical screening assays for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  The long term goal is the development of a FDA cleared rapid and portable medical device for combined/multiplex nucleic acid testing for blood donor screening for HBV, HCV and Human Immunodeficiency virus-1/2 (HIV-1/2) that is suitable for use in a deployed and technologically constrained environment.  The ultimate aim is to be able to screen potential blood donors to produce blood products in the deployed setting with methods that mirror as closely as possible the current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) used to produce products in licensed blood donor centers according standards set by the FDA.  The goals of this solicitation are to develop Rapid Immunological Clinical Screening Assays for HBV and HCV and Rapid Nucleic Acid Test(s) for Blood Donor Screening to Detect and Differentiate HBV, HCV and HIV-1/2.<BR>

<CONTACT>Darrell Hanf, Program Manager, Phone (937) 904-5029, Email darrell.hanf@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span>: The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is developing a strategic purchasing plan for the Air Force's next generation of clinical support service requirements that is efficient and effective. Goals of strategic sourcing are to leverage resources, define common specifications, reduce redundancy, streamline processes, and improve efficiencies with strategically placed contracts or ordering instruments. This request for information seeks industry comments on the future AFMSCC strategy for clinical services. This is a request for information (RFI) only; no contract will result from responses received on this RFI. This is not a Request for Proposal, an Invitation to Bid, or a Request for Quotation. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>: The AFMSCC currently administers and manages a Multiple Award Task Order (MATO), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Clinical Support Services (CSS) contract, which is a 10-year, $1.9 billion program. In an effort to begin strategy development and market research for the next strategic contract vehicle, the AFMSCC is seeking information from sources tha provide contracted health care personnel in Air Force military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) at geographically dispersed Air Force bases in the United States and its territories. The work supports healthcare services provided by Air Force military personnel, DoD civilian employees, and other contract staff. The work could also provide new capabilities at the MTFs when required.</p>
<p>Under the current CSS program, the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) contracts for professional health care personnel to treat patients inside MTFs and designated extensions of MTFs (i.e., health and wellness centers, geographically separated clinics). The AFMS requires numerous medically-related occupations. These include (but are not limited to): physicians, nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists, and dentists supporting inpatient and outpatient facilities and ancillary services as well as medical management services such as case management and utilization management. Clinical support services do not include consulting, advising or subject matter experts. The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code used for the original contracts is: 621111 (Office of Physicians) with a size standard of $9M.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirement</span>: The AFMSCC is initiating development of a new acquisition strategy. The number, scope and geographic coverage for contract personnel, as well as the type of contract and acquisition methodology has not been determined at this time. We are seeking large and small businesses as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity that industry can provide for anticipated clinical service requirements in the United States and its territories. In addition, information is being sought for alternative NAICS used by industry for similar services. This market research is intended to help determine future acquisition strategies and does not affect current contract vehicles at this time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response</span>: Interested businesses capable of recruiting, credentialing, hiring, and placing clinical personnel in medical facilities should respond to the survey questions at the following link: <br /><br />http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/clinicalservicesmarketresearch</p>
<p>The survey may take 30 minutes depending upon the level of services offered by your company. Your willingness to provide the details requested will be invaluable to the Government during this planning phase. Submitting your answers in the survey link above is the Government's preferred data collection method.</p>

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W91CRB-08-R-0073 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 11 August 2008 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center (RDECOM STTC). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, Topic 3. Dismounted Soldier Training Systems. Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Pat Garrity, RDECOM STTC, (407)384-3663, pat.garrity@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: Mr. Richard Boast, Contract Specialist US Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 (407) 208-3290, Richard.Boast1@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). or Ms. Vanessa T. Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 (407) 208-3015.<BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: The Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) and the RDECOM STTC are researching immersive capabilities / enhancements to improve Joint Fires & Effects Trainer System (JFETS).<BR><BR>BACKGROUND.  The Joint Fires and Effects Trainer System (JFETS) will transition into Call For Fire Trainer Increment II Plus (CFFT II Plus)which is a virtual training system that provides an immersive, simulated battlefield to train Field Artillery officers, MOS 13F Fire Support Specialists, and Joint Fires Observers at the generating force level.  JFETS represents a significant opportunity for sustainment training supporting all types of Close Air Support (CAS) terminal control.  This immersive capability removes the student from a traditional classroom setting and places him into an operational environment. However, JFETS, currently configured with multiple modules and cutting-edge environmental displays, is a static trainer housed in a permanent, fixed facility located only at Fort Sill.  The FCOE in its role as supporting operational Field Artillery units and Special Operation Forces is researching possibilities for exporting this immersive capability.  Constraints with respect to the large dimensions, associated transportation/set up costs, and the complexity of the system architecture have forced the FCOE to examine other alternatives.   <BR><BR>PROBLEM STATEMENT.  How do we reasonably duplicate the positive attributes and capabilities of JFETS and make them available to our Operational, Joint, and (authorized) Coalition users?  The FCOE must establish a means to provide a JFETS-like immersive training capability to the field.  The immersive environment is limited in the current generation of simulators.   Potential visualization options are screens/computer displays or Head/Helmet Mounted Displays (HMD).  Screens and computer displays tend to be bulky and/or inadequate.  The current generation of head mounted displays force the student to go in and out of the environment every time he needs to look at an actual map or piece of equipment.<BR><BR>SPECIFIC RESEARCH AREAS.  Development in the HMD has advanced beyond the standard limited virtual capability by providing a completely lightless enclosure, allowing the video to wrap around the student.  Some HMDs utilizing Augmented Virtuality techniques allow the insertion of real-world view into the computer generated image (CGI).  This optical see-through capability would enable the Soldier to view map, compass, and other devices without leaving the virtual environment.  Constructing a more complete virtual environment, while at the same time placing the required tools in that environment, will allow the student to correctly perform critical tasks in a high stress situation.  This exportable immersive capability represents a potential solution for operation unit sustainment training for controlling CAS.  Fielded observed fire trainers, using computer monitors or display screens do not have this level of fidelity nor can they achieve the desired training end state.  While there is a head mounted display which can support the CFFT, it provides a minimal virtual capability, forcing the student move in and out of the training environment.  This training gap must be resolved to progress from artificial classroom to a realistic operational environment.  The advanced HMD capability integrated into the existing call-for-fire training systems would accomplish the FCOEs mission to export the JFETS immersive training capability to both generating and operational forces. At this time, it is anticipated that this effort will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $2M subject to budgeting constraints.<BR>Reference Documents to include White paper Submissions are provided at http://www.rdecom.army.mil/STTC/baa.html<BR><BR><BR>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  <BR><BR>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: <BR><BR>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the objectives identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1600 EDT 18 June 2010. No extensions will be granted.   Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  The White Paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  <BR><BR>The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:<BR>(1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.   Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  <BR>(2) Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed solution will meet the goal of the research topic.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential approach and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving JFETS should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered. <BR>(3) Personnel: The qualifications, experience, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for the proposal objectives.<BR> (4) Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offerors history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.<BR> (5) Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.<BR><BR>Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation.   White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted. <BR><BR>Upon completion of white paper evaluations, the Government may issue a request for proposal letter to the qualified offeror(s), who best meet the program objectives. If proposals are solicited, proposals are due NLT 1600 16 Aug 2010.  The requirements for proposal preparation and submission can be found at http://www.rdecom.army.mil/STTC/baa.html<BR><BR>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding. The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission. Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitutes the Government's solicitation for this effort. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement. Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.   <BR>WHITE PAPER FORMAT:  White Papers shall not exceed 8 pages of computerized text at 12 pitch (excluding resumes) Contractor format is acceptable.  <BR>The white papers should be provided in hardcopy and CD electronic form no later than1600 EDT 18 June 2010.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your response to jquinn8@live.com and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your companys Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your companys responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companies base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  

Only Email responses will be accepted and must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.  If industry response is unsatisfactory, the TPRB reserves the right to proceed or cancel the project.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, product literature, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to jquinn8@live.com
 

D.	Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

4	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a product line that includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent of the products listed below.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure to do so will result in the vendors disqualification in this standardization effort.  Although not mandatory, it is acceptable to add additional products in this product line not listed below which are purchased by the facilities in this region as part of the regional incentive agreement request for quotation.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops 
	a. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of fluid/drug prescribed
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing drops
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
2.	The IV tubing is pliable and is memory free 
	a. Promotes an accurate and timely amount of medication and volume of fluid delivered 	during patient mobility/change in position.
	b. Evaluator will assess by bending and attempting to crimp the tubing
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
3.	IV tubing allows an effective priming speed, flow rate and stopcock function
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to prime tubing with fluid in an urgent 	care setting for patient care needs.
	b. Evaluator will assess by assembling and utilizing IV set (to include stop cock)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
4.	The buretrol (or volutrol) graduation allows visualization of an accurate volume level
	a. Promotes an accurate amount of medication and volume of fluid 	delivered to prevent 	fluid overload when indicated.
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing volume level
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
5.	Product item package identifies the type of IV tubing set 
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient 	care needs
	b. Evaluator will assess by visualizing product item packaging
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

<DESC>The announcement is a sources sought notice only. No solicitation exists at this time. The Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) within U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)/Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is seeking information regarding the capability and availability of qualified small business contractors to provide support for MARKAL. It is the intent of the Government to select one firm for a firm-fixed price contract. The contract will not to exceed eight months.
PROJECT INFORMATION:   MARKAL (short for MARKet ALlocation) is a computer-driven, dynamic optimization model of the U.S. energy sector with upwards of 42,000 equations of energy, environmental, and economic relationships. The Integrated Benefits Analysis fosters attainment of DOE's Strategic Plan through suggestions for optimal technological investments. 
The contractor will support the PA&E in creating results from the MARKAL model for Integrated Benefits Analysis, is to extend from July 2010 through January 2011 to cover 210 Strategic Runs, establish a MARKAL modeling capability within PA&E, and other associated activities.  As part of this required effort, the contractor will provide summarized and detailed model outputs, a comprehensive analytical report, and an operational up-to-date version of the model on PA&E computers.   
Modeled technologies must be nearly identical to each energy technology identified in the DOE budget, particularly in terms of cost, efficiency, possible deployment date and investment-related improvements in those parameters. Further, PA&E requires that the model assess those improvements and their effects on total energy system costs, energy security, carbon emissions, and other benefits. This capability allows PA&E to determine how best to achieve Administration, Secretarial, and Strategic Plan goals. Lastly, the model should include input and output programs to accommodate the vast quantity of data associated with approximately four budget scenarios (from zero to increased funding) combined with multiple policy scenarios (e.g., CAFE, Renewable Energy Standard, carbon cap, etc.). Given the urgency of the due dates associated with budget analysis and preparation, these model attributes must already be integrated into a version of MARKAL producing results consistent with EIA ?s Annual Energy Outlook 2010 and that encompasses all the relevant data from the various program offices working with PA&E on the initial FY2012 IBA.
The contractor providing MARKAL must be able to provide PA&E comprehensive model assumptions and specifications, a necessity for accurate interpretation and the invited results reviews. In addition, the contractor must be able to provide insights on the derivation and purpose of model nuances and already have an expert knowledge of DOE program data/goals and the budget process, also facilitating timely completion of due dates.  
The purpose of this sources sought notice is to identify small businesses that are capable of performing these services. Accordingly, this sources sought notice is for the sole purpose of identifying small business firms that meet the size standard and have provided a capability that fully complies with this notice's requirements. 
For purposes of this notice, a small business is defined by having annual revenues of less than $7,000,000 in average annual receipts in the firm's last three fiscal years. If a firm has revenues of greater than $7,000,000, the firm need not respond to this notice. 
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  Interested firm's must submit a capability statement that includes the firm's capabilities on no more than three pages and should include firms name, address, phone number, email and point of contact; capability to perform and demonstrated capability to provide support of MARKAL Model Runs and Sensitivity Analysis; and business size to include small business designation.
A statement that the firm's annual revenues are less than $7,000,000 in average annual receipts over the firm's last three fiscal years. Interested firms should submit capability statement to Arness Harris at arness.harris@hq.doe.gov by 2:00 p.m. local prevailing time on June 18, 2010. Capability statements are not proposals. Submission of a capability statement will not lead to the selection or award of a contract, as the purpose of this notice and capability statements is only to ascertain whether a small business set-aside is feasible for PA&E's requirement.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether there are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the potential acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code 541690, with a size standard of $7 milliion, should not submit a response to this notice.

Background:
The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health, seeks to obtain services related to the data population of a new, web-based application for cataloging all labels of dietary supplements marketed in the USA.  From August 2008 through July 2009, the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), in cooperation with the National Library of Medicine as specified in a memorandum of agreement, contracted with a private firm to design, develop, and demonstrate a comprehensive research database intended for public access via the internet to serve the needs of researchers and educators in accessing label data of the estimated 50,000 dietary supplement labels sold in the U.S.  The resulting researcher-oriented database, called the Dietary Supplements Label Database or DSLD, was successfully demonstrated to a panel of Federal Stakeholders in May 2009.  The DSLD was developed from the ground up with input from Federal stakeholders who participated on an ODS Federal Working Group during the 12-month contract.  The DSLD contains the advanced functionality required to meet the needs of its targeted end-users (researchers & educators) and will be deployed on the internet for public access and use.
The DSLD is intended to serve multiple research and educational needs. For example, it is frequently necessary in research studies to estimate total intakes of essential nutrients as well as other nutrients and bioactive constituents; this requires quantitative data on the vitamin, mineral, and other nutrient content of both foods and supplements. Without such information, the design of studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dietary supplement ingredients can be hampered. A resource documenting information about dietary supplement ingredients and products consumed by the U.S. population and subgroups might provide useful information for the public health community in developing effective consumer educational materials and programs. 


Sources Sought:
The Office of Dietary Supplements anticipates contracting with a vendor or vendors most capable of acquiring the data (text & images) contained on the label of each of the estimated 50,000 dietary supplements sold in the U.S. and organizing it in the format required by the DSLD database software.  The data is sought in a consistent and specified electronic format to facilitate the rapid input or interface to the ODS DSLD.  A detailed quality assurance plan would need to specify how data integrity will be maintained across such a large database.
Services required to fully meet the goals set out for this sources sought synopsis are to be primarily associated with NAICS code 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting.  Secondarily, services will be required that are associated with NAICS code 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, & Related Services.
Data Definitions, Business Rules, and Data Schema:
Data would be required to follow the defined DSLD Data Definitions, Business Rules, and Data Schema that have been established.  These rules may be seen online at:
http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/ods_data_description.pdf

Vendor Capabilities:
ODS seeks input from vendors demonstrating the following capabilities:
1)	Expertise in food & nutrition related research projects and nutrient analysis software applications.
2)	Experience with all aspects of data acquisition and population of a web-based database of similar complexity and scope (preferably related to food and nutrition related topics).
3)	Available project examples and client references from successful projects of similar scope (preferably related to food and nutrition related topics).
4)	  Familiarity with other, similar databases (preferably in the Government sector) dealing with the composition of food and dietary supplements.

Innovative approaches to satisfying the anticipated requirement would be encouraged if a solicitation were issued.
If your organization is a small business and has the capacity to perform these types of services, please provide the following information: 
1)	A detailed capability statement, not to exceed 5 pages
2)	Organization name, address, email address, web site address, and telephone number
3)	Size and type of ownership for the organization (i.e. small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) firm, etc.)
Business experiences, sizes, types, and socioeconomic designations shall be included with the capability statements.  Capability statements must be received by 2:00 pm (Local Time) on June 25, 2010.  Please send capability statements in .pdf format to Marci Goldman at the following email address:
GoldmanM@od.nih.gov

A maximum of five (5) pages for the capability statements are required.  Only the first five (5) pages of any submission will be reviewed!  The font size shall be a minimum of 10 point.  All margins shall be at least  inch.

The Afloat Training Group Pacific (ATGPAC) developed a knowledge and data enterprise solution called Training and Operational Readiness Information System (TORIS). TORIS enables Commander, Naval Surface Force's (CNSF) Ship Training (SHIPTRAIN) and Surface Warfare Enterprise (SWE) programs to collect, store and display readiness and performance data to provide cost-wise readiness. It was approved by the Department of the Navy Application and Database Management System (DADMS) in the fall of 2005 as an authoritative database.
As a suite of software applications, TORIS provides data collection, data display and data sharing for all surface force ships and all Afloat Training Groups (both Pacific and Atlantic areas of responsibility). Included in the TORIS suite are the following associated applications:
a. Training Figure of Merit (TFOM). TFOM provides a lens into the TORIS data base to provide units/ISICs a graphic representation of readiness across all warfare areas.b. Ships In Training (SIT). An internal tracking tool to track ship's certification status as they proceed through the unit level training cycle.c. Supply Management Certification (TORIS-Supply). Used to assess compliance with CNSFINST 5040.1 series and track certification.d. 3M Certification (TORIS-3M). Used to assess compliance with CNSFINST 4790.1 series Maintenance and Material Management certification.e. Scheduling and assignment of personnel - Master Scheduling Program (TORIS-MSP). Used to account for ATG manpower level of effort required to deliver training to surface ships.f. A human resource management (ATG Enterprise Personnel Program, AEPP). Integrates ATG personnel functions into TORIS-MSP to support efficient scheduling of personnel.g. TORIS-Afloat. Installed aboard every CNSF ship, is used by ship's force in their daily routine to train to requirements and collect data generated during training exercises.  Installed on NIAPS servers or stand-alone systems.  Leverages the NIAPS replication process for data transmission back to shore.
Additionally, TORIS feeds surface ship training readiness data to the Defense Readiness Reporting System-Navy (DRRS-N), which is the Navy's Mission Essential Tasks (METs)/capabilities-based readiness reporting system. 
There is a substantial requirement for contractor support to improve reliability and maintainability of TORIS to include installation of software on ships, troubleshooting software installed on ships, functional (business) analysis, software engineering and integration, configuration management/quality control, database management/system administration, user training, fleet hardware procurement and distribution, help desk management and documentation. Additionally, there is a significant amount of effort put into metric development and data analysis in direct support of the Surface Warfare Enterprise (SWE).

Other than small businesses may respond to this NOTICE however, preference will be given to the SB categories listed above. The government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of available contractors. The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements below to submit a Capability Statement. Sources are being sought for firms with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 541710. <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, anticipates a future procurement for Biological Services to provide data collection and analysis effort on the Impacts of Overwater Structures on Bull Trout in Lake Pend Oreille, Bonner County, Idaho.  <BR><BR>General Background and Primary Goals<BR>Bull Trout in Lake Pend Oreille have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1998.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permits overwater structures (e.g., recreational docks) on the lake, some by Regional General Permit (RGP).  The Corps seeks to better understand the potential impacts of these overwater structures and associated activities on bull trout to further evaluate the cumulative impacts of structures authorized by the RGP.  The primary goal of this work is to better determine the specific impacts of overwater structures (primarily recreational docks) on bull trout populations in Lake Pend Oreille.  A literature review of the potential impacts of overwater structures on Bull Trout identified gaps in the knowledge of juvenile bull trout migration behavior and habitat use after leaving natal streams and entering Lake Pend Oreille with particular focus on juvenile bull trout susceptibility to predators, the impacts of overwater structures on predator/prey interactions, and mitigation features of overwater structures.  In collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) has identified 4 specific tasks to provide information where knowledge gaps were identified.  The overall questions the Corps needs to answer are:<BR>1.	Do juvenile bull trout occupy littoral habitats?<BR>2.	Are littoral zone predators consuming juvenile bull trout?<BR>3.	How do overwater structures modify biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., fish community, water temperature etc.) relative to unmodified shoreline?<BR>4.	Are there specific mitigation criteria for overwater structures that can reduce impacts of overwater structures (e.g., predation) to bull trout?<BR><BR>The Contractor must have documented in-house experience and expertise successfully working in sheltered and near-shore waters, deep-water, as well as in open ocean locations. <BR><BR>Contractors also need to demonstrate experience of successfully and safely working in large bodies of water (e.g., Oceans, large lakes) to conduct technically and logistically difficult telemetry studies and fisheries surveys.  A description of boating licenses, boating safety courses, and other relevant training will be useful for evaluating this capability.  Also, published reports of successful studies on large lake systems where motorized boats were necessary to conduct the study will be useful.    <BR><BR>The Contractor must have in-house personnel with documented educational background and experience in utilizing computer techniques in the analysis and interpretation of the data identified above. <BR><BR>Contractors must have experience (through published reports, papers, and documents) that clearly show they have successfully used JSATS or possibly other very similar acoustic transmitters for a large-scale telemetry study in a large lake system or comparably difficult system to conduct telemetry studies.  <BR><BR>Contractor must demonstrate having experience with JSATS technology tagging fish 100 mm in length. Tagging fish in the 100-139 mm size range is critical to the success of this study.<BR><BR>Contractors must have experience in capturing species that occur at extremely low abundance in relatively large systems.  Simply collecting and working with species listed as threatened or endangered does not satisfy this capability requirement.       <BR><BR>This Sources Sought is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This Market Survey is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this Market Survey. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among either certified HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOB), certified 8(a) firms or proceed with competition among all small business firms. Interested contractors responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills, capability to fulfill the Governments requirements, and past performance in providing the type services specified above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 10 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements below. Submissions that do not meet all requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered. The Government respectfully requests information on or before 3:00 PM PST, Wednesday, June 16, 2010. Please provide capability statements to Mary M. Van Sickle, Contract Specialist, USACE, Walla Walla District, 201 North Third Avenue, Walla Walla, WA 99362-1876, or via email at mary.m.vansickle@usace.army.mil.<BR> <BR>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs has a requirement to purchase services to support the continued effort at the Center Innovative Visual Research (CIVR) in the development of a retinal prosthesis. The work shall be conducted primarily at manufacturers site. Any inquiries should be directed to the Robert OLeary Contracting Specialist at tel 774-826-3003 or email Robert.oleary@va.gov no later than 3:00 PM June 15, 2010 
The vendor shall conduct the following tasks in or at other facilities as required.
Objectives:
	To develop processes for stud bumping of individual CIVR retinal stimulator integrated circuits as necessary.
	To optimize the assembly process for circuit board that will be installed internally in the CIVR retinal prosthesis hermetic case, including flip-chip assembly of the CIVR ASIC onto the internal board.
	To implement on-site testing of internal circuit boards for the CIVR retinal prosthesis after they are assembled, to VA engineers specifications.
	To support the CIVR in engineering the entire assembly process for building the prosthesis, including recommending processes, vendors, and/or alternate approaches that would make the resulting assemblies more robust.
	To optimize the assembly of the external components of the prosthesis, including the CIVR-supplied secondary coils and the external flexible circuit, with a particular focus on robust attachment of these components to hermetic package feedthrough pins using gold-tin solder.
	To serialize the retinal prosthesis assemblies during the manufacturing process to CIVR specifications.
The tasks required to meet these objectives are the following. All testing will be conducted and documented in a manner appropriate for the future regulatory needs of the CIVR team.

Task 1.	  Stud Bumping. 
Employing proprietary know-how and equipment, Vendor shall on an as-needed basis optimize the stud bumping process for adding gold bumps to the contact pads of the CIVR ASIC, to facilitate future assembly.
Task 2.	  Internal Circuit Boards. 
Vendor shall optimize the processes for and assemble internal circuit boards for the CIVR prosthesis, including flip chip assembly and surface mounting of discrete components.
Task 3.	  On-Site Testing of Prosthesis Assemblies.  Vendor shall, when required by CIVR specifications, test sub-assemblies and complete retinal prosthesis assemblies to VA specifications prior to shipping any engineering units for inspection.  Any specialized test equipment or apparatus required for this purpose, apart from standard laboratory equipment such as multimeters and oscilloscopes, shall be provided or loaned by CIVR personnel to facilitate the required measurements.
Task 4.  Consulting for Assembly Process Robustness. 
Vendor shall provide input and recommendations to CIVR engineering personnel concerning best practices and sources for procuring essential components and fixturing so as to optimize the robustness of the resulting prosthesis assemblies.
Task 5.  External Components. 
Vendor shall optimize the process for assembling components that are external to the hermetic case of the CIVR prosthesis, including the secondary receiving coils and external flexible circuits, in consultation with VA engineers.  Special attention shall be paid to the robustness and solderability of interconnections between hermetic feedthrough pins and external flexible circuitry.
Task 6. Serialization. 
Vendor shall serialize each complete retinal prosthesis assembly using laser marking apparatus, according to specifications provided by the CIVR.  Documentation of subsequent builds or assembly operations shall reference these serial numbers on part or lot travelers for traceability purposes.

<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for an alternative analysis and the development of a functional prototype in support of an improved and integrated e-Discharge program.  
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
The e-Discharge  is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation. Currently, the VA's patient referral and discharge process creates a challenge for  VA Social Workers.  The current process, with as many as 42 steps, contributes to an increased length of stay for patients in VA sponsored facilities, which increases costs, patient safety risks, and patient and family dissatisfaction.  Furthermore, private hospitals are competing for community facility beds with a more streamlined and automated procedure for their referral and discharge program.  This allows the private hospitals to place patients more quickly and efficiently which decreases available beds for VA patients.
Requirements
VA intends to select the best solution to integrate   an "e-Discharge" application with the current VHA Enterprise Architecture.  e-Discharge, or IT Discharge, is a technological tool that contains software which automates, tracks, and monitors the discharge and referral process.  These commercial software packages are successfully used at many non-VA critical care facilities.  Software is available from various private companies to help critical care social workers and nurse case managers facilitate and expedite the discharge of patients. These tools promote the continuity of care for patients which increase patient safety.  VA is soliciting for an alternatives analysis of commercially available e-Discharge software that will integrate with the existing VHA Enterprise Architecture.  The selected option(s) will be contractor tested and vetted in the VHA Innovations Program Sandbox, a self-contained environment safe from live data and can be safely restored without loss of function to daily operating systems.  All findings, including the best method for the integration of the commercial software with applicable existing VHA operating systems, will be required at the conclusion of this contract.  
Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 10 pages.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information no later than June 11th, 2010 to Stacy A. Sullivan, Contract Officer.  Please provide submittals via email to stacy.sullivan@va.gov.  Submittals must be less than 5MB per email. 
1.	Past Experience - Provide the following information on a maximum of three similar projects completed within the last three years for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor.  
a.	The name, address, and value of each project
b.	The Prime Contract Type, Firm Fixed-Price, Cost Reimbursement or Time and Material
c.	The name, telephone and address of the owner of each project
d.	A description of each project, including difficulties and successes

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to increase the contract dollar value for the current Internet-Based Contractor Operated Parts Store (ICOPARS) contract number contract FA4803-06-D-0002. The current contract ceiling is $50M and current amount obligated is $46M. The contract will enter the fourth and final option year on 9 June 10. The average expenditure rate is $1.1M a month. This amount will fill the requirement for three and a half months. The reacquisition for this requirement is currently in the planning phase. The estimated time for reacquisition is between six to eight months. This is a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Requirements contract. The reacquisition will be competitive. The requirement to raise the ceiling by $10M, making the ceiling to $60M, is needed due to the burn rate and will allow adequate time to re-compete the requirement to ensure that the Government receives the best-value. This is neither a Request for Proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete the ceiling threshold increase requirement is solely within the Government's discretion. Information received by close of business 11 June 2010 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of market research when conducting the reacquisition of the new ICOPARS requirement.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International, Research Triangle Park, NC, for testing and evaluation of protective chemical/biological (CB) garments against an aerosol challenge.  This is a Test & Evaluation (T&E) effort in support of two separate projects for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)/Joint Science & Technology Officer (JSTO).  The primary objective of the first project, the Closures Effort is to improve aerosol protection by addressing leakage at the closures and interfaces of CB ensembles.  The primary objective of the second effort, the Chemical/Biological and Ground Soldier System Combined Technology Demonstration is to demonstrate the reduced thermal burden of current industry and government CB material technologies.  The overall purpose of this T&E effort is to determine the aerosol protection of the CB ensembles to be tested.  Two separate series of Aerosol System Tests (AST) are required for the two separate projects.  The only way to perform a complete assessment of how an ensemble protects against aerosols is through AST analysis, thus this test is a critical milestone for both projects.   RTI is the only company known to conduct AST as described by Test Operations Procedure (TOP 10-2-022):  Chemical Vapor and Aerosol System Level Testing of Chemical/Biological Protective Suites.  RTI was involved with developing this test back in the 1980s.  RTI is listed as an author of TOP 10-2-022 and is intimately familiar with the details of this test.  Since the inception of this test, RTI has conducted numerous AST of CB ensembles for the military and for the first responder community.   The estimated cost of this acquisition is $304,796.00.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 business days from the date of publication of this announcment.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 2 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380.    Any inquiries about this announcement may be addressed to the above address, Attention Michelle Miller or by email to:  submitted in writing  to Ms. Michelle Miller at Michelle.Marie.Miller@us.army.mil.  Inquiries shall be made no later than 12:00pm, 11 June 2010.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1788<br />Name: Steno Pad Holder, 6" x 9", Digitized Camouflage<br />Description: Durable, steno pad holders that can be custom printed. Each black vinyl cover is foam-padded to protect a 6"x9" 80-page steno notebook. Interior pocket provides storage for additional documents.</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1785<br />Name: Steno Pad Holder, Custom Printable, 6" x 9"<br />Description: Durable, steno pad holders that can be custom printed. Each black vinyl cover is foam-padded to protect a 6"x9" 80-page steno notebook. Interior pocket provides storage for additional documents.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service Office Support Center - Paper Products.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 18, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1770<br />Name: Tape, Pressure Sensitive, Waterproof, Digital Camouflage<br />Description: Waterproof Tape, Woven cloth backing, Digital Camouflage - 3" (72MM) W x 60yd L, 3"core<br /><br />NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1769<br />Name: Tape, Pressure Sensitive, Waterproof, Digital Camouflage<br />Description: Waterproof Tape, Woven cloth backing, Digital Camouflage - 2-1/2" (60MM) W x 60yd L, 3"core</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service Office Support Center - Paper Products.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 18, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to award a sole source contract with Sea-Bird Electronics for the purchase of twelve (12) SBE-39 Temperature Recorders for Crater Lake National Park.  Sea-Bird Electronics has been determined as the only firm uniquely qualified to supply this equipment under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 (only one responsible source will satisfy the agency's requirements). Only one thermister meets the above specifications needed for monitoring deepwater temperature at Crater Lake, SeaBird Electronics' SBE-39 Temperature Recorder.
The SBE39's inherent accuracy, resolution, and stability, combined with a rigorous 11-point temperature calibration, yield a true research-quality thermister.  Because the thermisters used at Crater Lake have already been replaced over the years with this specific model (SBE-39), the remaining thermisters need to be replaced with the same unit.  This allows the new thermisters to be seamlessly merged with the existing pool of instruments.  The new thermisters need to be directly compatible and directly comparable to the thermisters that have already been replaced.  The same model thermister is also needed so that a single software package can be used for programming, downloading, and calibrating all thermisters (software is unique to each manufacturer), to allow for the same mounting hardware on deepwater moorings, and to standardize replacement parts, maintenance schedules, battery replacement, and equipment manuals.   
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Responsible firms may submit a letter of interest and statement of capability/qualifications by the closing date of this notice which will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with THE CHARIOT GROUP INC, 3120 DENALI ST STE 1, ANCHORAGE, AK 99503-4000 to provide Video Conferencing equipment and installation at the Alaska Regional Office, Anchorage, AK 99501. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.


Justification for Non Competitive Acquisition
Background: The Alaska Regional Office has deployed Video Conference Equipment toalll major conference rooms within the Alaska Regional Office, 240 W. 5th Avenue, Anchorage, AK 99501. At this time conference rooms 420A & B have not been upgraded to the control system. The control system equipment must be compatible with existing equipment already installed in the Regional Office. 1.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) The Chariot Group in Anchorage, Alaska is the only available vendor that can provide the Polycom Video Conferencing Equipment as they are the only authorized reseller of this equipment in Anchorage, Alaska.  
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.The work that will be completed is the purchase and installation of Polycom HDX 7002 Video Conferencing Equipment in each room as well as a Sharp Aquos LC52D64U in each room with video conferencing controls that will fully integrate to the Alaska Regional Office's video conferencing system.

3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.). The Chariot group has installed all prior video conferencing equipment in the Alaska Regional Office and is the only authorized reseller of the needed Polycom video conferencing equipment needed that will fully integrate with the existing Alaska Regional Office video conferencing system.

4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Tests with Polycom video equipment has shown the units be easy to install, upgrade and maintain. A call was placed to Polycom and they stated that the Chariot Group was their Authorized Polycom Vendor for Anchorage, AK. The Chariot Group has been maintaining existing equipment and has be the source of all past Polycom Equipment.
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  It is very important that all of the Video Conference units be made by the same manufacturer. This will ensure compatibility and ease of configuration between all the deployed units. The ability to upgrade the units software on a regular basis is made easier when all of the equipment uses the same software. The ability to purchase a single service agreement to maintain all of the video units is far cheaper and easier than trying to purchase multiple maintenance agreements from several manufacturers and vendors. The Alaska Regions conference rooms are fully integrated with a single remote control system that is user friendly and easy to use. 
6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

RE: VA Northampton Boiler Building Project Questions

1.	Who services and maintains the existing fire alarm system and who is the manufacture of existing equipment? Response 1 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

2.	Please clarify if Division 23 or Division 26 is responsible for installing the direct buried conduits from the existing Boiler Building #15 to the new Boiler Building specifically the 4" conduit for future controls. This conduit run is over 600' in length. Response 2 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

3.	Drawing MEPS101 shows the proposed ductbank layout. There are three new manholes NMH-01, NMH-02, and NMH-03. The conduit between each of the manholes is identified by drawing key note 11. This note indicates (4) 5" conduit ductbank. Is it safe to assume that we are responsible for installing 4-5" conduits in these duct banks? Response 3 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

4.	Drawing MEPS101 shows (4) 5" conduits ending at NMH-01. Do these conduits end here or is additional work required? The same drawing shows (4) 5" conduits ductbank leaving NMH-03 and stopping at existing MH left of the new equipment pads which is identified with note 20. Is this for future work or is this where the 15 KV originates? Response 4 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

5.	Where is EMH-3 located as shown on drawing E201? Response 5 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

6.	Drawing E201, medium voltage feeder schedule 15 KV indicates feeder P1 * P2 as 3-500 KCMIL + 1 4/0 g. The conduit size is not shown. Is it safe to assume that 2-5" will be for P1 feeder with one being active and the other being a spare? The same question applies to P2 feeder. Response 6 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

7.	Drawing E201 pad mounted transformer data table has TR20 listed as a new 15 KV primary 3 phase 3 wire 480/277 vac 3 phase 4 wire secondary serving the new boiler plant from SW12and the KVA rating is 1500. On drawing E202 note 9 has this same transformer listed at 1000 KVA. What is the correct kva rating?  Response 7 - On Drawing #E202, Electrical Secondary service and Fire Alarm Riser Diagrams; CHANGE Note 9 to read 1500 kVA transformer.

8.	Drawing E202 3 phase feeder size schedule has the listed feeders but the riser diagram does not have corresponding markings. Is it possible to identify each feeder? Response 8 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

9.	For estimating purposes, is it safe to assume there will be three conduits from building #15 to the new boiler building and that these conduits will be as follow: 1-2" 3#1, 1#3 for CP-1, 1-2" 3#1, 1#3 for FOP-2 and 1-4" with a pull string for future control wiring? Response 9 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

10.	If the answer to question 9 is correct, would manholes or handholes be required to be installed in this ductbank since the conduit run is over 600'? If so what size manholes / handoles? Response 10 - On Drawing 4MEPS101, Mechanical Electrical Plumbing New Work Site Plan; ADD (3)
30"x48" handholes for (2) 2 1/2" conduits. Refer to detail 3/E501 for additional information, Space handholes equally along conduit run. On Drawing #MEPS101, Mechanical Electrical Plumbing New Work Site Plan; ADD (3) 30"x48" handholes for (1) 4" conduit. Refer to detail 3/E501 for additional information. Space .handholes equally along conduit run.

11.	Is a grounding conductor required to be installed in the ductbank with the direct buried conduits? What size is recommended? Response 11 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

12.	What is the purpose for replacing the handhole currently serving the existing building schedule for demolition? What size handhole is required? Response 12 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

13.	Drawing MEPS101 indicates by note 1 at the location of the existing tunnel and the new boiler building that we are to install a 2" for telephone and data. Does this conduit route inside the tunnel or does it stop at the penetration? Who installs the telephone and data cable and from where? Response 13 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

14.	Drawing EP101 note P11 and P6 both call for 2 " conduits to the existing boiler building. Drawing E401 shows these as 2". Which conduit size shall be used? Response 14 - Provide 2 1/4" conduits for "FOP-2 and "CP-1" circuits.

15.	What do the circled numbers represent on the riser diagram E202 leaving MCC-1? The numbers are 1-11. Response 15 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

16.	The ATS-3 is described as a 400 amp 4 poles 480/277 on drawing E202 note 4. However it is feeding MCC-1. MCC-1 schedule on drawing E601 has this equipment as three phase 3 wire. Is the ATS-3 to be a three phase three wire as well or are we installing a neutral to the MCC-1? Response 16 - Drawing #E601, Electrical Schedules; CHANGE motor control Center "MCC-I" Schedule to read 400A, 480/277VAC, MLO, 3-phase, 4-Wire. Provide neutral buss in MCC-1 to accommodate the neutral conductor from the ATS.

17.	Drawing EP101 shows the ATS-1 in the main electrical room but drawing E202 riser diagram shows ATS-1 in the life safety electrical room. Which is correct? Response 17 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

18.	ATS 3 is shown in the life safety room on drawing EP101 and in the main electrical room on E202. Which is correct? Response 18 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

19.	I noticed on drawing MP101, the mechanical condensate pit part plan, note 47 and 48 represent two VFD's for the CPT-1 & the CPT-2. However these two VFD's are built into the MCC-1 as shown on drawing E202. Are these being supplied by the electrical subcontractor as part of the MCC or are they stand alone and being provided by the mechanical contractor? Response 19 - On Drawing #E601, Electrical Schedules; ELIMINATE (2) VFD's in motor control Center "MCC-1" Schedule. Provide circuit breaker bucket only. On Drawing #E202, Electrical Secondary service and Fire Alarm Riser Diagrams; ELIMINATE (2) VFD's on Main Service Riser for pumps "CPT-1" and "CPT-2". Provide circuit breaker only buckets in the MCC.

20.	I don't see any light fixtures in the control room. Please see EL101 room 107. Response 20 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

The reason justifying other than full and open competition is that ELCAN Optical Technologies produces the only system capable of meeting the requirement with the specific proprietary software, hardware, and interfaces required.  This action is based on 10 of U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) and pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302.1(B)(1)(i), in that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  ELCAN Optical Technologies is the original equipment manufacturer and the vendor of the AN/PAS-28 MRTB.  The MRTB APS will allow the Government to organically troubleshoot, diagnose, repair, and maintain the AN/PAS-28 MRTB systems at the Field Level, by fielding the capability to select Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA) geographically located in support of Marine Forces (MARFORs), both CONUS and OCONUS, which best meets the Government's needs and current mission requirements.  It is essential that the Government uses the original equipment manufacturer to purchase the systems and incorporate the variant needed.  ELCAN Optical Technologies has the proprietary rights to the AN/PAS-28 MRTB and can incorporate the required software and interfaces to the MRTB APS.  ELCAN Optical Technologies is the only source that can meet the Government's requirement in quality and time.  This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations.

<DESC><p>The 902d Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB has a Sole-Source requirement to purchase items as described in the Description of Supplies. This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>
<p>This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a request for quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 561920; size standard $7.0M.</p>
<p>IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES</p>
<p>CLIN 0001:<br />Description: Exhibit booth space (10' X 10')<br />Qty: Twenty-four (24)</p>
<p>B. Period of Performance: 13 Sep 2010 through 15 Sep 2010</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic has been selected to host this year's Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award (CSTEA) participants. The CSTEA has been schedule for 13-15 September 2010. Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception. As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-five competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements. The CSTEA program is sponsored by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and administered by the Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) to recognize outstanding team performances and share best practices within the Air Force, Chief of Staff Excellence Award Program, requires each team be provided a 10 X 10 foot area, funded by AFMA for their display booth. As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-four competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements. In accordance with Award Review Team report, the 2010 CSTEA will be held at the Air Force Associations' Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition. As a co-attended event, it is imperative that all exhibits booths and associated deliverables identically match in minimum terms such as color, material, size and function. For the purpose of uniformity, no one booth "can stand out" from all other booths. A portion of the exhibit booths (approximately 24 of the 543) have been funded by the AFA and already leased through AFAVBA. As such, the AFA portion of the Expo must match the existing requirements. The AFAVBA is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists. Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment. The effectiveness, spirit, and morale boost achieved by AFMA's CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program. Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomac vicinity during the CSTEA schedule time frame.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>AATD anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, Fiber Optic Harness for Military Helicopter Applications Program.  The program will design, fabricate, test and evaluate optical harnesses for use in rotorcraft applications.  This effort will satisfy the Armys requirement for a Technology Risk Reduction Program that decreases weight, saves space and improves reliability on the platform.<BR><BR>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, Fiber Optic Harness for Military Helicopter Applications Program. The Armys overarching requirement is to replace an existing electrical harness on a current Army Aviation rotorcraft.  The replacement of existing wiring harnesses and cable bundles without modification to line replaceable units (LRUs) or aircraft systems will enable an increase in bandwidth, increased immunity to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and potential weight and space savings.  The ability of this technology to function properly in a relevant operational environment will be fully tested.  This system could be applicable to components on several military aircraft.  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee task orders on a sole source basis to Defense Photonics Group, Inc, (DPG) who is deemed to be the only responsible source fully capable of meeting this requirement.  The acquisition builds upon previously completed contracted research and development as well as independent research and development conducted by DPG as the patent holder of Patent No. US 7,362,936 B2 Optical Harness Assembly and Method.  On the basis of the available data, AATD deems that only DPG is capable of providing the fiber optic cables and connectors such that the Army can conduct testing within the required timeframe. AATD envisions functional compliance testing on optical cable harnesses for Army use incorporating the unique technology of the Optical Harness Assembly and Method.  The maximum value of the contract will be $10 million.  The contract minimum value of $450,000 will be met with award of the first task order. This requirement is to conduct a requirements analysis and trade study of critical components of a fiber optic harness and develop an in-line housing that can be used in place of a standard connector as well as a flexible I/O module that can be used with multiple signal types. This requirement is also to procure and enhance circuit design and finite element model analysis tools for the designing of fiber optic harnesses to include circuit design libraries and databases for future design implementations and to develop design documentation packages as well as program management and quality management documentation to support the development of a fiber optic harness.  Accordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified Defense Photonics Group, Inc as the only source for Fiber Optic Harness and Assembly cables and connectors and related services. <BR><BR>The Government deems that substantial duplication of cost incurred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source with the required technical maturity equivalent to that of DPGs fiber optic harness and assembly system exists to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe required.  <BR><BR>Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Defense Photonics Group, Inc., 111 Corporate Blvd, Ste A, South Plainfield, NJ  07080.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and Defense Photonics Group, Inc, consistent with alpha contracting procedures.   The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is five (5) years.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413, Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing and the size standard is 1000 employees.  <BR><BR>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by this agency.  Proposals/other information submitted in response to this notice are due no later than July 20, 2010, 1:00 p.m. EST.  Proposals shall be submitted to the AATD, ATTN: CCAM-RDT (Velvet Taylor), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Electronic proposal submission is authorized via AMRDEC Safe Access File Exchange (SAFE) at https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE.   The Contract Specialist is Ms. Velvet Taylor, telephone 757-878-2306.

The government may perform an on-site evaluation of the hotel to confirm the contents of the written proposal and to assess the cleanliness, condition, security and overall adequacy of the proposed hotel.  If the government performs an on-site evaluation, findings from the on-site evaluation will be considered in the overall evaluation of Mission Capability.<BR>1.  Mission Capability.  Under Mission Capability the following elements will be evaluated:  Room Availability/Sanitation/Cleanliness, Security, Special Features / Amenities, and Facility Location.  These elements will be evaluated together for assessment of the overall Mission Capability factor.  The Mission Capability factor will receive one of the following adjectival ratings:<BR><BR>	GOOD  -  Proposal (written and on-site evaluation considered) demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements and proposes an approach that somewhat exceeds minimum requirements.  Has some exceptional strengths, with no major weaknesses.  Has some weaknesses that should not impact successful contract performance with normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring.  Good probability of success with low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>	ACCEPTABLE  - Proposal (written and on-site evaluation considered) demonstrates a general understanding of the requirements and an approach that meets minimum requirements.  Proposal presents an acceptable solution, but has few strengths.  Identified weaknesses may impact successful contract performance without special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring to minimize difficulties.  Fair probability of success with moderate degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>	MARGINAL  -  Proposal (written and on-site evaluation considered) demonstrates a shallow understanding of the requirements and an approach that satifies most but not all of the Government's requirements, or in some instances, fails to provide sufficient detail to demonstrate the feasability of the proposed approach.  Proposal has few strengths and major weaknesses that can cause some disruption of schedule or degradation of performance.  Weaknesses can be corrected through discussions, if discussions are conducted by the Contracting Officer.  Offers an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.  Proposal may not be considered for award unless weaknesses are corrected through discussions, if discussions are conducted.<BR>	UNACCEPTABLE -  Proposal (written and on-site evaluation considered) failed to meet the minimum PWS requirements necessary for acceptable performance.  The overall proposal contains numerous weaknesses that cannot be corrected through discussions, without a major rewrite of the proposal.  Offers an overall high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.  Proposal will not be considered for award.<BR>NOTE:  Security will be a key factor in the selection consideration process. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in the area of security will NOT be eligible for award.  <BR>	2.  Past Performance. Under Past Performance the following elements will be evaluated:  Quality of rooms/services, timeliness, and customer relations. These elements will be evaluated together for assessment of the overall Past performance Risk factor.  Past Performance will be evaluated in terms of a performance risk assessment.  The following performance risk ratings will be used for the Past Performance Evaluation factor:<BR>	Low Risk - Based on the offeror's performance record and experience, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR>	Moderate Risk - Based on the offeror's performance record and experience, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR>	High Risk - Based on the offeror's performance record and experience, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR>	Unknown  Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.  <BR>NOTE:  A proposal receiving a high risk rating will NOT be eligible for award.     <BR>	3.  Price.  Price will not be rated.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.404-1.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  As part of price evaluation, the the government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price.  Thus, the offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the prices for CLIN 0001, CLIN 1001, CLIN 1002, CLIN 1003, CLIN 1004, and CLIN 1005.  Where the selection official finds the proposals as being essentially equal with respect to technical factors, price may become the determining factor in selecting the best value offer and making the award. <BR>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT. The Government anticipates to award an Indefinite Quantity contract to multiple offerors who present the best value to the Government.<BR><BR> (M.)  The following provisions apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by full text: FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items, and FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions IBR.

Both CABs and Visitor Passes are issued at the Pass and Registration Center (PRC) located at the south entrance to the USAFA.<br />(2) Added: All references to contractor in this clause include the prime contractor and all subcontractors.<br />(3) Added: Vehicle Usage<br />(i) Contractor vehicles delivering food or water onto the installation are subject to inspection at entry control points. Vehicles making food and water deliveries on the installation will secure their vehicles when not attended to prevent unauthorized access and potential tampering. Vehicles making deliveries off the installation prior to arriving at the USAFA will ensure delivery vehicles remain locked when not attended. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination of vehicle access privileges. <br />(ii) Contractors filling water trucks on the installation are only authorized to fill trucks from the non-potable hydrant outside Bldg 8034 and non-potable reservoir #3. The approved potable location is from the hydrant south of Bldg 8124, Snow Barn. Exceptions to these locations can be approved by 10 CES after coordination with 10 SFS. Any location where contractors are filling water trucks will have a back-flow preventor installed.<br />(4) Added: Security Requirements. The contractor shall adhere to the installation security requirements as provided for in AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, USAFA supplement Chapter 2,Para 2.3 and 2.4; Chapter 7, Para 7.3; and Chapter 8) AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards (Paragraphs 2.22, Atch 3), DoDI 2000.16, Department of Defense Antiterrorism Standards, Paragraphs E3.18 and E3.25). <br />(i) Antiterrorism (AT). During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs), entry requirements to the installation may change with little to no notice. During FPCON Charlie, contractors without a "C" on their CAB may be denied access. Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorism measure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy. Government provided OPSEC training is offered at no charge to the contractor. The contractor shall notify the applicable Unit OPSEC representative of the using activity receiving the contracted support, within one business day upon the discovery of any OPSEC violations<br />(iii) Communications Security (COMSEC): The contractor shall comply with Government COMSEC requirements as contained in AFI 33-201V2, Communications Security, user requirements and USAFA COMSEC Manager guidance/directives. <br />(5) Added: Prior to contractor employees providing services on the installation under this contract, the contractor shall validate that all contractor employees performing services on the installation are United States citizen or hold a valid resident alien status providing proof of alien registration with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service.<br />(i) Background Checks. Prior to contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the contractor shall agree that USAFA Security Forces may conduct a criminal history check, as applicable, on any or all employees performing on this contract. Criminal history checks may include accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to, any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses. If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract. The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC. The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.<br />(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned. The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests quotations and constitutes the only solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the Government-Wide Point of Entry, www.fedbizopps.gov. Request for Quotation Number <br /><strong>ED-FSA-10-R-0523</strong> three year test studies shall be referenced on any quotation.<br />This solicitation is being issued under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). All future information about this acquisition including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.<br />The Department of Education, Federal Student Aid, is seeking qualified psychometricians to determine whether analyses of tests performed by test publishers meet basic standards. The analyses to be reviewed are of tests used to determine federal student aid eligibility for a student who does not have a high school diploma or its equivalent. By law, such a student may still be eligible for Federal student aid, if the student can demonstrate the "ability to benefit" (ATB) from the training or education offered by a postsecondary institution. The Secretary of Education periodically approves ATB tests as submitted by private test publishers. The test publishers are subsequently required to conduct a study three years after the approval date (and for each subsequent three year period) to analyze the test scores of students who take the ATB tests in order to qualify for Title IV, HEA program benefits (student financial aid). The analysis is to determine whether the test scores produce any irregular patterns that raise an inference that tests were not being properly administered. Copies of these three year test studies are required to be sent to the Secretary of Education for review.<br />The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid will select an expert(s) in the field of education testing and assessment, who possesses the appropriate advanced degrees and experience in test development or psychometric research to determine whether the three year test studies meet the requirements under 34 CFR 668.150(b)(8) and the American Psychological Association and the National Council on Measurement in Education standards for testing. Federal Student Aid needs the services of a psychometrician(s) to review these three year test studies to ensure that the test studies meet the standards delineated in the regulations -34 CFR 668, Subpart J. The Statement of Work at the end of this notice has further information on the standards.<br />No travel will be required for this RFQ. The psychometrician(s) will review each three- year test study separately. If there is more than one psychometrician, they will confer (via telephone, e-mail, etc.) and submit a joint list of comments and questions to the Department of Education, Federal Student Aid representative via e-mail. The government representative will forward the list to the test publisher for their consideration and comments, and then return the publisher's response back to the psychometrician(s) to work through any remaining issues. Once all issues are resolved, the final deliverable is a report from the psychometrician(s) indicating their recommendation for either approval or disapproval of the three year test study. If disapproved, the psychometrician(s) will provide a detailed explanation for recommending denial along with the specific steps that the publisher needs to take in order to obtain approval.<br />Federal Student Aid intends to issue one Purchase Order for the above services to the responsible vendor whose quote conforms to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government. <br />The evaluation will be based on information provided by the vendor in the quote, which shall include a technical volume, a price volume and past performance information. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the quotation but may do so at its discretion.<br />Offerors shall submit two references for evaluation of past performance of same or similar services, which have been successfully completed by the quoter within the past two (2) years.<br />Please review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:<br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Sept 2006);<br />FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical capability of the item to meet the Government requirement, 2. Price, and 3. Past Performance. <br />All evaluation factors are of equal importance. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)
<p>FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification - Commercial Items (Nov 2006) - All offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote;<br />FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb 2007);<br />FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (Nov 2006) <br />Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at http://www.arnet.gov. All quotes from responsible sources will be considered.<br />Quotes will only be accepted electronically and are to be submitted to Linwood.Cherry@ed.gov and/or Amanda.Pafford@ed.gov. No other method of submission will be accepted. The deadline for quotes is June 15, 2010 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Quotes shall include pricing per test review.<br />Statement of Work<br />Background: <br />Federal Student Aid (FSA) is the office in the United States Department of Education that deals with funding post-secondary education through federal grant, work-study and loan programs for students attending eligible and participating institutions of higher education. General student eligibility requires, among other conditions, that students have a high school diploma or its equivalent in order to participate in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), funding programs. However, the law and regulations establish an ability-to-benefit (ATB) option to allow students who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent and who did not complete secondary school in a home-school setting to show that they have the "ability to benefit" from the training or education offered by a post-secondary institution and as such can therefore qualify for federal grant or loan assistance.<br />ATB tests are approved by the Department of Education based on criteria established in the regulations. The ATB tests are produced by test publishers and provided to independent test administrators or assessment center to be given to eligible students. Test publishers are required to review test scores to look for patterns of irregularity that could indicate that tests are not being properly administered.<br />FSA is seeking the services of a qualified psychometrician(s) to determine whether the three year test score analyses submitted by the test publishers produce a pattern of irregularity that raises an inference that the ATB tests were not being administered properly. ATB test publishers are required by regulation to produce this analysis every three years following the Secretary's approval of any ATB test.<br />FSA seeks experts in the field of education testing and assessment, who possess the appropriate advanced degrees and experience in psychometric research to confirm the validity of the anomaly analysis and provide the Secretary with their suggested corrective actions for publishers whose three year test anomaly submissions do not sufficiently determine whether there is a pattern of irregularity.<br />Objectives/Tasks:<br />A. Review - The selected vendor will review up to seven (7) three-year anomaly analysis reports submitted by the test publishers to ensure that they meet the requirements of the agreement between FSA and the test publishers as identified below.<br />In conducting and reporting the analysis, the test publisher will:<br />1. Collect sufficient data from test administrators and schools to evaluate and explain the potential reasons for test score anomalies;<br />2. Describe in detail the standards for determining a regular distribution of test scores;<br />3. Describe the factors used to identify irregular test score patterns, and<br />4. Identify schools or test centers that have irregular test score patterns and rank the severity of the irregularities at those test sites.<br />B. Assessment/Verification - The selected vendor, upon review of the anomaly analysis report, will determine the accuracy and completeness of the information provided based on the requirements above and using industry standards, guidelines and practices, such as the Standards of Educational and Psychological Testing produced by the American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association and National Council on Measurement in Education.</p>
<p>Requirements/Deliverables</p>
<p>1. A copy of each three-year anomaly analysis will be mailed to the vendor and must be returned to FSA with the final report. The due date for the deliverable will be determined at Purchase Order award. All inquiries from the test publishers regarding the data or information presented in the analysis must be submitted to FSA in writing with reference to the Point of Contact (POC) for each of the test publishers. A dated written report for each three-year anomaly analysis reviewed indicating whether the analysis met or did not meet the requirements stated in sub-paragraph "A" above.</p>
<p>2. The report must confirm that the methodology used by the test publisher was accurate and indicate whether it did or did not meet industry standards. The report must identify missing or incomplete elements or flaws in the methodology of the analysis used by the test publishers. If the submission from the test publisher does not meet industry standards, the report must detail the reasons and identify specific steps that the publisher needs to take to bring the analysis into compliance and be eligible for approval. Finally, the report must include recommendations regarding the methodology or analysis employed.</p>

<CONTACT>Lisa Ko, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-5095, Email Lisa.Ko@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to sole source by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA intends to award a purchase order to University of Louisiana at Lafayette: New Iberia Research Center (NIRC), in the amount of $50,200.00. The Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Division of Viral Products requires unique access to chimpanzees for research purposes with deliverables in the form of biological samples and data analysis for their project titled "Studying T-Cell Markers in HCV Re-Challenged Chimpanzees and Association with Clearance." The project requires the use of chimpanzees that have previously recovered from a genotype 1a hepatitis C virus infection and the continuation of studies on one particular animal from an initial vaccine study that was conducted in 2008, specifically animal #91A025. Animal #91A025 recovered from the HCV infection after vaccination and we wish to study further the specific immune responses in this animal if it is again exposed to HCV. <br /><br />Hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be administered i/v to 3 animals that have previously cleared an HCV infection; one of these animals should be animal #91A025. The animals will be maintained and housed by the contractor throughout the study time; all procedures will be performed by contractor staff. The animals will be screened prior to inoculation in an initial health check and blood will be tested in routine chemistry assays by the contractor. The chimpanzees will be isolated from other animals not on study. Blood (weekly) and liver biopsies (every other week) will be obtained and shipped to the FDA for subsequent analysis. Pre challenge samples will be taken for 2 weeks prior to rechallenge and the animal will be followed for 10 weeks post rechallenge. The total study time will be 13 weeks. During this time there will be 13 bleeds and 7 liver biopsies for each animal. A sample of plasma will be retained by the contractor and tested for alanine amino transferase. The results of these tests will be sent to the FDA. The contractor will supply 39 blood samples and 21 liver biopsies from 3 chimpanzees following infection with hepatitis C virus. Animal #91A025 can only be obtained from the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) and is proprietary to NIRC. The study must be conducted at the same facility for all 3 animals for the results to remain consistent. The vendor is located at P.O. 13610, New Iberia, LA, 70562-3610.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 the Government is contemplating an award on a sole source basis for the following reasons:<br /><br />a. The Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Division of Viral Products requires unique access to chimpanzees for research purposes with deliverables in the form of biological samples and data analysis and the continuation of studies on one particular animal, #91A025 which can only be obtained from the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) and is proprietary to NIRC.<br /><br />b. There is a current legitimate need for this study and the use of chimpanzees that have previously recovered from a genotype 1a hepatitis C virus infection, one of which is specifically animal #91A025.<br /><br />c. The study must be conducted at the same facility for all 3 animals to result in consistent and valid findings.<br /><br />The NAICS code is 62511. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes, no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A solicitation will be issued to University of Louisiana at Lafayette: New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) no less than 15 days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines to conduct a competitive procurement. All written inquiries must be received via email no later than Wednesday, June 16, 2010 at 2PM ET to the attention of Contract Specialist, Lisa Ko at lisa.ko@fda.hhs.gov. No fax or traditional mail submissions shall be accepted.<br />

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.  

BACKGROUND
The required equipment shall be utilized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology/Synchrotron Methods Group.  The mission of the Synchrotron Methods 
Group is to develop and implement instrumentation related to synchrotron measurement.  

The vertically collimating mirror (VCM) is an essential optical element of the NIST spectroscopy/diffraction beamline.  The spectroscopy/diffraction beamline is being developed for a three-pole wiggler (3PW) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)-II.  The VCM will use the NSLS-II three-pole wiggler (3PW) as its source and will be upstream of an existing NIST-owned double crystal monochromator (DCM).  This is a beamline for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction.

The standard mode of operation for the beamline will be with Si(311) crystals in the DCM and an operating range of 4.5 keV to 40 keV.  NIST may consider windowless, tender-energy operations down to 2.1 keV in the future.  This should be considered when developing the design.  

Reference documentation to NSLS-II beam properties, including the properties of the 3PW, can be found at http://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/project/source_properties.asp. Other information related to NSLS-II or the 3PW source can be obtained from the NSLS-II project.

The VCM is intended to condition the divergent, broad-band radiation produced by a NSLS-II 3PW for optimal performance for both spectroscopy and diffraction.  

The VCM must be capable of collimating throughout the energy range, however the ability to adjust the reflecting angle and thus the acceptance aperture at lower energies in order to maximize throughput is required.  

Fixed exit of the beam from VCM or from the first optical enclosure is not a requirement of the mirror system.  This will  require a mirror of sufficient width to support two coatings.

It is noted that the NSLS-II is currently under construction and is anticipated to be completed not later than December 2012, however, this timeline is subject to change.  The VCM will be delivered and installed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Building 725, Upton, NY, however, will ultimately be moved to the NSLS-II site upon completion of construction.

<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services:</p>
<p>Line Item 1: SCIENTIFIC SCOPING SURVEY OF SEA TURTLES IN SOLOMON ISLANDS</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Contract Scope and Background</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is jointly responsible for the management, protection and recovery of marine turtle populations as mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA). There are five ESA listed sea turtle species. Of these, the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is endangered throughout its global range with populations facing high probability of extinction due to environmental and demographic stochasticity as a result of fisheries interactions, direct harvest (of turtles and eggs/nests), predation, and habitat degradation (Eckert 1996; Spotila et al. 1996; Dutton et al. 2007; Bellagio II proceedings 2007). Based on published estimates of nesting female abundance, leatherback populations are declining at all major Pacific basin nesting beaches (Spotila et al., 1996; NMF and USFWS, 1998c; Dutton et al., 2007).</p>
<p>As a result, NMFS Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO) is interested in gaining greater understanding of locally-based threats and impacts, and investigating options for expanding conservation and recovery efforts for population occurring in the western Pacific region. Currently, the western Pacific harbors some of the last remaining nesting aggregations of significant size occurring in Papua Indonesia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands and Vanuatu with approximately 2700-4500 breeding females occurring in this metapopulation (Dutton et al. 2007). Therefore long-term monitoring and protect at key index sites in these four countries is crucial for population recovery and for understanding demographics, status, and trends for the development of appropriate management policies.</p>
<p>To date, NMFS is actively invested in conservation and research programs occurring in Papua Indonesia, PNG and Vanuatu. Although some research (genetic, satellite telemetry and aerial surveys) has occurred in the Solomon Islands, comparatively little conservation investment has been made by NMFS in this country. Based on the findings of a working group convened in 2005 by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (Kinan 2005; Dutton et al. 2007) and the second Bellagio workshop convened in Malaysia (Bellagio II proceedings 2007), the Solomon Islands are now understood to be more important than previously thought with the size of the nesting population thought to be on the order of hundreds, rather than tens of females (Dutton et al. 2007).</p>
<p>There are opportunities to immediately enact conservation measures through community-based initiatives on the nesting beaches to dramatically increase hatchling production and reduce adult mortality before these populations collapse (Hitipeuw et al. 2007; Pilcher 2009). This is a priority that has been highlighted in two action plans for leatherbacks in the Pacific (Worldfish Center 2004 and Bellagio II proceedings 2007), as well as in other regional agreements such as the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia Memorandum of Understanding, and the Tri-National Agreement signed in September 2006 between Indonesia, PNG, and Solomon Islands to coordinate conservation of leatherbacks.</p>
<p>Contract Objectives<br />The objective of this contract is to secure a qualified contractor with expertise in the implementation of leatherback research and conservation projects to travel to the Solomon Islands to meet with local communities or existing projects to: 1) assess and understand current activities (research and/or conservation) of existing projects; 2) gain an understanding if NMFS would be welcomed or invited to collaborate with existing projects to support or bolster conservation benefits; and 3) if existing projects do not currently exist, assess the potential of establishing community-based conservation activities or project. Specifically, contractor should be able to:</p>
<p>&bull; In a culturally appropriate and respectful manner, assess any research or conservation methodology being utilized by any existing projects; <br />&bull; In a culturally appropriate and respectful manner, assess any locally-based population threats or impacts, including the community-based socio-economic relevance of these threats; <br />&bull; Of any existing projects, assess if the project or community is interested in greater coordination or collaboration (either via financial or technical capacity) with NMFS; <br />&bull; Assess if any interested communities or projects have effective project management oversight capacity, including fiscal accountability, if NMFS were to engage with such projects; and <br />&bull; Assess the potential for success for either project implementation or collaboration by NMFS, including relative project costs or specific technical needs to progress conservation benefits to the species within the relevant community-based socio-economic structure.</p>
<p>Performance-based Contractor Tasks and Duties<br />Contractor duties will include: <br />&bull; Establish contact with any existing projects or community leaders in the Solomon Islands prior to embarking on a site visit.<br />&bull; Coordinate travel logistics for a site visit to the Solomon Islands to visit with at least four communities including, but not necessary limited to: Sasakolo and Litogarhira of Isabel Island, and Rendova and Tetepare in the Western Province. <br />&bull; Coordinate the site visit ideally during peak nesting period: November 2010 to March 2011. <br />&bull; Write a trip/contract report detailing the activities, objectives and recommendations based on the site visit.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements<br />Applicant should have proven experience working with communities in the Western Pacific Region, and the ability to work well independently and cooperatively with a range of individuals and agencies representing different cultures and perspectives. Ideal candidate should have proven program development and implementation expertise, specifically of leatherback turtle research and conservation programs. Candidate should have proven expertise in sea turtle biology, their threats, and management issues, and proven ability to implement and oversee marine turtle monitoring and research activities/programs. The contractor will provide own computer and computer services. Contract will include the costs of travel to the Solomon Islands and within country transportation, including per diem and accommodations. Contractor should provide an estimate of expected travel costs in their proposal.</p>
<p>Deliverables <br />Costs payable upon receipt of two invoices:</p>
<p>1) A summary report of proposed travel and site visit logistics submitted to NMFS Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO) (October 2010)</p>
<p>2) Contract final report submitted to PIRO detailing the activities, achievements and objectives of the site visit to the Solomon Islands. Report should include expert recommendations, personal and professional observations, photos, community or projects contacts, and recommendations as outlined in the objectives of this contract to NMFS PIRO upon conclusion of the site visit. Report should include advice on future conservation and management activities necessary to progress recovery of leatherback turtles occurring in the Solomon Islands. (March 2011)</p>
<p>Period of Performance <br />The period of performance for this project is 6 months, from approximately October 1, 2010 through March 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property and Security<br />There will be no government furnished property associated with this contract. Contractor will provide own computer and computer services.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK 
1.	Scope. Acquisition and installation of two large screen monitors into the Marine Corps Air Station, New River Memorial Chapel, that can both be connected by USB or Coax cable to a single PC or other media outputs.  The screens need to be large enough to be easily seen and words read from the back pews. 
1.1	Background. The New River Air Station Memorial Chapel is used by every Squadron on station for training large groups, and we need to meet the multi-media needs.  The Chapel also wants to provide contemporary worship, to include words to songs, video, and other multi-media projects to enhance the worship experience.
2.	Tasks.  Install, wire, and set-up two large screen monitors for use as multi-media in the MCAS NR Memorial Chapel.
2.1	General Requirements.  The monitors need to be able to be hooked up by USB to our laptop, so we can run programs, slide, and video on the monitors.  We need both monitors to show the same thing at the same time, so we need the ability to hook them up individually as well as both on a single USB.  We also need to have the ability to do the same thing using Coax cable, so we can run them individually or together off a DVD player.  The monitors need to be hooked up to our Sound System so we can hear what is on the screen.  We want them mounted on the wood panels above the entrance doors on each side of the sanctuary stage - with a possible slight angle inboard.  
2.2	Contractor Services.  Acquire, deliver, and install the two monitors, install wires and hook them up to our sound system, and provide available warranties.

Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy.

Prior to contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the contractor shall agree that USAFA Security Forces may conduct a criminal history check, as applicable, on any or all employees performing on this contract. Criminal history checks may include accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to, any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses. If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract. The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC. The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.<br />(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned. The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>The item to be acquired is a modified version of the software package known as ProTrawler/Regatta.  This software package was produced for the FDA by Bioanalyte, Inc. over the course of several years.  The purpose of this package is to analyze data from experiments which are being conducted at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition to analyze bacteria using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.  This software package allows us to take experimental data and produce a profile of the proteins present in the sample.  We require a number of modifications to this software, as outlined in the statement of work.  In summary, we are requiring that the software package be modified to allow us to analyze data from different types of instruments (with different file formats), to perform additional calculations and data manipulations, and to modify the software to run in the Apple- Mac operating system known as Snow Leopard, which will allow us to run the software much faster and deal with larger data sets.It is not feasible to obtain these software modifications through full and open competition because ProTrawler/Regatta is a product for which we do not have access to the software code.  Only Bioanalyte, Inc, the developer of the software is capable of modifying it in a useful way.  The original versions of ProTrawler and Regatta were written for our requirements, and while ProTrawler has become a commercial product, it is not widely used.  There are no competitive software packages that can be used to perform the functions available in ProTrawler.  Consequently, while other sources can be sought, it is unlikely that there will be respondents other than BioAnalyte, Inc, since they would be unable to obtain the source code in order to modify the software.  The entire software package would have to be rewritten from scratch by another vendor, and this would require a completely new statement of work, since ProTrawler already has extensive functionality.  Should other vendors bid on this procurement, evaluation of those bids would have to be based on their ability to completely reproduce what already exists in ProTrawler (at no cost, since we have already paid for the development of ProTrawler) and this is unlikely.<BR><BR>

<DESC>06/04/2010: DOS is pleased to present the revised documents associated with amendment 01.
Please find the attached files including the SF-30, which provides further details concerning the amendment.  

DOS hereby extends the solicitation response date to Monday, June 21, at 5:00 PM EST.
Prospective Offerors shall contact Thomas C. Lemole through email (LemoleTC@State.Gov) for instructions concerning the revised versions of the restricted solicitation documents.  

END 06/04/2010 Posting. 


This notice replaces the previous posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005.  The Department of State (DOS) removed the previous www.fbo.gov posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005 for administrative convenience. DOS still considers SAQMMA10R0005 as an active solicitation and all dates and timelines including the mandatory synopsis period remain in effect.  

DOS  will now consider requests to attend the mandatory preproposal conference received by 1:00pm EDT Monday April 26.  


NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION (Posted April 15, 2010)

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms. DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components. 
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 

At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 
A. A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and
B. Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and
C. Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and
D. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and
E. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and
F. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul). Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance. 

SPECIAL NOTES: 
1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award. DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant. Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 
2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan. Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule

DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office. The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem. DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order. Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract. The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. 

The Question and Answer (Q &A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 26, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued. DOS intends to address as many of the industry questions as possible during the pre-proposal conference. DOS will post the answers to any questions not addressed during the pre-proposal conference via www.fbo.gov at a later date. Parties attending the pre-proposal conference may submit questions in writing at the end of the conference. Interested parties may submit additional questions up to May 12, 2010; 5:30 PM EDT. DOS will post answers to questions received at the conference and any additional questions via www.fbo.gov. 

Attendance at the site visit/preproposal conference is MANDATORY. DOS will reject proposals received from offerors who did not attend the site visit/preproposal conference. DOS intends to hold the conference in the Rosslyn area of Arlington, VA on Tuesday April 27 and Wednesday April 28. Offerors interested in attending must preregister by Monday 4:00pm Friday April 25, 2010. All interested parties SHALL FOLLOW-UP the e-mail correspondence with a phone call to Thomas C. Lemole at (703) 875-5852 to confirm receipt of the e-mail and to receive additional details and instructions concerning the site visit/preproposal conference. 
No more than three (3) representatives from each firm (to include potential subcontractors) may attend the site visit/preproposal conference. Interested parties SHALL BE READY to give Thomas C. Lemole notice of their interest by providing the name of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and Cage Code of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested parties who do not preregister WILL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. 
Offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this synopsis by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.fbo.gov to see if there are any changes.

<p>All individuals and/or firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quotes being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer, Ms. Terry Clark (316-759-4525) for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the response date of this RFI from 4 June 2010 at 2:00 p.m. EST. to 7 June at 12:00 p.m. EST.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center (NSRDEC) is seeking information on emerging technologies and technology concepts designed to physically or mentally unburden the Soldier and Small Combat Unit (SCU) of the future. Information received from this notice will be used to identify prospective participants in an Emerging Soldier Technologies (EST) Workshop to be conducted in late June, 2010 in conjunction with a Future Soldier Initiative (FSI) Capability Exercise (CapEx).<BR>NSRDECs mission is to maximize the Warfighters Survivability, Sustainability, Mobility, Combat Effectiveness and Quality of Life by treating the Warfighter as a System. NSRDECs Future Soldier Initiative (FSI) explores science and technologys role in enabling future capabilities for full spectrum operations with a focus on capabilities that Empower, Unburden, and Protect the Soldier and Small Combat Unit. .<BR>The FSI is charged with igniting the imagination and sparking discussion on how current and emerging research can best be directed to provide the Soldier and SCUs with unmatched capabilities that will help ensure success in future conflicts. The FSI objectives are pursued, in part, through a Capability Exercise (CapEx process that utilizes structured scenarios to guide the exploration of current and future capabilities by examining the actions and reactions of representative Soldiers, opposition forces, and the local populations within various defined parameters.<BR>The government will invite selected respondents to participate in an EST Workshop tentatively scheduled for 29-30 June 2010 at the Natick Soldier Systems Center in Natick, MA. During the Workshop, invitees will be invited to demonstrate their emerging technology or technology concept for a selected audience of Soldiers, CapEx participants, and government personnel. Invitees will also participate in roundtable discussions regarding Unburdening Soldiers and SCUs. [Note: The Government will not reimburse any business concern invited to participate in the workshop for costs associated with their invitation to or participation in the Workshop.]<BR>Unburdening technologies include those technologies, which, if implemented, would significantly reduce or off-load the physical or cognitive load placed on a Soldier/SCU, or increase the Soldier/SCU capacity to accept and process physical or cognitive load. Respondents to this request should submit technology concepts with potential to Unburden individual Soldiers or SCUs that are in the form of a prototype or other technology demonstrator that can be used to demonstrate the concept to Soldiers.<BR>Responses to this request must not exceed 10 pages (the Government may not review additional pages) and should address the following information: <BR>(1) Description: Describe the emerging technology and how a Soldier or SCU would potentially use the technology in an operational setting. <BR>(2) Impact: What is the anticipated impact of the technology on Soldiers/SCUs physical and cognitive load (please address each separately)? Please quantify your response to the maximum extent possible.<BR>(3) Prototype: Is a prototype or other technology demonstrator available to demonstrate the proposed technology? Please provide photographs or video as applicable. Minimum and desired space requirements for demonstration should also be included for workshop logistical planning purposes. <BR>(4) Availability: What is the availability of the prototype or technology demonstrator and necessary support personnel to attend the June, 2010 EST Workshop? <BR>(5) Current Customers: If applicable, please provide information on current customers for the proposed or closely related technology, including development/prototype efforts.<BR>(6) Contact Information: Please include a point of contact including email address, telephone number, and mailing address. <BR>NSRDEC personnel will review responses for suitability and applicability to the CapEx scenario and Unburdening theme. The Government, based on the objectives and criteria of this request, will make a determination as to a technologys suitability for invitation to the EST Workshop. The Government reserves the right to limit the number of invitations for participation in the Workshop based on resource and other limitations. Submissions may also be considered for invitation to participate in similar Workshops in the future at the Governments discretion.<BR>Submission of information in response to this request is completely voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are encouraged to submit only non-proprietary information, as the EST workshop will be attended by other non-governmental invitees. If proprietary information is submitted for review in response to this request for information, it must be marked appropriately, and the respondent should specify how it will present its technology at the Workshop without reference to proprietary data, which cannot be protected at the Workshop due to the presence of non-governmental personnel.<BR><BR>The information provided in response to this request for information will be used to identify potential invitees to participate in the outlined EST Workshop. As indicated above, the Government will not reimburse any business concern invited to participate in the Workshop for costs associated with such participation. No acquisition will result specifically from this notice or the follow-on workshop; however, future acquisitions may reflect performance capabilities identified during the contemporaneous CapEx, if such capabilities warrant further investigation or development. Response to this notice does not ensure an invitation to participate will be extended.<BR>All interested business concerns are required to respond to this request for information announcement via email no later than 7 June 2010, 12:00 p.m. EST. Attachments to submissions (e.g. optional video) larger than 5 MB shall be coordinated with the Government by email and submitted by internet link (provided via email), or electronic media (CD, DVD). Responses must include company point of contact, email address, telephone number, mailing address and fax numbers. All interested business concerns responding to this notice shall send their submission to Mr. Scott Ullery via email at scott.g.ullery@us.army.mil. All questions regarding this notice should be directed via email to Scott Ullery at scott.g.ullery@us.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Fort Bragg (MICCC-FB) would like to invite interested contractors to a follow-on conference regarding the services in support of the US Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCOE) and its subordinate elements, the United States Army Armor Center, and the United States Army Infantry Center.<br /><br />Based on the comments received from industry coupled with the initial review of the Army Services Strategy Panel (ASSP) by the Office of the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (OPARC) and the "lessons learned" on similar requirements the findings have resulted in several adjustments to the previously proposed acquisition strategy.  As a result, MICCC-FB will issue one solicitation resulting in the award of two (2) multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract suites [one suite for large business, and the second one reserved for small business].   The resultant contract(s) will include a twelve (12) month base period, four (4) one-year option periods, and FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  A minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 will apply to each award with a maximum ceiling of $458 million applicable to all MCOE support, regardless of the suite used to acquire the MCOE support services.  Approximately six (6) to eight (8) awards will be made under each contract suite.<br /><br />The conference will be held on Wednesday, June 23th 2010 from 0900-1200 at the Headquarters Infantry Center, Building 4, Classroom 6, Ft Benning, GA.  Please allow extra time for entry through the gate as Fort Benning is a closed Restricted Military Installation and your vehicle will be searched at the entrance gate.  Be sure to have proper photo identification, driver's license, current vehicle registration and proof of insurance. <br /><br />The conference facility is limited to 200 people.  Request that interested industry partners only bring a maximum of three (3) representatives.  Registration will be conducted on a first come basis.  Industry partners who do not register may not be allowed to participate depending on the number of registered attendees, thus registration is highly encouraged.  A similar sign-in table will be set in front of the conference location for participants to confirm registration and for unregistered participants to provide valid contact information. <br /><br />A registration form has been attached for your participation in the 3rd MCOE conference. Registrations for the conference must be submitted by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Friday, 18th June 2010. <br /><br />Please submit the registration form to Mr. Christian Freire at Christian.Freireacosta@us.army.mil or fax to (910) 396-5603. <br /><br />Interested industry participants and candidates may find a copy of the FINAL Request for Proposal (RFP) W91247-10-R-0002 and Attachments on or around Thursday, July 15th 2010 at the Army Single Face Industry website, https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/; or the Federal Business Opportunities website, https://www.fbo.gov. <br />

<p>PART: U.S. Government Procurement<br />SUBPART: Products<br />CLASSCODE: 58 - Communication, Detection, and Coherent Radiation Equipment<br />OFFADD: Federal Bureau of Prisons<br />Construction Contracting Section<br />320 First Street, NW, 500-6, Washington, D.C. 20534<br />SUBJECT: 58 -Provide trunked land mobile radio (LMR) systems and radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets. <br />SOL: RFPP0700CC1000005 `<br />DUE: N/A<br />POC: Joseph Bottoni, Contracting Officer, (202) 307-0954<br />DESC:</p>
<p><br />This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates awarding a fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity multiple-year (base year, plus 4 option years) contract for new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) systems to provide communications for officer safety and institutional operations. A typical configuration shall be a single site, trunked system, operating with-in UHF 406-420 MHz. The system shall have multiple repeater channels and use a 3600 baud control channel or higher. The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use. Each system must be equipped with an emergency alarm notification that must be received and transmitted through the trunking control channel. It is critical that immediate emergency notification be provided to a system dispatcher even when all voice channels are busy. The equipment shall include radio frequency (RF) infrastructure equipment and subscriber radios. Services will include: project management, systems engineering, design, staging, site preparation/development, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, and training. In addition to infrastructure equipment, FBOP sites may require an equipment shelter of an adequate size to house the proposed infrastructure equipment and management terminals, as well as an adequate work space. Infrastructure installation may also specify a provision for self-supporting tower (PiROD SU Series, or equivalent). In some instances, system installation may integrate an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). Site development could necessitate a generator to provide back up electrical power.</p>
<p>This requirement will include radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets. This requirement must provide for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective radio equipment back to factory specified operating condition. Prospective vendors must be capable of servicing existing digital, analog, conventional and trunked radio formats comprising of Motorola 3600 baud trunking infrastructure, conventional base stations, portable, mobile, and control products utilized by FBOP institutions, as well as the new equipment and systems proposed under this requirement. Maintenance service will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>1. Handheld and mobile radio depot level repair and preventive maintenance;<br />2. Annual system Survey and Analysis visits for infrastructure optimization;<br />3. On-site response to system outages and restoration to system malfunctions on a 24/7 service window;<br />4. Infrastructure circuit board and module repair;<br />5. Nation-wide network monitoring and remote diagnostics;<br />6. Telephone technical support; and <br />7. Centralized system management and on-site dispatch function to provide coordinated maintenance scheduling logistics support, engineering support, scheduling of all technical activities, and performance reporting on all scheduled and corrective maintenance activities provided to Institutions.</p>
<p>It is critical that each vendor, for this requirement, possess the capability to execute all equipment and service requirements. Comprehensive procurement and maintenance of all assets, by one vendor, will provide the FBOP assurance that all equipment will operate reliably under all circumstances, while eliminating the possibility of non-compatibility between individually serviced equipment. One vendor will ensure that the FBOP management of this program will not exceed current government work loads and resources.</p>
<p>Participation by small, small dis-advantaged, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and severe disabled veteran-owned businesses is encouraged. Faith-based and Community-based Organizations have the right to submit offers/bids equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. To be considered, firms must have at least five (5) years experience with projects of similar scope. Failure to identify all site personnel and provide requisite resumes may disqualify an Offeror from further consideration or result in a lower technical score. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are, with the exception of price, listed in descending order of importance: past performance (descending order of subfactors: Past Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment to Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), technical (descending order of subfactors: Technical Capabilities, Proposed Key Organization and Key Personnel, Quality Control/Quality Assurance, and Corporate Resources and Ability to Effectively Manage the Contract, with the following sub/subfactors: Corporate or Company Resources dedicated specifically to the management of this contract; Staff Training Program to include technical, health and safety, and supervisory training; Recruiting and Retention Plan; Health and Safety Plan; and Drug Free Workplace Policy), small business subcontracting, and price. Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Business Subcontracting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 9.104-1, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Government reserves the right to award to one or more vendors who will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each technical proposal will be evaluated qualitatively and categorized as in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation. A finding of Unacceptable in one technical factor may result in the entire technical proposal being found to be unacceptable. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price. Prospective Offerors are forewarned that an acceptable technical proposal and marginal past performance (if included as a factor) with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced proposal affords the Government the best value. The Government may elect to pay a premium price to select an Offeror whose non-cost/price evaluation factors (e.g., technical and past performance, if included) are superior.</p>
<p>This agency will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources. The solicitation, which includes instructions for submitting a quote, will be available on or about <br />July 26, 2010. This solicitation is unrestricted. Point of Contact of inquiries and clarifications is Joseph Bottoni, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, 320 <br />First Street, NW., Rm. 500-6, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC>NOTICE TO ALL OFFEROR(S)::::: The following are Questions and Answers regarding the Jewel Basin #5392 - Road Gravel Re-Surfacing and Laydown.

QUESTIONs: (1)  Regarding the above project and the fact that you cannot work between Memorial Day and Labor Day?  (2) How is the snow level to be addressed with, and how that will affect work?  (3) Currently you cannot get within 1.5 miles of the project end at the trail due to the snow and we are already beyond the first cut-off date? This only allows you to work the top end of the project after Labor Day?  (4) If you cannot work until after Labor Day, you conceivably will have snow at this elevation before you can complete the top portion of the project.  Can there be some work time adjustment possibly to allow work before Labor Day to help with the upper portion of the work/project?

ANSWER: The work ban  between Memorial and Labor Days is firm.  No will will be allowed during the summer - Jewel Basin recreation period.  We recognize the impact this places on the work and considered the limitation when setting the completion date out at October 01, 2011.   With the June 15 bid closing, we anticipate an award and notice to proceed is enough time to allow the procurement of the crushed aggregate materials this summer prior to September 06, Labor Day.  Snow records since the 1960's in Noisy Basin and measured 0.3 miles SE and 300 ft. higher elevation from the parking lot and the end of this project indicate that snow retention doesn't regularly begin in the basin until mid-October.  this translates into 5 - 6 weeks of working time in calendar year 2010, and an additional 3 weeks time in year 2011, 8 - 9 wks in aggregate, to complete reconditioning & gravel laydown work on the upper portion of the project.  The Snow in the lower portion begins melting out in the spring by early April. Hence, prior to Memorial Day this gives another 5 -6 wks of working in 2011, for a total of 13-15 wks.  The Government is aware that this project is a challenge.  The timing requirement will not let a contractor to be idle.  Passing haul traffic on the narrow road will also be a test of the Contractor's ability to organize work and equipment.  The suggestion:  Start work from high in 2010 & working one's way down the hill ahead of the weather and then using next Spring's time to work up the hill to close any gaps might be the key!
                                   END OF ANSWER.

<DESC>Using negotiated procedures similar to that found in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice contemplates award of up to three (3) fixed price contracts with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the counties that comprise the Northern District of Illinois. Pursuant to the Federal Debt Recovery Act, this procurement is strictly limited to law firms or solo practitioners of law. Additionally, eligibility for award is restricted to only those law firms or solo practitioners licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will be based on contingency fees for unsecured debt collection and firm-fixed prices for secured debt collection. The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be one (1) base year and up to four (4) option years. The solicitation will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov. Amendments to the solicitation issued prior to the receipt of proposals will also be posted on www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible to monitor this site for access to the solicitation. All responsible sources meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. It is highly recommended that, prior to submitting a proposal, all interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number, register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and complete online representations and certifications in ORCA, the Online Representations and Certifications Application, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award. Easy access to all three systems is found on the CCR homepage, www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>***UPDATE:  Amendment 001 has been posted as of June 04, 2010.


The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Mission Monrovia.  The U.S. Mission Monrovia requires a secure environment to conduct their mission.  The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement.  The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.  Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 

The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about May 20, 2010.  No paper copies will be mailed.  The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows:  The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days.  Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals.  All dates are subject to change.  Offerors will be notified.
A site visit is tentatively scheduled approximately twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens, at the U.S. Mission Monrovia.  A firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Monrovia.  Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit.

Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Matthew J. Colantonio at ColantonioMJ@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 



In accordance with 22 U.S.C.  4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

The proposed project consists of the replacement of old and deteriorated underground main steam and condensate lines in the system that are the direct buried main steam and condensate return service lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also includes other site work such as shoring, restoration of sidewalks, curbs and pavement, temporary lighting and temporary traffic controls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Replacing these lines will improve steam service reliability, and prevent future line ruptures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also substantially improve overall system efficiency through better-insulated lines, and increased condensate return to the heating plant. This project follows a FY 2006 prospectus project (HOTD Upgrade I), which consisted of the replacement of individual building steam service and condensate return lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The first project, HOTD Upgrade I is replacing buried steam &amp; condensate service lines that run between the main lines and individual Steam Service Customer buildings. The second project, HOTD Upgrade II will replace the buried Steam &amp; Condensate Main Lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Buried Main Steam Service and Condensate Return Lines within the GSA-HOTD system are between 40 to 75 years old, well beyond their expected service life, causing a significant increase in repairs, poor reliability, lower energy efficiency and higher operation costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The majority of the HOTD Upgrade II work will be performed underground; the total estimated project cost ranges between $20M and $30M, which includes an unforeseen site conditions/design contingency to compensate for the inevitable risks associated with underground utility work.

<DESC>The work consists of construction of a new Chapel and Mortuary Affairs Facility at Dover Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware along with all associated site work. The single story structure is approximately 19,343 square feet and is needed to provide a quality environment for religious, social and humanitarian functions for the base populace. In addition, as the Dover mortuary completes their efforts for fallen service members or Dignified Transfers (DT), a space of adequate size is needed to host families for memorial services and provide counseling. The Chapel is comprised of four (4) integrated programs as follows: 1) The Chapel and Chapel Support; 2) Administrative Spaces; 3) Education Spaces and 4) Mortuary Services. The Chapel will be constructed as a one-story facility and the design must be approved by the Dover Architectural Review Board. This acquisition will utilize the best value source selection process. The Source Selection Evaluation Factors are: Factor 1 Technical (which will include subfactors for Building Functionality and Aesthetics, site Design and Engineering, Quality of Building Systems and Materials Sustainability Requirements); Factor 2 Performance Risk (which will have subfactors for Specialized Experience, Design-Build Team, Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule, Organization/Technical approach, and Key Personnel Capabilities and Experience); Factor 3 Past Performance; Factor 4 Price; and Factor 5 Small Business Utilization. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than Acceptable must be achieved for the Technical, Performance Risk, Past Performance, Price, and Small Business Utilization factors. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER CONTRACT NO. AG-3A75-C-09-0020.

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is announcing award of Task Order AG-7482-D-10-0012 under Contract No. AG-3A75-C-09-0020.  The task order is for an independent design review of the watershed dam in the state of Mississippi - Town Creek Watershed Site 5.


The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  
	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
	Addresses unique site conditions 
	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

Contractor point of contract is Dan Vesey at (714) 317-3324, Square D Company,1415 South Roselle Road, Palatine, IL 60067.
Primary agency Contracting Officer is Chris Henschel (805) 982-3014.
Contract fund type for modification 04 is against task order 0002 and are provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
Proposed award for this modification was May 2010.
This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved as this is a follow-on order/modification to a competitive initial order (FAR 8.405-6 (B)(2).   
The current MACC has three companies in competition.  Each company offers a different solution in terms of meters choice, software programs, etc. based on the individual company's inherent capabilities as well as business/partnering relationships that they have.  Bringing in new contractors and subcontractors with different meters and communication equipment before the original NBVC AMI network is installed and commissioned violates good engineering, economic, and business sense.  The process of starting up any new communication network is highly technical and labor intensive, and requires a complex quality and information assurance process involving both the contractor and the Government.    In this specific case, installing and commissioning the NBVC AMI network is dependent on Square D Company engineers, firmware, software, computers, radios, NBVC site approvals, safety\security approvals, and other communication tools.  Given these many variables, adding a new contractor with different meters, communication components, and approvals at this time is logistically daunting, and will cause partial or even full duplication of specialized labor and materials. An award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The most important part of a successful AMI system is the communication network.  Installing this network and receiving authority to operate (ATO) requires a complete certification and authorization process, including a comprehensive information assurance plan with a CNIC N6 approved DIACAP package.  The existing network is not complete, and is awaiting essential components, including DIACAP approval, NBVC site approval, and a data acquisition server.    All these components depend on detailed technical information provided by the Square D Company.  Introducing a different contractor to extend the network and make changes to the existing components before completion introduces great risk to the Government.

Due to Sole Source Requirement

June 4, 2010
Solicitation Number: VA-244-10-RQ-0278

Erie VAMC
135 East 38th Street
Erie, PA 16504

Items to be procured:
The requirement is to provide two of each of the following types of Olympus equipment:

* CYF-V2:  VISERA Cysto-Nephro videoscope 
* WA05991A:  Instrument tray for scope

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

In order to provide the least variance in quality and cleaning preferences, which is necessary for patient safety, standardization must be followed.  The current scopes and towers used in the operating room are Olympus brand.  The operating room staff is currently trained on cleaning and operating the Olympus brand equipment.  The purchase of a new brand of scopes would require additional training to staff members in operation and cleaning processes.  By using standardized equipment and processes, the goals of VHA Directive 2009-004 - Use and Reprocessing of Reusable Medical Equipment (RME) in Veterans Health Administration Facilities; VHA Directive 1761.1 - Standardization of Supplies and Equipment Procedures; and VHA Handbook 1761.1 - Standardization of Supplies and Equipment Procedures can be more efficiently accomplished.  The addition of a new brand of scopes would require additional Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to be written (in accordance with VHA Directive 2009-004).  

Market research indicates that Olympus CYF-V2:  VISERA Cysto-Nephro videoscope and Olympus WA05991A:  Instrument trays for scope are only available from one source.  It is requested that this contract be awarded to the following contractor, who is an Olympus company:

Gyrus ACMI LP
6655 Wedgewood Road STE 160
Maple Grove, MN 55311-3613

Notice of Intent to Sole Source is expected to be posted to https://www.fbo.gov/ on Friday, June 4, 2010 with the expectation that the solicitation will be issued no later than Tuesday, June 9, 2010 with intent to award no later than June 25, 2010. 

Any inquiries and/or requests should be submitted in writing to Cynthia Grygier, Contract Specialist at cynthia.grygier@va.gov
