<DESC><br /> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request is issued solely for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) to obtain technical information for planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for technical information does not commit the Board to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is the independent governmental agency at the center of the Federal Reserve System, which also includes twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation. Together, these components are the nation's central bank and are responsible for conducting the nation's monetary policy and maintaining the stability of the financial system. The Board and regional Banks also share responsibility for supervising and regulating bank holding companies and state charted banks that are members of the System; for providing banking services to depository institutions, foreign official institutions, and the federal government; and for ensuring that consumers receive adequate information and fair treatment within the banking system.</p>
<p>The Board is required to have a devolution plan in place in the event that Board personnel are unable to perform their duties. The Technology Services (TS) section of the Management Division (MGT) at the Board is seeking an outside organization to support the Board during such a devolution situation. "Devolution" in this document implies that technical resources, other than the Board's, are needed to support Disaster Recovery (DR)/Business Continuity (BC) operations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be required to become familiar with TS' roles, operational procedures, and guidelines. Having an understanding and knowledge of TS practices will enable the Contractor to adequately fill-in for TS staff during the time when they are unavailable to perform duties as they relate to Essential Supporting Activity (ESA) 15-ASAP and IS Systems. ESA 15 covers the responsibilities to bring up and/or maintain the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications, including Oracle EBS and PeopleSoft HCM, during and following an incident that impacts their functionality.<br /> The initial contract will be for one (1) year, with options to renew for two (2) additional calendar years following a review of services rendered during the preceding contract period</p>
