<p align="left">The Contracting Officer MAY utilize online Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the online auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the online auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offerors' identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and the final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV.  If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov), or any other 3rd party provider, attachments may not be available or viewable to you.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, OK, has an ongoing requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The support is predominantly hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be primarily based at the MMAC, Oklahoma City, OK.   The current contracts statement of work (SOW) is provided as an attachment to this market survey to inform and assist interested vendors of the technical work required.  However, interested respondents are cautioned that the Government at its discretion may update and or revise this SOW prior to the close of the current contract and for any potential follow on contract.

At this time, the acquisition strategy and nature of competition has not been determined for any potential follow on contract. The Government welcomes statements of interest and capabilities from all small businesses, including service-disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small businesses, and 8(a) certified firms, which are capable of providing the required items and services.  However, contract performance has historically been set aside and achieved by fully certified 8(a) businesses.  It is the Governments intent to sustain the 8(a) set aside should results of this survey conclude that it is appropriate to do so.  Depending on responses to this survey and analysis of market research collected, the Government may, at its discretion, decide to pursue a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR OFFERS.  A SIR/Request for Offer may be made under a separate announcement in the future.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing vendor responses to this market survey. Therefore any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense. 

The Government has a strong desire to hear from prime contractors who can show they have the capacity to perform 100% of the work requirement, without sub-contracting or teaming with other contractors, for the contemplated follow on award for these services.  If interested contractors cant show capacity to perform 100% of the work requirement as the prime, it is requested that they respond with a percentage that represents what their total performance capacity is to complete the work as the prime or what they would suggest as a prime  to  sub percentage break down.  Aside from the Governments preference, interested respondents to this market survey are still required to show how the prime can meet the requirements of the Limitations in Subcontracts as defined in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitations on Subcontracting.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons) with a size standard of $38.5 million.     
 
The purpose of this announcement is to conduct a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors, in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1.  This market survey will enable the FAA to review responses that are current and will assist with acquisition planning based on current data.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  
HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:  Interested vendors should submit the items listed below to the point of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.

1.  Capability Statement. This document is limited to not more than five (5) pages and must include a brief description of the engineering, computer, and administrative services provided by your firm which are same/similar to those services outlined in this market survey and similar/same to the current contracts statement of work attached at the bottom of this survey.

2.  Performance Capacity.  Respondents must provide an indication of the percentage of work that can be performed by the prime contractor.  If the prime is not capable of performing 100% of the work requirement respondents need to show what their percentage capacity is to perform the work as a prime/sub arrangement.

3.  Business Declaration Form  Interested vendors must complete the attached Business Declaration Form and submit with their Capability Statement.  If applicable, a copy of the vendors SBA 8(a) Certification Letter is required.

<p>Description <br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Genetics Branch plans to procure on a sole source a maintenance service contract with Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide preventative maintenance for government owned Illumina HiScan and two Illumina MiSeqs.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Genetics Branch of CCR at the NCI is engaged in the study of cancer genetics. Investigating genetics alteration and its effect on the development and biology of cancer is an integral function of the Genetics Branch. By using ultra-high throughput, next generation sequencing and whole-genome high-resolution beadchip reagents, the NCI is able to study DNA/promoter interactions, gene expressions, methylation status, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and investigate genomic rearrangements.</p>
<p>The current requirement of the Genetics Branch is for a 12 month preventative maintenance for all labor, materials and equipment for Illumina HiSeq and two MiSeqs. All maintenance services shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's standard commercial maintenance practices. Contractor shall perform not less than one (1) preventive maintenance inspective during the contract period. Service shall be performed by a factory trained Field Service representative. Service shall consist of a thorough cleaning, calibration, adjusting, inspection, and testing of all equipment in accordance with manufacturer's latest established service procedures. All equipment shall be operationally tested through at least one (1) complete operating cycle at the end of the preventive maintenance inspection to assure optimum and efficient performance.</p>
<p>Illumina, Inc. is the sole company that can service the Illumina Genome Analyzer and Illumina HiScan currently in the CCR lab. Illumina is the manufacturer of the Genome Analyzer and HiScan and is the sole source for the service. The Solexa Genome Analyzer extended warranty includes coverage of software related to the Genome Analyzer and the HiScan which is proprietary and protected under patent rights and thereby is unavailable from other sources than the original manufacturer. Use of any other service agreements on these instruments would void support of the equipment by Illumina.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EST, on February 10, 2015. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed 240-276-5401 or emailed to Kimesha Leake, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at kimesha.leake@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N02RC52524-24 on all correspondence.</p>

Laser Engraver Minimum Government Required Specifications: The configuration of the General Workshop offers limited workspace for a laser engraver, the overall workspace allotted for an engraver and exhaust system is w75? x h57? x d55?.  Maximum size of an engraver should be no more than w36? x h38?x d36? and a standalone exhaust should be no bigger than w38.5? x h17? x d17?.  To accommodate our electrical configuration the system will have to be no greater than 125volt, 10amp compatibility.  The engraver will require a standalone enclosed exhaust system given our workshop?s installed ventilation system inability to produce the necessary air pull to remove hazardous gases produced by the laser.  The increased airflow by a standalone exhaust system will also improve the end product by making a cleaner working environment.   With this exhaust system the engraver should also have a cutting table, or honeycomb, which allows for ventilation from above and below the work space.  Underways and deployments require our shop to have the maximum capability allotted by the space.  Often engravers have attachments which focus the laser and reduce divergence of the laser which allows for cleaner, crisper, and more detailed engravings. The system should have the CO2 and Fiber laser attachments, each allow for engraving on different materials increasing our capabilities.  It should have a Rotary Fixture which allows us to engrave cylindrical objects and glassware which can then be offered as gifts to visiting dignitaries and other representatives.  An engraver will need a laptop with CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X7 installed as its software., 1, LO; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9mL6agX5DtyNQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with AB Sciex LLC, North American Sales and Service, 1201 Radio Road, Redwood City, CA 94065 to provide a Maintenance Service Agreement (MSA) for the 4800 Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer.  The EPA laboratory at Research Triangle Park, NC has been equipped with the 4800 Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer.  The service plan includes parts, labor and travel for remedial repair; 2 PM visits; guaranteed priority response time 2 business days after receipt of service call; priority telephone and email access to instrument technical support; telephone and email access to application technical support and smart services remote monitoring, which provides for notification to customer of instrument failures or errors that are reported by smart services monitoring software.  AB Sciex, LLC is the sole manufacturer of the 4800 Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer that includes proprietary hardware and can only be serviced by A B Sciex, LLC.  EPA believes that this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for this particular instrument.  In addition, AB Sciex has the exclusive rights to the software, hardware, and operating licenses for this equipment.

<a href="mailto:williams.louis@epa.gov">RFQ-RT-15-00032</a>
<DESC>The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this acquisition to Data Sciences International.  Therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  The U.S. EPA?s Office of Research and Development, Immediate Office of the Assistant Administrator (IOAA) is in need of an exchange of 22 ETA-F10 mouse transmitters and an upgrade of 10 C50-PXT, rat blood pressure transmitters to 10 HD-S11 models.  The EPA laboratory monitors electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and activity by using transmitters (aka telemeters) to assess the effects of air pollutants and elucidate mechanism of action.  The Data Sciences International, Inc. (DSI) PhysioTel? Implantable Telemetry is designed for monitoring and collecting data. The implantable transmitter senses, processes and transmits information via telemetry from within an animal. The transmitter is only one component of the complete DSI System which includes software, acquisitio n hardware, and calibration hardware. With these devices, researchers and scientists can measure arterial pressure, ECG, temperature, activity, and temperature among other parameters.  The ETA-F10 transmitters are used to measure biopotential (ECG), temperature and activity data in mice. The ETA-F10 is the smallest of the single channel biopotential transmitter series. The ETA-F10 is most commonly used for cardiovascular research, where ECG and heart rate data are desired.  Designed for small animals, the HD-S11 has one catheter for measuring pressure and one biopotential lead for measuring ECG signals. Temperature and activity are also simultaneously recorded. This implant has several advancements over its predecessor - the C50-PXT ? including improved physiologic measurement sensitivity, auto-loading of calibration data reduces configuration time and eliminates data entry error, animal ID ensures data collection is from the intended animal, and battery ON-time counter help s track study duration and remaining battery life.  The justification for sole source procurement of the above components is based on the following factors: 1) ? the measurement of blood pressure by intra-arterial catheterization is considered by the EPA to be the only reliable method of measuring blood pressure in laboratory rodents; 2) - these telemeters and all accompanying required equipment are manufactured by Data Sciences International; 3) - after being used, these telemeters require refurbishment.  DSI is the only company that produces this proprietary telemeter model.  No other transmitter will work with our DSI hardware and software systems.  Thus, DSI is the only company that can exchange these used telemeters (ETA-F10s for mice and C50-PXTs for rats) for new telemeters; 4) - note that DSI no longer manufactures (and refurbishes) C50-PXTs and has replaced them with a newer model (i.e. HD-S11s).  Thus, EPA must exchange its expired C50-PXT models for the replacemen t HD-S11 models. DSI transmitters are proprietary and DSI does not have re-sellers or distributors.  DSI is the sole provider of DSI transmitters in the U.S.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1 Sole Source, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required product or a similar product that meets the above described requirements should fully explain their product capabilities and qualifications in writing within 5 days from the date of this announcement.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Development of More Effective/Universal Influenza Vaccines
<SOLNBR>BARDA_Universal_Influenza_Synopsis
<CONTACT>Matthew A. McCord, Contracting Officer, Email matthew.mccord@hhs.gov - Kevin Nilles, Contracting Officer, Email kevin.nilles@hhs.gov
<DESC>Prevention of disease caused by seasonal and novel influenza strains of pandemic potential continues to be a public health challenge. Vaccination is the primary medical intervention for prevention of infection with these viruses. Seasonal influenza vaccines, which are produced and administered annually, are only 30% to 70% effective. Excess morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza virus disease can be devastating in terms of years of life lost and economic productivity. The emergence of novel strains of influenza viruses presents a public health threat, with potential rapid global spread among people with no pre-existing immunity to the virus, causing catastrophic morbidity and mortality.
<p><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), is launching a new initiative supporting the advanced development of influenza vaccine candidates with the goal to provide enhanced, long-lasting protection from a broad range of antigenically divergent influenza viruses within and across subtypes. These new vaccines will be more effective than current vaccines in providing protection from influenza infection in people of all ages and in people generally considered high-risk for severe disease associated with influenza infection. Additionally, these new vaccines may serve as a priming dose during non-pandemic periods to enable a single dose of a pandemic influenza vaccine to be effective. As such, promising experimental data providing evidence that the new vaccine may serve as a primer for a pandemic influenza vaccine booster will be evaluated favorably. Offerors are required to develop these vaccine candidates towards final FDA licensure for prophylaxis against disease caused by seasonal and pandemic influenza.</p>
<p><br />HHS/ASPR Acquisition Management, Contracts and Grants (AMCG) intends to publish a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support the advanced development of new influenza vaccines that are more effective than currently licensed vaccines as a step towards development of a universal influenza vaccine with potential prime- boost vaccine properties for pandemic influenza. This RFP will provide additional details regarding the desired characteristics for the development towards a universal influenza vaccine candidate through a defined target product profile (TPP). BARDA contemplates a single or multiple contract award(s) to develop, manufacture, and evaluate more effective influenza vaccine candidate(s) toward US licensure. Offeror(s) shall demonstrate their ability to meet the following mandatory criteria:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of greater cross-reactive immune responses elicited by the proposed influenza vaccine candidates compared to U.S.-licensed seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines from proof-of-concept in-vitro and relevant animal studies,</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of progress towards advanced development of proposed influenza vaccine candidates from Phase 1 dose-ranging clinical studies that demonstrates the vaccine candidate is well tolerated and able to induce cross-reactive immune responses to a range of antigenically divergent influenza viruses,</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of commitment for U.S. licensure of vaccine product from documentation of an investigational new drug (IND) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, AND</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of domestic manufacturing capability, either alone or in partnership with other manufacturers, or plans for technology transfer to a domestic production site.</p>
<p><br />The anticipated period of performance includes a four to five year base period with a four to five year option period. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. The RFP will be available electronically through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (www.fbo.gov) on or about February 11, 2015, with proposals being due on or about April 11, 2015.</p>
<p><br />Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor this website (www.fbo.gov) for the release of the solicitation as well as any subsequent amendments to the solicitation. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via www.fbo.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions of proposals will be accepted. All responses and/or inquiries concerning this requirement MUST be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, email address and should be submitted to the primary and/or secondary point of contact identified in this notice.</p>
<p><br />Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of September 2015.</p>

<DESC><p>General Services Administration (GSA) seeks to lease the following space:</p>
<p>State:	Virginia<br />City:	Arlington<br />Delineated Area:	Crystal City Submarket<br />Minimum Sq. Ft. (ABOA):	54,280 ABOA<br />Maximum Sq. Ft. (RSF):	63,688 RSF<br />Space Type:	Office<br />Parking Spaces (Total):	0<br />Parking Spaces (Surface):	0<br />Parking Spaces (Structured):	0<br />Parking Spaces (Reserved):	0<br />Full Term:	9 years<br />Firm Term:	9 years <br />Option Term:	None<br />Additional Requirements:	See Below.<br /> <br />The Government currently occupies 18,895 rentable square feet (RSF), yielding 16,231 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet, of office and related space in a building under a lease in the Crystal City submarket of Northern Virginia that will expire on March 16, 2024. The Government has a requirement for an additional 44,793 RSF, yielding 38,049 ABOA SF, of office and related space.  Accordingly, the Government is seeking expressions of interest from sources of office and related space for a total of approximately 63,688 RSF, which shall yield a minimum of 54,280 ABOA square feet of office and related space.  Offered buildings must be located within 2,640 walkable linear feet (wlf) from a Metrorail station measured along accessibility compliant, paved pedestrian pathways from a main entrance of the offered building to the accessibility compliant entrance to the Metrorail station.  Offered space must be capable of meeting ISC Level III security requirements, as determined by the Government in its sole discretion.    Offered space must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.  The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced.  Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's entire requirement for a nine year term, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc. <br />The Government's decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this notification.  In the event that a potentially acceptable offer fails to provide required information as part of its response to this notification, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Submission by anyone other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space.  In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest should include the following:</p>
<p>1) 	Building name &amp; address; <br />2) 	Contact information and e-mail address of Lessor's Representative;<br />3) 	ABOA and rentable square feet available (identifying the specific floors and square footage on each, with Common Area Factor) and its condition (shell, or built-out, and if so for whom);      <br />4) 	Asking rental rate per ABOA and rentable square foot, fully serviced;<br />5)   Amount of tenant improvement allowance included in quoted rental rates;<br />6)   A description of additional tenant concessions offered, if any;<br />7)	Date building will be ready for commencement of tenant improvements; and <br />8) 	Evidence that the offered space will meet the other specific requirements identified herein.</p>

<DESC>The Norfolk District, Army Corps of Engineers is contemplating a Firm Fixed Price, Design-Build Construction contract for the construction of a new combined heat and power plant (CHPP) at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP), Radford, Virginia.  <br>  <br> Background - <br>  <br> There is a need for the Army to replace the circa 1941 powerhouse with a modern combined heat and power plant (CHPP) at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, Radford, Virginia (RFAAP) due to current facility infrastructure passing economically useful life creating an unacceptable risk of impact to plant operations and the requirement of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT), issued on 31 January 2013 as part of 40 CFR Part 63 of the Clean Air Act, mandating all major air emitting sources meet more stringent Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) emission standards.  The Government has determined it is not economically justifiable to retrofit advance air emission control measures into the existing power plant.   <br>  <br> RFAAP is a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GOCO) energetic materials manufacturing facility established in 1941.  RFAAP is the principal domestic source of propellants for small, medium, and large caliber ammunition and some missiles. <br>  <br> The intended contract action is for the award of a contract for full design-build services to design, construct, test, commission, and train new operating staff for a new CHPP that can generate 16 megawatts of electricity and 460,000 lbs/hour of superheated steam.  Associated equipment/spaces include but are not limited to the following: natural gas fired combustion turbines, dual fuel (natural gas and fuel oil) steam boilers, emergency/black start reciprocating generator, steam turbine(s), compressed air system, boiler feed water systems, chilled water system, brine maker, electrical switchgear, electrical substation, monitoring and control systems, emissions control systems, control room and administrative spaces. <br>  <br> This project will be solicited as unrestricted following a two-phase best value procurement process in accordance with FAR Part 15 and 36.3.  The contracting officer will award a firm fixed price contract to the responsible offeror in accordance with FAR 9.1, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and offers the best overall value to the Government, determined through a two phase evaluation. The factors for Phase 1 are anticipated to consist of the following:  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization, Technical Approach, and Key Personnel.   The Phase 2 evaluation is anticipated to consist of price and the following non-price factors:  Power Generation and Emissions Performance Guarantees, Design Concepts, Quality of Materials, Schedule, Key Subcontractors, and Small Business Participation. <br>  <br> The magnitude of construction is between $50,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 237130, Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction, with a small business size standard of $36.5 million.   <br>  <br> Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data <br> obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror. <br>  <br> The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. Paper copies of this solicitation will not be available.  Other methods of requesting a package will not be honored. This solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov on/about February 13, 2015. The proposal due date shall be at least 30 days after the RFP is posted on the FBO website. IT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFEROR TO CONTINUALLY VIEW THE WEBSITE FOR CHANGES. <br>  <br> All prospective contractors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to contract award.

<DESC><strong>Background</strong>
<p>The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) for the Department of Defense and is the single entity to direct and supervise execution of the strategic distribution system. The mission of USTRANSCOM is to provide full-spectrum global mobility solutions and related enabling capabilities for supported customers' requirements in peace and war. USTRANSCOM has a responsibility to improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution related activities within the Department of Defense (DoD). USTRANSCOM is the contracting activity for surface transportation requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>A requirement exists for transportation services to move repairable parts to all 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, Alaska, and Canada. The parts will be transported from two parent sites called Hubs, located on the West (San Diego, CA) and East (Norfolk, VA) Coasts, and smaller sites called Nodes, as well as other DoD and electronic Retrograde Management System (eRMS) enabled activity's and contractor facilities. The Norfolk site is considered a Hub for material receipt, consolidation and shipping purposes. San Diego is a Hub for the same receiving, consolidation and shipping purposes, but is also designated as the sole Transportation Oversight/Management Hub. Repairables from nodes/e-RMS activities located outside of the continental United States (OCONUS), as well as mobile expeditionary node material, is occasionally shipped to a DoD point of entry using Government assets. Other transportation phases of the program include express service for Repair and Return (R&amp;R) shipments.</p>
<p>The Advanced Traceability and Control (ATAC) II program is a Navy initiative for the tracking, tracing, packing, reporting, and movement of high dollar Depot Level Repairables (DLR) Product Lines like Not Ready For Issue (NRFI) Carcass Express (CE) and Routine (RT) priority items from point of failure to a repair facility, and ultimately back to the end user after repair of assets that are Ready for Issue (RFI) or on a Redistribution Order (RDO). ATAC II is also responsible for transporting RFI Offloads, Repair and Return (R&amp;R), Marine Aviation, Ground Marine (GM) and Coast Guard material, and Aircraft Engines.</p>
<p>The transportation services provided shall include the consolidated movement of NRFI material, RDO material, RFI material, and Carcass Express/Routine material to/from the US &amp; Canada. Repair parts range in a wide variety of sizes, from circuit cards, cardboard boxes, wooden crates and metal cans to items larger than a complete aircraft. The contractor shall seek improvements which will focus on distribution-related functions and its effects on the total Supply Chain; improving overall levels of support to the warfighter while significantly increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>The contractor shall consolidate and package/palletize freight of all kind ATAC II assets received for shipments into the best available aggregate shipment for the most cost effective and efficient rate while still meeting consolidation time, transit time and delivery requirements. For assets weighing less than 150 lbs and for which the contractor cannot effectively consolidate while meeting consolidation time, transit time and delivery requirements, the contractor shall coordinate the shipment of these packages with the DoD Domestic Express Carriers.</p>
<p>The NAICS for this effort is 484230, Specialized Freight (except Used Goods) Trucking, Long-Distance. The acquisition strategy of this requirement has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The solicitation for this acquisition will be released electronically and will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov. The Request for Proposal is anticipated to be released on or about 2 March 2015.</p>

<p>Sources Sought</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential small business sources qualified and able to perform laundry and dry cleaning service requirements at McConnell AFB, Kansas. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information / sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The estimated contract period including all options is 1 October 2015 through 30 September 2020. The successful contractor shall provide laundry and dry cleaning services for the locations designated in the contract in compliance with all local, state, and Federal laws. The Performance Work Statement requires that the contractor provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform laundry and dry cleaning services for linens, rags, uniforms and other miscellaneous items, to include delivery and pickup services. Attached you will find the Estimated Annual Workload, which provides a list of all known items associated with the requirement at this time. These services are funded by both non-appropriated and appropriated funds. The NAICS code for this requirement is 812320, Drycleaning and Laundry Services (except coin-operated). The Small Business Size Standard is $5,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government requests interested parties submit a brief statement of current capability to perform these services and a letter of interest. Interested and qualified sources should provide the following information: (1) company name, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, type of business and size [i.e.; Small, SBA Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone), Women Owned, and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO)]; (2) a list of your most recent and relevant DoD and/or commercial contracts (not to exceed ten) to include a brief description, names, POCs, phone numbers, value &amp; type of contract, and period of performance; and (3) information about your company and why you think you can perform this service.

In order to be considered in this market survey, please reply by close of business, 4:00 pm CST, 13 February 2015.</p>
<p>22 CONS is interested in quantifying and pre-qualifying the likelihood of setting aside competition for laundry and dry cleaning services for McConnell AFB to a small business. Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 22 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns. This announcement serves as a first step for 22 CONS to determine the viability of setting aside the procurement for laundry and dry cleaning services for competition solely within or among certain small businesses in selected categories. Please note that the Small Business Administration (SBA) currently has this requirement under the 8(a) Program in accordance with 13 CFR 124. This is a Sources Sought announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation shall not receive a response.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on the FedBizOpps website at www.fbo.gov. Potential interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package as well as downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.</p>
<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 2014)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU/HQ AFICA /SMC ombudsman level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2395, facsimile number (571) 256-2431. <br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />Points of Contact<br />SSgt David White, Contract Specialist, phone (316) 759-4098, e-mail david.white.40@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Request For Information<br />Legislative Clock System<br />Architect of the Capitol
<p>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) for its Legislative Clock System (LCS) requirement. This is for market research purposes only. This LCS requirement will be used to develop, design and build a new alternate LCS that can be used in conjunction with the existing Spectracom system. This requirement is not to replace the existing Spectracom system in its entirety. Instead it will replace the existing Spectracom clocks with the new LCS clocks as replacements are needed.</p>
<p>The Buy American Act will apply to this requirement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to allow industry to provide comments to AOC on the stated requirements and state if a solution per the Government's requirements is feasible. In addition, the AOC is asking that vendors provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to provide an estimate on what the total cost of this project may be. Vendors are requested to include in their ROM the total labor price, total equipment price, total manufacturing and price for purchasing rights to vendor's design specifications to arrive at the total estimated price. The vendor does not have to provide its response to the RFI or the ROM in accordance with the instructions in Section L. Sections L &amp; M are provided so that the vendors can&nbsp;submit comments to these sections along with comments to the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>This RFI is also conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for AOC's LCS requirement. Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded an AOC procurement. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM profile. Vendors shall also state if they participate in any Government wide contracts such as General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule.</p>
<p>This is not a Request For Proposals. Proposals are not being solicited nor will an award be made from this RFI. AOC will not reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this RFI. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI shall be sent to Jennifer Henley at jhenley@aoc.gov. Responses are due no later than 4:00 pm ET on January 23, 2015.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">West Point is located on approximately 16,000 acres on the west bank of the Hudson River, roughly 50 miles north of New York City. West Point is home to approximately 4,300 cadets and 8,000 officers, enlisted, civilian staff, and faculty members (and their families) whose primary duty is to educate and train the cadets. Additionally, an estimated three million tourists from around the world visit West Point every year. The purpose of West Point is "to provide the Nation with leaders of character who serve the common defense." The mission of West Point is "to educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country; professional growth throughout a career as an officer in the United States Army; and a lifetime of selfless service to the nation."</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">West Point is designated as a National Historic Landmark District (NHLD). NHLD status is the highest designation given to historic properties by the Federal Government and represents nationally significant historic places that possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. Consequently, all undertakings that have the potential to effect the NHLD designation are subject to the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (as amended). The transfer of historic properties out of Federal control without any legally enforceable restrictions that ensure their long-term preservation constitutes an "adverse effect" (36 C.F.R. &sect;</span><span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: #333333; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN"> </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">800.5). As a result, West Point must consult with the New York State Historic Preservation Office, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and any other consulting party to ensure there are legally enforceable provisions that will ensure the long-term preservation of any historic structures that are transferred out of Federal control.</span></p>

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Investigative Services (FIS) located at 1137 Branchton Rd., Boyers, PA 16018 is issuing this Sources Sought for Consulting Services for their existing Cost Allocation Model (CAM) using the Systems, Applications, and Products (SAP) Profitability &amp; Cost Management (PCM) software tool. The FIS CAM, originally built in 2012, is based on FIS' business processes and object class expenditures to capture full organizational costs. The CAM provides visibility into the costs of FIS operations, including the full cost of individual activities performed in support of different types of background investigations, and establishes an appropriate and equitable method for allocating indirect and support costs to the investigation processes, activities, and ultimately its individual products. FIS has used SAP PCM to develop its past two fiscal year CAMs, and plans to use SAP PCM to develop improved CAMs for future fiscal years.
<p>FIS is seeking sources for two specific purposes: (1) enhance FIS' Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) understanding and, (2) support the growth, enhancement, and employment of FIS' future CAMs in SAP PCM. Sources with MCA and SAP PCM model development will: (1) best support FIS in future pricing, (2) help FIS identify the differences in cost structure for Federal employee-versus contractor-led investigations, (3) link the cost of operations to the different fees charged to recover the organization's costs, (4) design a repeatable process to develop cost data to support fee studies, and (5) provide FIS with the required expertise to operate and adapt the CAM as needed.

Provide continuous out-year support of cost and pricing projections, and other cost analyses employing CAM.<br />6. Ensure cost-driving processes and activities are properly captured in order to continue with a flexible and responsive model through monthly evaluations<br />7. Provide consulting on change management for implementation of new methods and processes<br />8. Train FIS on change management processes<br />9. Develop standard operating procedures (SOP) with FIS for SAP PCM</p>
<p>B. Ongoing retained earnings and forecasting analysis support <br />1. Assist FIS with improving workload forecasting techniques, including: <br />i. Internal process description<br />ii. Description of interaction with other planning and operating processes (budget formulation and execution, rate setting, capacity management, billing, etc.)<br />iii. Assessment of current process<br />iv. Analysis of variances in forecast vs. actual by product and customer <br />v. Provide recommendations to improve overall forecasting process on a quarterly basis<br />2. Assist FIS with improving retained earnings management, including:<br />i. Spend/revenue analysis<br />ii. Retained Earnings position calculation<br />iii. Monthly recommendations on improved approach to predict and manage operating reserve levels<br />3. Revise and update CAM to incorporate tiered investigations<br />4. Revise and update CAM to calculate item-level costs<br />5. Support integration with FIS Source data systems - CBIS, ETAMS, PIPS and other data systems<br />6. Development of data extract, transformation, load routines and tables in data warehouse<br />7. Develop automated routines to update model with costs, labor and workload data</p>
<p>C. Train FIS personnel on MCA and SAP PCM techniques and best practices, to include the following:<br />1.

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>1.	Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH)/ National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/ Division of Intramural Research (DIR)  is the nation's leading medical research agency whose mission is to support and conduct world-class research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke.</p>
<p>Research within the DIR depends on confocal imaging microscopy and necessitates the older confocal microscopes currently being utilized be replaced with modern technology able to offer the level of performance and sensitivity required by cutting edge research programs. Existing instruments lack features found in newer equipment and needed by our researchers such as the ability to maintain constant focus for extended periods of time, possession of motorized stages to allow for seamless multi-field image acquisition, inclusion of detectors required for specialized imaging modalities such as low-abundance or high-count fluorescent markers, and spatial resolution better than the diffraction limit of visible light (0.2 um). These capabilities are needed in our laboratories in addition to the field support, warranty services, manufacturer's training, manufacturer's certification, and access to proprietary parts and software information offered by more modern systems and required to keep the equipment in manufacturer's working condition.</p>
<p>NINDS currently requires three new confocal microscopes: one for the shared NINDS Light Imaging Facility (LIF), one for the Synpatic Function Section (SFS), and one for the Synapse and Neural Circuit Unit (SNC).</p>
<p>2.	Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain three confocal imaging platforms for NINDS investigators meeting the specifications within the Statement of Work and the respective attachments.  <br /> <br />3.	Scope</p>
<p>3.1.	General requirements applicable to all three (3) microscopes</p>
<p>NINDS/DIR intends to obtain confocal imaging platforms able to meet the challenges of biomedical research such as handling live or fixed specimens, from sub-cellular structures to whole animals, and fluorescent probes, including organic dyes and indicators, fluorescent antibodies, and endogenous markers. NINDS/DIR studies require the ability to image multiple fluorescent probes and the ability to image live specimens when the sample must be kept alive under the microscope for extended periods of time; the latter requires the instrument to provide the appropriate temperature, gas, and humidity level and furthermore since live specimens are sensitive to photo-damage the instrument must keep laser exposure as low as possible. The platforms must perform at speeds able to image fast moving and dynamic phenomena and possess specialized devices to keep the focus constant during long-term imaging experiments. For both live and fixed specimens, spatial resolution is needed for studies that require accurate localization of small cellular structures within a single nerve cell. <br />The software for the confocal system must include capability for   multitrack imaging by linewise and framewise switching of the laser excitation lines, spectral imaging, tiled image acquisition with seamless stitching, and user-defined sequential imaging protocols (including multi-positional z-stacks and time series with variable laser intensities).  The supplier must provide at least three days of initial training and provide continuing application support, when requested, within three business days. The system must be under full warranty (parts and service) for two years from the date of purchase. A third year of service support (excluding parts) must be included, with the option to purchase complete maintenance coverage (parts and service) for at least five additional years.  <br />1:  Delivery to installation sites.  See infra Deliverables/Delivery Schedule section.<br />2:  Complete installation of 3 microscopes and accessory parts, each meeting the specifications of         the 3 stated research programs. See Attachments A (LIF), B (SFS), and C (SNC).<br />3:  Initial training and ongoing application support. <br />4:  12-month full warranty. <br />5: One additional year (second-year) extended full warranty. <br />6: A third-year warranty for service (not including parts).</p>
<p>3.2.	Enhanced resolution imaging for LIF and SFS and upgrade path for SNC:</p>
<p>The LIF and SFS require systems with an enhanced resolution imaging modality designed to image living samples while the system for SNC must include an on-site upgrade path for this enhanced imaging modality. The system must minimize the intensity and dose of excitation light so that unbiased data can be obtained from live samples during 3D acquisitions or long-term time-lapse recordings because continuous exposure to excitation light can induce cell damage (phototoxicity caused by the generation of free oxygen radicals) as well as photobleaching (and consequent loss of signal). The detector must be designed to maximize quantum efficiency (numbers of photons collected) and to minimize noise so as to optimize signal detection while allowing low levels of laser illumination. Moreover, the system must be able to rapidly collect images in order to monitor fast cellular activities such as exocytosis of vesicles (which also limits the numbers of photons that can be collected) and optimize spatial resolution which is essential for visualizing small cellular structures (at the expense of SNR).</p>
<p>The enhanced resolution imaging modality must be applicable to the wide variety of fluorescent probes used by scientists in the DIR (organic dyes, fluorescent antibodies in many colors, fluorescent proteins) and must not require intense laser illumination. These requirements preclude techniques based on Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED), any localization-based imaging methodology such as PALM or STORM or any confocal imaging technique utilizing a reduced pinhole (&lt;1 Airy Unit). We have carefully evaluated structured illumination techniques available from different vendors and found them lacking, in particular because they all require recording multiple images and are not well suited for imaging fast motile and dynamic events in live specimens, i.e., nerve cells.  A more detailed list of requirements can be found in Attachments A (LIF), B (SFS), and C (SNC).</p>
<p>The enhanced resolution modality must feature a 1.7 fold higher resolution in all three dimensions as the higher resolution is necessary for meeting current research needs. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise (S/N) is required in order to image low-expressing signals in live specimens. The aforementioned mandate a detector which consists of at least 32 elements (Gallium arsenide Phosphide or equivalent), each of which collects a part of the light emitted from the focal spot in the sample; the contributions from each of these elements must be able to be combined by linear deconvolution, functionally reducing the pinhole diameter (to ~ 0.2 Airy Units) without reducing the signal. The computational step must be performed simultaneously to 2-D imaging so the benefits of improved resolution and SNR are visible in real-time (post-processing should not be required).</p>
<p>The DIR proposes to acquire three confocal instruments. All instruments must be based on a common hardware and software foundation to minimize training and support and allow for cost efficiencies, but each instrument must also be tailored to the specific needs of the location where it will be put in service.</p>
<p>One will be located in the Light Imaging Facility (LIF) and configured to meet the various needs of a large and diverse user base. It must include a highly sensitive multi-channel detector capable of full spectral imaging (in a single scan, not sequentially), high-count dye imaging with emission fingerprinting capabilities, and configurable to simultaneously capture fluorescence from as many as ten probes. In addition, it must have a separate detector (Airy Detector or equivalent) with significantly enhanced sensitivity and resolution (1.7 fold in x, y and z). See Attachment A for threshold specifications.</p>
<p>The second instrument will be placed in the Synaptic Function Section (SFS, Dr. Zuhang Sheng). This instrument must be equipped with an Airy detector/equivalent to facilitate localization of small protein clusters that are on or within motile organelles along neuronal long processes such as axons and at synaptic terminals. See Attachment B for threshold specifications.</p>
<p>The third instrument will go to the Synapse and Neural Circuit Unit (SNC, Dr. Wei Lu). Dr. Lu operates a new laboratory that lacks a required confocal microscope. The group requires more microscope time than the LIF allows. The instrument for SNC must be configured for optigenetic experiments on transgenic neurons expressing light-sensitive ion channels. See Attachment C for threshold specifications.</p>
<p>4.	See Attachments for Additional Technical Requirements and Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>a)	Specific Requirements for LIF: See SOW Attachment A.<br />b)	Specific Requirements for SFS: See SOW Attachment B.<br />c)	Specific Requirements for SNC: See SOW Attachment C.</p>

The scope of the NBS includes these business or "functional" areas: acquisition, travel, service and supply fund, supply, research and development contracting, property, and financial management. The NBS is a fully integrated facility that supports these functional areas and interfaces with other major NIH and Departmental systems. "Best practices" i.e., those business processes determined to be most effective in the business community, have been and continue to be identified for the administrative areas at the NIH. Implementation will require configuration or changes to the system that will adopt and integrate these best practices. Functional teams under the direction of a functional team manager have been established to oversee this effort. Functional teams will engage in a variety of duties including the design and configuration of the system, establishing workflow for the business processes, customization of the system, defining system interfaces, and participation in pre-deployment and deployment activities.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in February.  <br /><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the &ldquo;Register to Offer Space&rdquo; link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides are offered in the &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;. <br /><br /> The Open Period for February is February 1, 2015 to February 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /><br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced. <br /><br /> If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates&rsquo; tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.  <br /><br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.  <br /><br />DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Westchester County, Nassau County, or Suffolk County.  <br /><br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed. <br /><br /> LEASE TERM: Up to 10 years.

SCOPE:

1.1	The contractor must have all necessary insurance and sufficient employees to perform the contract work.

<DESC>DISCLAIMER
  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. 
Title:  Sources Sought notice for products and services to support the Department of Veterans Affairs enterprise-wide Home Telehealth (HT) Program.

Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research to support the upcoming procurement and update/refine the statement of work to incorporate new commercial technologies and capabilities to better support the HT program.  This RFI encourages potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation substantiating they have products they feel meet the stated requirements.
Requirements Summary:  All items that are specified by the VA in this RFI must be commercially available as telehealth/disease management products.  With respect to care support in the home, the VA seeks contractors to provide home telehealth technologies for use by Veterans together with the requisite data management, support services and information technology services necessary to provide a comprehensive range of HT services.  These home telehealth devices will act as a data access and communication platform that links Veteran patients receiving HT-based care with VA clinicians using a range of telecommunications system options.  These devices and associated systems must support and enable bi-directional transfer of prescribed data, as outlined below, from Veteran patients to VA and vice versa.  In addition to requiring data exchange from the home telehealth devices ("hubs") it purchases, VA also seeks to access similar chronic disease management and patient monitoring data that is secure and encrypted from Veteran patients via their own telephones and suitably compatible mobile devices, such as computers, tablets and/or smart phones.
The Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center (DALC) is requesting responses from qualified business concerns; the qualifying NAICS code for this effort is 339112 "Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing".  The broad requirements listed below should be reviewed in order to accurately respond to this notice.

The Government is also seeking to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications, Service Disabled/Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB/VOSB), HUBZone Program, 8(a), Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman Owned Small Business, or large business (LB) status; relative to NAICS 339112.

Preliminary Review of Product Information:  Responses to this notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  After review of the responses to this notice, a request for proposals will be issued to the government wide point of entry (www.fbo.gov).  Responses to this synopsis are not considered adequate responses to any corresponding solicitation announcement.

Background:

The Home Telehealth technologies used in VA's HT program serve to provide Veteran patients with HT-based services and thereby proactively manage/treat a range of chronic conditions.  VA requires Veteran patients in HT programs to exchange Disease Management Protocol (DMP) information bi-directionally with VA clinicians up to a daily basis, dependent on the patient's treatment plan.  Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) and Broadband IP are the VA's minimum requirements for telecommunications access for exchanging HT data between VA and patients' homes.

Disease Management Protocols (DMPs) are a series of questions, education and information provided to patients that are derived from routine clinical practice meant to replicate aspects of face-to-face assessments.  HT technologies are used to transmit DMPs to patients and receive patient-submitted data in response to DMPs.  DMPs are a critical component of VA's current and future clinical armamentarium to care for veteran patients with chronic diseases and conditions.  All HT technology solutions must be capable of implementing VHA provided DMPs such as, but not limited to, the following diseases or conditions: 

"	Diabetes Mellitus
"	Heart Failure
"	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
"	Hypertension
"	Major Depressive Disorder
"	Weight Management
"	Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

All responses to this RFI shall include the following data:

1.	Please provide a full description and images for any of the following technologies being offered, including functionalities and capabilities.  Include discussion of how data is transmitted from the patient's assigned technology to the vendor server (telephone landline/POTS, cellular, satellite, broadband, Wi-Fi, etc.); and if any technologies have readily available multi-modal transmission capabilities as standard issue.  Types of technologies VA is seeking:
"	A standalone FDA-listed external messaging device (i.e. "Hub", tablet, etc.) and how these transmit data 
"	Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
"	Browser-based applications on the patient's own internet enabled appliances (i.e. home computer, cell phone, handheld devices, tablets, etc.)
"	FDA-listed browser-based applications on a vendor provided home appliance
"	FDA-listed messaging external device with integrated video telemonitoring hardware providing both bi-directional, synchronous telehealth audio/video conferencing and DMP messaging between the patient's home and VA clinicians, with or without associated peripheral measurement devices.
"	Any optional or integrated FDA-approved equipment/accessories, such as peripheral devices/technologies for capture of vital sign measurements, biometric data, and/or images (i.e., peripheral measurement devices), and how these interface with the main hub or technology (direct cable, blue tooth/wireless, etc).  This may include, but is not limited to, the following items:
o	Blood pressure monitor
o	Weight scale
o	Pulse oximeter
o	Blood glucose meter
o	Digital imaging hardware/software for applications such as wound care

2.	Include a discussion of the capability of messaging technologies to be updated remotely with new DMPs, software and/or firmware, thus negating the need for use of any additional peripherals to accomplish this process, and without requiring any involvement from the patient or VA staff.  Also describe any impact to the patient receiving automated/remote upgrades, such as average length of downtime of HT technology and/or utilization of patient's own telephone line during the upgrade process.

3.	Describe the vendor viewer used to display data submitted for individual patients and panels of patients to assigned VA staff, including:

"	The ability of the vendor viewer to provide a summary "dashboard" screen that displays an overview of information for a large panel of patients and automatically indicates to the user which patients on the panel are at high, medium or low health-risk based on parameters established for each individual patient for their DMP responses and vital signs.
"	The ability to set alert parameters based on individual patients, or across patient cohorts meeting certain criteria.
"	The ability to send customized messages to individual patients, or across patient cohorts meeting certain criteria.
"	Various reporting functions that can be used to trend data submitted by patients, identify response/utilization patterns, display different patient groups based on various criteria, etc.
"	Describe processes in place to identify and flag any potentially inaccurate data, such as a weight that shifts 100 pounds in one day, as well as a method to remove and / or annotate inaccurate readings such that they can be reconciled and displayed correctly and do not adversely affect data averages/trending reports.

4.	Provide a listing of current DMPs available, and describe:
"	Process for developing DMPs, including determining clinical safety, effectiveness, patient usability, etc.
"	Ability to combine DMP question sets from two or more diseases/conditions (i.e., co-morbid DMPs); and process for determining clinical safety, usability and appropriateness when this is done.
"	Process for changing DMP content for all patients assigned to a DMP nationally or specific subsets/cohorts based on defined criteria.
"	Ability to make changes without resetting DMP schedule to first day of DMP cycle.
"	Average timeframe to perform changes and upgrades to DMPs.
"	Ability to import DMPs developed by VA for implementation; timeframe needed for implementation of a DMP nationally; and system requirements/format necessary for accepting DMP content directly from VA.
"	Ability to code each question in a DMP and data submitted by patient for transmission to VA as a separate database from the vendor viewer software used for managing patients.

5.	Describe in detail the processes that ensures all patient information submitted is recorded with an accurate date / time stamp (from patient's time zone).  A separate date / time stamp is required for the date and time that the patient took the measurement or image (i.e., data collection date/time) and the date and time when the HT technology transmitted this data to the server (i.e., data transmission date/time).  More specifically, an accurate date /time stamp for both collection and transmission is required for each of the following:
"	The DMP question set; 
"	Each individual vital sign, biometric data point and/or image collected as part of the DMP question set; and 
"	Each individual vital sign, biometric data point and/or image collected separate from the DMP question set. 

Overall, processes should demonstrate how the vendor's technology could be used with utmost confidence of date/time accuracy to safely and efficiently manage large patient panel sizes using alert thresholds so that this data can be accurately documented in the patient's official electronic medical record.  More specifically:
"	Describe how all technologies (hub device, IVR and web-enabled technology, etc.) assigned for patient use meet accurate date / time stamp requirements, including any peripheral measurement devices (blood pressure monitors, blood glucose meters, weight scales, pulse oximeters, etc.,) that would be used by the patient, regardless of the connection type for such peripheral measurement devices (integrated into HT technology, connected via cable, or have wireless transmission capability, entered manually by patient, etc.).
"	Describe the processes used for testing and verifying date/time stamp accuracy for all technologies and peripheral measurement devices that connect to a vendor's system.
"	Describe how battery-operated peripheral measurement devices and devices with individual setting functions or with their own internal processors (e.g., blood glucose meters) are designed to reliably integrate with the HT technology (hub device, IVR and web-enabled technology, etc.) so that an accurate date/time stamp will be provided for each measurement taken, despite any additional programming functions that may be available or used by the patient on that peripheral measurement device.
"	Describe how any data collected and stored in a peripheral measurement device prior to the current HT enrollment would not be transmitted, or would be indicated as such.

6.	Provide product information including product specifications and pricing.

7.	Describe data exchange for management of the programs at a national and local level.  VA types of data reporting include, but are not limited to:  
"	Clinical data (patient identity information, measurements, question responses, surveys, draft progress notes, images, etc.) 
"	Patient Census Data
"	Patient response data
"	Patient Survey data
"	Data for technology inventory
"	Data for device sales and replacement that includes information for each device delivered including model, serial, date delivered, and VA facility
"	Monthly report indicating System overall availability

8.	OMB and VA policy requires federal information systems be continuously monitored to maintain their authorization and reauthorized when there is a significant change to the system.  Examples of situations which may constitute a significant change include: an increase in the sensitivity/criticality of a system; an increase in threat level; policy change, a change in the backup and archiving process, a change in operating system (base platform); a change to security relevant software; a change to hardware that could affect the security architecture; an increase in interconnection with other systems outside the accreditation boundary; or significant changes in the security requirements that apply to the system.

9.	All vendor supplied systems and any associated sub-systems that link into these vendor servers must meet VA specified standards for data exchange, specified metrics of quality/timeliness and fully comply with all necessary VA privacy/cyber security requirements, which may evolve over the life of a contract.  Wherever applicable to VA's cyber security requirements these must all be provided in a secure encrypted environment.  In general, the sources of these policies and requirements include:

This product is proprietary to Waters Technologies Corporation and the company is a sole re-seller of their manufactured software and equipment. Therefore it is critical that the components are purchased from the manufacturer.
These activities have followed a decision based framework and reaching a critical phase where continued collaboration with Waters Technologies Corporation is imperative in order to maintain consistency throughout the Program, and interoffice compatibility. The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase to Politico
Posted Date: January 27th, 2015
Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Headquarters Procurement Operations Division 
Response Date: February 10th, 2015, 5:00pm EST
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Politico. Politico Pro is a subscription service that provides individual customizable access to minute-to-minute news coverage from specialized reporting teams. Politico Pro also develops a set of morning and afternoon newsletters that are delivered via email that provide a summary of the previous day, current day and upcoming day?s news. The subscription also provides access to in-depth coverage of energy/environment focused stories, a calendar of events and an interactive community of community and sector leaders. 
The EPA?s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) is requesting a fifteen-person subscription from Politico Pro. The subscription would give the EPA access to the entire library of Politico?s current and previous articles under seven of the 10 issues areas that Politico covers, including energy, environment, and transportations. OAR issues and topics including power plant regulations, mobile source action and climate related actions are covered heavily in the daily news. As a result, OAR communications and IO staff need to stay abreast of what different sources are saying about our actions. A subscription news service like Politico PRO helps us accomplish this goal by: 1) Providing up-to-the-minute updates on energy and environment related actions 2) Providing commentary that displays multiple opinions from multiple parts of our constituency 3) Providing access to documents and statements by other groups and Congressional offices 4) Providing information about and coverage of events that are taking place outside the agency Together this information better equips OAR communications and IO staff to respond to press inquiries and to have an understanding of public reactions to our actions. 
Politico PRO provides a unique concept and capability by not only providing compelling and informative content, but also delivering it in a way that is accessible and easy to use. While there are many news services out there that cover energy and environment issues, Politico PRO packages them in a way that others do not (e.g., up-to-the-minute email breaking news alerts, minute-by-minute coverage of external EPA events, morning and afternoon newsletters, Capitol Hill coverage). Politico PRO is unique in that it also does not provide too much content and analysis, which many other services provide. It is first and foremost a news agency, not an analytical organization, and as such it provides information in an unbiased and accessible way. We believe the service Politico PRO provides is highly specialized and is not offered, in this format, by any other vendor.
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services satisfy the Agency's requirements. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing.
The point of contact for this requirement is Andrew Howe, Contracting Officer, at howe.andrew@epa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to Standard and Poor's for license subscription to CUSIP data.

<p><br />The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be one (1) year and the total value of the order shall be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>

Name of Proposed Contractor:	bioMerieux Inc.
Street Address:	100 Rodolphe St.
City, State, Zip:	Durham, NC 27712
Phone:	tel: 800-682-2666
email: Kathleen.fitzsimmons@biomerieux.com



Name of Proposed Contractor:	     N/A

Street Address:	     

City, State, Zip:	     

Phone:	     


Description of Supplies or Services:  Vitek 2 60 instrument, as the Minneapolis VA HCS needs to replace the existing Vitek 2 Compact instrument currently in use. 

The estimated value of the proposed action is $         96,292.00


2.	Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

0  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

1  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)) or

0  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)

5.	Rational/explanation to support cited authority: 

The Vitek 2 instrument performs all necessary testing assays needed, is compatible with existing LIS software, and is the only instrument compatible with the bioMerieux mass-spec instrument (which it will connect to, and work in tandem with) also currently owned by the lab. This instrument cost $220,000 to purchase.  The new instrument must be able to perform identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing using the current bioMerieux consumables that are on contract, and be compatible with connecting to the existing mass-spec instrument. The new instrument must also be compatible with the existing LIS software already designed for the Vitek instrumentation. 
No other vendor but bioMerieux with their Vitek 2 instrument performs the identification and susceptibility assays needed, is compatible with existing contracts for consumables, the existing LIS connection, and the mass-spec instrument currently owned by the Minneapolis VA HCS.

6.	BRAND NAME ONLY:  This buy is estimated to exceed $25,000 and this documentation will be posted along with the RFQ on e-Buy, as required by FAR 8.405-6(b)(3).

7.	Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br>  <br> The New Orleans District, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) - Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. <br>   <br> The New Orleans District, US Army Corps of Engineers (CEMVN) has a requirement to purchase Bottomland Hardwood-Wet (BLH-Wet) Mitigation Bank Credits located in the Barataria Basin watershed as specified below, to compensate for unavoidable habitat losses caused by the construction of the West Bank and Vicinity (WBV) Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS). <br> 	 <br> As part of the plan, CEMVN will purchase BLH-Wet mitigation bank credits in the Barataria basin to mitigate BLH-Wet habitat impacts caused by the construction of the WBV HSDRRS.   <br>  <br> Enterprise mitigation bank meets all of the following qualifications to be eligible to sell credits to satisfy WBV HSDRRS mitigation requirements.  For the  proposal to be considered responsive and for the contractor to be considered responsible, the mitigation bank shall:  <br>  	be approved by CEMVN and in full compliance with its Mitigation Banking Instrument (MBI), its other legal instruments (such as its conservation servitude and its financial assurances) and the standards set forth in 33 CFR Part 332;  <br>  	be physically located within the Barataria Basin as defined by the following boundaries:  in Louisiana, south and west of the Mississippi River, north of the Gulf of Mexico and east of Bayou Lafourche <br>  	provide the habitat type that matches the habitat type being mitigated; <br>  	have mitigation credits assessed using version 1.0 of the Wetland Value Assessment (WVA) Community Model available to fully compensate for the impacts to the particular habitat to be mitigated; and <br>  	have a duly-recorded perpetual conservation servitude/easement. <br>  <br> NAICS: 523910. Total value is estimated to cost between $500,000 and $800,000.  The request for proposal will be issued on or about 4 February 2015, with a proposal due date established.  <br>  <br> Enterprise is the only company who has the necessary mitigation bank credits for the USACE New Orleans District to purchase.  Utilization of a different contractor would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement, because other companies would have to go through the approval process which is lengthy and timely. <br>  <br> Parties must be registered in SAM (sam.gov) and may express their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 2 February 2015 by 12:00pm Central Standard Time. Responses should be sent to charles.r.zammit@usace.army.mil and michelle.y.lappen@usace.army.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement; therefore, the initial submission must include adequate information for the Contracting Officer to determine whether the contractor is capable of providing the required services. Additional information will not be requested. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.

(b) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/subcontractor is to perform;
(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and (3) Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph 
(3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR.

h. In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.

The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.

j. The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than __10__ days.

k. When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within _10___ days.

l. All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure.

Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.

Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: Acceptable - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the Offeror's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can reasonably be assigned shall be determined to have unknown past performance and considered  quote mark acceptable quote mark .  <br>  <br> End of 52.212-2 Addendum  <br>  <br> (x) Offerors are encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the System for Award Management website located at URL https://sam.gov/ .

Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). The approved source is Tegam, Inc. (49374). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

The HQAMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or another external forum.  The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.) <BR> <BR>__ (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. __ (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

<DESC>The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a sole-source contract to ChanTest Corporation. The anticipated contract is a logical follow-on to contract HHSF223201310070C for the NicScreen: Constituent Nicotine Receptors project. The NicScreen project is designed to provide information on the pharmacological characterization of cell lines to determine if a compound modulates the activity of particular nicotine receptor subtypes. Contract HHSF223201310070C was to develop five cell lines overexpressing different nicotine receptor subtypes and to test the cell lines with various positive and negative controls in order to determine if the cell lines were functioning. The current contract will be to draft manuscripts based on the scientific data obtained from the work performed under contract HHSF223201310070C and to screen test articles such as tobacco products, individual compounds, and mixture of compounds. Award will be made in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements using Simplified Acquisition Procedures per FAR Part 13.5. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement within seven (7) days after the publication of this synopsis which shall be considered by the agency. Responses received after seven (7) days or without the required information may not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete as a result of information received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Cultural Affairs Tradecraft Course (PY140) within the Public Diplomacy training division trains Cultural Affairs Officers (CAOs) to be effective cultural diplomacy practitioners overseas through an introduction to a broad range of cultural diplomacy tools and guidance on how to use these tools to promote U.S. foreign policy objectives. <br />Students in this three week course will fill overseas positions as cultural affairs officers, assistant cultural affairs officers, public diplomacy officers, public affairs officers or assistant public affairs officers. Other courses at the Foreign Service Institute provide media training geared toward the delivery of foreign policy objectives, and this workshop should not duplicate such training. We are seeking to complement such training with this workshop, to be run by actors in a functioning theatre space, in a way that will teach our students how to deliver a message with poise and confidence.<br />The Foreign Service Institute is therefore seeking proposals from a contractor to design, lead, and host a series of workshops for the Cultural Affairs Officer course entitled "Public Speaking and Presentation Skills for Public Diplomacy Officers" in an appropriate theatre venue. <br />

<p>6. Description of Services: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. For more information on the MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.</p>
<p>The United States of America acting through the Millennium Challenge Corporation ("MCC") has formed partnerships with some of the world's poorest countries through large, five-year Grant Programs referred to as Compacts. MCC administers these Compacts through the Millennium Challenge Accounts (MCAs) which are entities that are set up locally to manage and oversee all aspects of the Compact implementation.</p>
<p>MCC has approved over $7 Billion in Poverty Reduction Compacts worldwide that support country-determined projects in such sectors as:<br />&bull; agriculture and irrigation,<br />&bull; transportation (roads, bridges, ports),<br />&bull; water supply and sanitation,<br />&bull; energy generation, distribution, and transmission<br />&bull; hospitals and clinics,<br />&bull; finance and enterprise development,<br />&bull; anticorruption initiatives,<br />&bull; land rights and access,<br />&bull; schools and universities.</p>
<p>A large part of MCC's portfolio is focused on the infrastructure sector, primarily in roads and building constructions, (Jointly defined as "civil works sector"), using the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (commonly known as FIDIC, acronym for its French name F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale Des Ing&eacute;nieurs-Conseils) based contracts and MCC standard bidding documents for large and small works (see www.mcc.gov).</p>
<p>The Procurement Practice Group, a unit within the Sector Operations Division of MCC's Department of Compact Operations, is committed to supporting MCC's mission by following the highest standards of professional public procurement of goods, services and works necessary for the effective development and implementation of our Compacts. Procurement efforts under the Compacts are conducted by the host country MCA entity using the MCC Program Procurement Guidelines (PPG) and standard bidding documents. The PPG are based on the World Bank procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents but with significant modifications. It is worth noting that MCC Compact-funded procurements are not conducted using the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).</p>
<p>Procurements funded under the Compacts are managed by one or more Procurement Agents (PA) serving the MCA entity. The PA, may be a government entity or a competitively hired private firm, works closely with the MCA entity to ensure that procurements are conducted in compliance with the PPG. MCC provides oversight on the MCA Entity and the PA activities.</p>
<p>For more information on the MCC PPG, please visit www.mcc.gov/pages/business/guidelines.</p>

<SUBJECT>Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS)
<SOLNBR>D15PS00186
<RESPDATE>022415
<ARCHDATE>03112015
<CONTACT>Luke, Kimberly
<DESC>PURPOSE:  The Department of Interior (DOI) Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the DOI Office of Wildland Fire (OWF) [and partners] is seeking to obtain market research from vendors to assist the Government in understanding the capabilities available in the Strategic Software Vehicle industry.  The focus in on continued operations and improvement of Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS).  Additionally, the market research will assist the Government in determining how small business could fit into the acquisition strategy.

The Office of Wildland Fire (OWF), coordinates the DOIs wildland fire program with other Federal (principally USDA Forest Service) and non-federal partners on wildland fire programs, policies, budgets, and information technology enterprise systems and decision support tools.  

BACKGROUND:  OWF [and partners] (more information available at http://www.doi.gov/pmb/owf/index.cfm and http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ ) is working to improve and strengthen the wildland fire program by providing reliable data, authoritative sources, common standards, and integrated systems that support decisions, program direction and policies.

The Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS) is a web-based software and data integration framework that organizes previously existing and newly developed fire and fuels software applications to make fuels treatment planning and analysis more efficient and effective. It is a scalable fuels management planning system that utilizes appropriate fire behavior modeling, economic principles, and information technology to support effective risk-based fuels management planning. (System Architecture Information can be found here: http://www.frames.gov/documents/iftdss/IFTDSS_phaseIV_final_Report.pdf)

IFTDSS provides access to a variety of data and models, all in one place, through one user interface.  IFTDSS provides planners with the structure to pass data (inputs and outputs) easily between models, to reuse and share their work products, and provides a consistent analysis framework for all users.

The Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) sponsored the design, prototype, early development, and evaluation of IFTDSS beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2013.  JFSP worked closely with fuels managers throughout that time period garnering feedback to ensure that IFTDSS was focused on user needs and priorities.  These efforts were recently acknowledged when the Wildland Fire Information and Technology (WFIT) Executive Board formally approved IFTDSS on May 30, 2014 for further development and eventual operational deployment.  IFTDSS version 2.0 Beta is currently available and will be managed in beta test mode for the next two years, with full operational deployment planned for 2017 (Background information on the history of the project can be found here: http://www.frames.gov/partner-sites/iftdss/iftdss-home )

Extensive guidance from a broad range of fuels treatment specialists over the last five years has resulted in the identification of four critically important workflow processes: 

1.Hazard Analysis 
2.Risk Assessment 
3.Fuels Treatment Assessment
4.Prescribed Burn Planning 

Business Need
Fire Manager Challenges 
Unlike wildfire response and preparedness, fuels treatment management and planning across the federal fire agencies does not have a common approach. The dis-integrated tasks that fire managers are asked to complete in order to plan and implement fuels treatments do not currently stem from a programmatically stated business requirements. The business need for implementing a Fuels Management Decision Support System is based on the following four challenges facing fire managers: 

1.No existing widely accepted risk management-based fuel treatment decision support process
2.No Interagency archive database for fuels management planning or implementation activities
3.Fire managers and planners are not trained to a) complete landscape or unit level risk-based assessments or b) plan for effective fuels treatments 
4.Fuels treatment planning data and information is not aligned with wildfire response decision support tools or information

The implementation and development of IFTDSS will address and meet each of these fire management challenges:

-IFTDSS will provide a consistent end-to-end risked based fuels treatment planning process that can be used across the fire management and fuels planning community
-IFTDSS will support an enterprise architecture to be paradigm characterized by an emphasis on risk management; standards, predictable processes; shared data & outcomes across a broad community
-IFTDSS will allow the use of authoritative data/systems; integrated tools; focused planning & support; integral training; and shared knowledge

NOTICE:  This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the Government will not reimburse for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.

Sources Sought:  This RFI is seeking responses from vendors to address the questions below.  OWF is looking for a Software Strategic Source for the IFTDSS web applications environment which will provide users with an interface to workflows supporting fuels treatment decision support actions that use existing (and future) fire and fuels software applications and scientific models to make fuels treatment planning and analysis more efficient and effective.  This web-based application is tied to a Scientific Modeling Framework (SMF) where approved models and databases are housed allowing access by users. The Scientific Modeling Framework is designed to allow researchers and developers to test existing models within the SMF but also to develop new fire management related models, tools and applications in a playground environment.  Links to source documentation are provided throughout this RFI.  Additionally, OWF is seeking information pertaining to the questions identified below. 

Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered.  Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.

Government Questions: 
1. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a single source vs. multiple sources for development of the described IFTDSS application? Would a single source be capable of providing the support for all of the vision/extent identified for IFTDSS in the provided links?
2. IFTDSS is intended to be a secure web-based application available to multiple federal agencies, as well as state and private users.  We anticipate at least 3 levels of access (Administrative, National/Regional, and local) and intend for users from disparate agencies (Structured with a username/password unique to IFTDSS) to be able to collaborate online on specific projects. 
a. Have you developed a web based system which adheres to federal IT security standards and requirements? If so, please describe and provide the list of efforts. 
b.Describe the general approach you would take, citing functional existing examples, to ensure access for a variety of classes of users.
3. IFTDSS is designed as a software integration framework that organizes and integrates different models and data sets used in fire and fuels planning giving direct access to multiple individual software tools and models through and single web-based interface. The current software integration framework for IFTDSS, known as the Scientific Modelling Framework (SMF), has been independently developed over the past 5 years as part of the broader IFTDSS application development.  
a. Have you developed and implemented other integration systems (linking and/or incorporating other systems and models)? If so, please provide the list as well as the points of contact for each.
b. Would you recommend continued development of the existing SMF as IFTDSS moves forward or development/ incorporation/conversion to a more current service oriented architecture package?  Briefly explain your logic.
4. Integration of future, current, and legacy data sets and the ability to push and pull data is a key functionality desire within IFTDSS.  
a. Federal Wildland Fire Management has several data systems [Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS), LANDFIRE, National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS), etc.] and models (BehavePlus, FlamMap, FARSITE, FOFEM, NEXUS, etc.) from which IFTDSS could push and pull data and analyses.  From the contract material provided, how would you envision that this data integration and system interoperability be implemented in IFTDSS?  
b. How would you describe this issue to potential developers in order for them to evaluate and understand the nature of the work (business terminology, requirements, etc.) of legacy dataset integration being advertised?
c. Federal Fire Management Systems are just beginning to explore more seamless integration between systems. There are many opportunities for utilizing cloud services and testing better technologies to assist with info sharing that reducing redundant data entry requirements and presents end users with the latest and most accurate information.  As legacy systems merge, split and evolve over time, developers will need to be flexible in regards to how data is shared.  IFTDSS will require its own unique native database, will pull vital inputs and information from other established systems and will push outputs to external systems of record.  Do you have examples from other work with the federal, state, or municipal government or the private sector where the contract and scope of work were able to successfully define this dynamic environment?  If so, please describe the scope or provide example language.  
5. Most of the source code for federal wildland fire management applications is dynamic, evolving and changing (fire behavior models in particular). Software is written in different coding or software languages, legacy software or code was built on the fly and can be expansive and difficult to break into simple stand-alone code blocks that can be quickly plugged into new systems.  The SMF is one attempt to build some agility into the coding work, and efforts are underway to run the most utilized models on a single cloud server.  In the meantime, legacy code may have to be integrated into native applications.  
a. Do you have experience with prior projects which required understanding of the domain business logic and necessitated flexibility in making efficient changes as the system evolved? If yes, please describe.
b. How would you describe this issue to potential developers in order for them to evaluate and understand the nature of the work (business terminology, requirements, etc.) of legacy dataset integration being advertised?
6. What is the typical pricing structure for the Industry?
7. Describe the challenges you see in this project both in terms of technical challenges and in terms of the dynamic nature of government policies and priorities.  
8. OWF is considering a Best value/Trade-off approach for this.  If this requirement becomes a formal solicitation, what should OWF consider when trying to determine what is the best proposal including the evaluation factors?  Please explain the recommendations.  The following are several examples, but firms are encouraged to elaborate further by commenting on the value of the factors being considered, suggest others, or recommend eliminating.
-Key Personnel
-Past Performance
-Percentage of items Vendor can support
-Management Plan / Project Management
-Implementation Plan
-Technical Approach
9. If OWF decides to conduct oral presentations as part of the source selection process, what do firms believe is an effective way of evaluating offers during oral presentations?
-A software or website demonstration.
-A scenario provided with the solicitation and having firms brief the solution.
-Or describe another approach

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) TBD is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) 

(a) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: 

1. Price: The quoters price quote will be evaluated to determine if it is reasonable and consistent with the proposed technical approach for the base. Unrealistically low (or high) proposed price determined to be unbalanced may be grounds for eliminating the quote from competition on the basis that the quoter does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic quote.

The initial proposal submitted must contain adequate information to ascertain the contractors ability to comply with all requirements of the solicitation and should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. 
 
All proposals SHALL be submitted electronically to linda.lamoreux@usmc.mil may be hand carried or delivered to:

For proposals delivered by hand, offerors are advised that entry to the installation is restricted, and offerors are directed to familiarize themselves with the entry control location and process.
 Entry processing time is unpredictable and can be lengthy. The addressee indicated above may be able to facilitate entry processing, but is not required to do so, and inability to gain access shall not excuse late delivery. 
If proposals are submitted in different formats requiring different delivery methods, the proposal of record shall be the last complete version received prior to the deadline. 
For email proposals, the Government office designated for receipt of the proposal is the email inbox of the addressee indicated above. Notwithstanding the provisions at FAR 52.212-1(c) or FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), delivery is not accomplished until the addressee can open the email; delivery to a server or an email inbox on a server is not considered delivery to the designated Government office and the quotation is not under the Governments control until the addressee can open the email.
 The email shall not be considered to be delivered unless the entire content of the email and all attachments can be read by the addressee indicated above. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from the addressee establishes that a record was received but does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received. Email attachments are limited to no more than 2MB. Offerors are specifically warned that email may be subjected to spam filters or attachment stripping. 
All transmissions must clearly state the solicitation number and the name of the contracting specialist on the first page to ensure proper receipt.

29P0022

     MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  The contractor shall comply with all current access procedures throughout all performance periods under this contract, and changes to these procedures shall not constitute grounds for contractor claims or request for equitable adjustment.  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.
  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid drivers license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.
  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employees citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.
  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.
  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.
  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.
  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.
 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation (paper copy) will not be issued. Further, offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of amendments (if any) or other information pertaining to this solicitation.
<p>Solicitation FA8751-15-R-0001 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 20141216. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Total Small Business set-aside under NAICS code 334111 and size standard of 1,000 employees. However the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name but which proposes to furnish an item which it does not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government requires a turn-key high performance computing&nbsp;solution to be delivered and installed by the contract awardee. The parts items and required performance characteristics detailed in the requirements document ATTACHMENT 1, dated 07 JAN 2015, represent a technical solution that is known to fulfill the Government's requirement. Although the list of materials is based on Rittal and Hewlett-Packard products, offerors will be able to propose "brand name or equal" products (reference FAR 52.211-6). Proposals which include alternatives to the products identified in the description must be accompanied by technical documentation in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate compliance with the performance characteristics of this known solution (reference FAR 52.212-1(b)(4)). The required performance characteristics reflect the minimum salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that reflect the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs.</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide all items (or equal) on a Firm Fixed Price basis, including the cost of shipping FOB Destination and shall provide at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.</p>
<p>The anticipated date the contractor is expected to execute initial system start-up and commission for Government inspection is 70 days after contract award. All deliveries shall be made in accordance with FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination (Nov 1991). The place of delivery, acceptance and FOB destination point is Monterey, CA</p>
<p>SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENT<br /><br />POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p>
<p>(a) There is potential organizational conflict of interest (see FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest) due to the fact that performance of the contract involves access to information technology networks, servers and computers via higher level privileges; therefore it is assumed that any data on these networks, servers and computers could potentially be accessed by the contractor. Additionally, equipment procured under this solicitation will be inserted into a high performance computing competition. To preserve competition integrity and check the flow of information, employees, subcontractors, or affiliates of offerors may not participate in a capacity outside that of equipment supplier for the competition infrastructure. Further, the contractor is expected to agree to a non-disclosure agreement that protects disclosure or improper use of each competitor's proprietary data at any time during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(1) The following restrictions apply:</p>
<p>(i) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the contracting officer may (A) disqualify the offeror, or (B) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate clause to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the contracting officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated, or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br /><br />(ii) Each offeror is required to represent, as part of its proposal and to the best of its knowledge that: (A) it is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract; or (B) it has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included the mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iii), Mitigation/Waiver, below.<br /><br />(iii) Mitigation/Waiver. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes it can be mitigated, neutralized, or avoided, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the contracting officer for review. At a minimum the offeror should state as a mitigation plan their intent, upon contract award, to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement with each competitor entity. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before government approval of the mitigation plan.<br /><br />(iv) Other Relevant Information. In addition to the mitigation plan, the contracting officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The contracting officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to the Government, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br /><br />(v) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the contracting officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br /><br />(vi) Flow-down. The successful offeror shall insert the substance of the Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in each subcontract tier.</p>
<p>(2) As part of the proposal, the offeror shall provide the contracting officer with complete information of previous or ongoing work that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition.</p>
<p>(b) If award is made to the offeror, the resulting contract may include an organizational conflict of interest limitation applicable to subsequent government work, at either a prime contract level, at any subcontract tier, or both. During evaluation of proposals, the Government may, after discussions with the offeror and consideration of ways to avoid the conflict of interest, insert a special provision in the resulting contract which shall disqualify the offeror from further consideration for award of future contracts.<br /><br />(c) The organizational conflict of interest clause included in this solicitation may be modified or deleted during negotiations.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (APR 2014), applies to this acquisition. Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are:</p>
<p>(b) Written proposals are due at or before 3 PM (ET)&nbsp;29 January 2015. Submit by email to richard.childres@us.af.mil or by mail to AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Richard Childres, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514, or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555. Offerors are encouraged to submit their proposals/quotes using the SF 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items.<br /><br />(b)(4) Submit a technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate the capability of the solution being offered. Include product literature and other documentation necessary to (i) demonstrate compliance with the specifications, and (ii) verify authenticity of the products being offered and the sourcing method to be used.</p>
<p>(b)(10) Submit past performance information for contracts completed within the previous 3 years for efforts relevant in terms of scope and magnitude to this requirement. Please include contract/project numbers, current points of contact with telephone numbers and email, a brief contract/project description, and any other relevant information.</p>
<p>(b)(11) Include a statement verifying that your firm is capable of conforming to the requirements of DFARS clause 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation.</p>
<p>(b)(12) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(k) System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors must be registered in the SAM database to receive a contract award. If the Offeror does not become registered in the SAM database within 4 days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>EVALUATION</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014) applies. In addition to the information within Paragraph (a), the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Price, (ii) Technical Acceptability, and (iii) Past Performance. When combined, technical acceptability and past performance are approximately equal in importance to price. The Government intends to award a contract to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror with acceptable past performance.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to complete representations and certifications found in the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (DEC 2014); Alternate I (OCT 2014). <br /><br />The offeror is required to complete representations and certifications found in the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Dec 2014), ALT I (Oct 2014), paragraph (b), and at DFARS 252.209-7992 Representation By Corporations Regarding An Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability Or A Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law - Fiscal Year 2015 Appropriations (Deviation 2015-OO0005) (DEC 2014).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product 	Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ 	___________________ <br />___________________ 	___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

Mandatory Electronic Invoicing 
VA published the final rule requiring vendors to submit invoices electronically to the Financial Services Center (FSC) in the November 27, 2012 Federal Register.  The rule became effective December 27, 2012.  The rule includes a new contract clause to be inserted in all solicitations and contracts by the contracting officer (VAAR 852.232-72).  Vendors can comply with the rule by using either of the two methods below:
1.        The FSC uses a third-party contractor, OB10, to transition vendors from paper to electronic invoice submission.  For information on OB10 electronic invoicing set-up, vendors should call 877-752-0900, or email USClientServices@ob10.com .
2.        A system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) format established by the Accredited Standards Center.  For FSC e-Invoicing information, please call 877-353-9791 or email vafsccshd@va.gov.
FSC and VA's Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) will assist existing commercial vendors in migrating to the electronic process.  Until the transition to electronic format is complete, FSC will continue to process paper invoices for commercial vendors. 
The FSC's electronic invoicing system provides a variety of flexible solutions for all vendor types, including small businesses, and does not require any vendor transaction fees.  More information on the FSC electronic invoicing process can be found at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.Contracting Office Address:

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Alexandre Augusto Guedes Guimar&atilde;es <br />PRODAM<br />Rua Jonathas Pedrosa, 1937 - Pra&ccedil;a 14 de Janeiro<br />Manaus, AM 69020-110<br />Brazil<br />Tel: +55 (92) 6405/09/6415 3303-0437<br /><br />
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study and develop preliminary designs and implementation requirements for the construction of a data center for the State of Amazonas in Brazil (the "host  country").</p>
<p>The Centro de Processamento de Dados do Estado de Amazonas ("PRODAM") is a private corporation with controlling interest owned by the State of Amazonas, and is linked administratively with the Secretariat for Planning and Economic Development (SEPLAN).  PRODAM has been in operation since 1972, providing specialized information technology services to government entities at municipal, state and federal levels, as well as to some private companies.  In its forty years of operation, PRODAM has continually sought to improve and refine its management processes and standards according to its guiding values of competence, credibility and a pioneering spirit.</p>
<p>PRODAM seeks to build on its successes in applying information technology for public administration and to continue to expand the state's capabilities in this area.  One central investment in the PRODAM strategy will be a new government data center that will host public sector applications, facilitate management of government networks, and serve backup and disaster recovery functions for data and applications maintained by disparate government agencies.  The fundamental design requirements for the data center will be determined by projections of the expected useful life of the infrastructure, the desired future capabilities of the state, and planning for contingencies.  As a result, effective planning for the data center will be rooted in the over-arching strategy of Amazonas state, the strategies of disparate Amazonas state agencies, and best efforts to predict future scenarios for the state and technology evolution.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $578,995 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit one copy of the Proposal in English and Portuguese, as well as an electronic copy of each proposal on a flash drive, directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4pm local time, February 15, 2015</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV.  If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov), or any other 3rd party provider, attachments may not be available or viewable to you.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, OK, has an ongoing requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The support is predominantly hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be primarily based at the MMAC, Oklahoma City, OK.   The current contracts statement of work (SOW) is provided as an attachment to this market survey to inform and assist interested vendors of the technical work required.  However, interested respondents are cautioned that the Government at its discretion may update and or revise this SOW prior to the close of the current contract and for any potential follow on contract.

At this time, the acquisition strategy and nature of competition has not been determined for any potential follow on contract. The Government welcomes statements of interest and capabilities from all small businesses, including service-disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small businesses, and 8(a) certified firms, which are capable of providing the required items and services.  However, contract performance has historically been set aside and achieved by fully certified 8(a) businesses.  It is the Governments intent to sustain the 8(a) set aside should results of this survey conclude that it is appropriate to do so.  Depending on responses to this survey and analysis of market research collected, the Government may, at its discretion, decide to pursue a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR OFFERS.  A SIR/Request for Offer may be made under a separate announcement in the future.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing vendor responses to this market survey. Therefore any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense. 

The Government has a strong desire to hear from prime contractors who can show they have the capacity to perform 100% of the work requirement, without sub-contracting or teaming with other contractors, for the contemplated follow on award for these services.  If interested contractors cant show capacity to perform 100% of the work requirement as the prime, it is requested that they respond with a percentage that represents what their total performance capacity is to complete the work as the prime or what they would suggest as a prime  to  sub percentage break down.  Aside from the Governments preference, interested respondents to this market survey are still required to show how the prime can meet the requirements of the Limitations in Subcontracts as defined in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitations on Subcontracting.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons) with a size standard of $38.5 million.     
 
The purpose of this announcement is to conduct a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors, in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1.  This market survey will enable the FAA to review responses that are current and will assist with acquisition planning based on current data.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  
HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS MARKET SURVEY:  Interested vendors should submit the items listed below to the point of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.

1.  Capability Statement. This document is limited to not more than five (5) pages and must include a brief description of the engineering, computer, and administrative services provided by your firm which are same/similar to those services outlined in this market survey and similar/same to the current contracts statement of work attached at the bottom of this survey.

2.  Performance Capacity.  Respondents must provide an indication of the percentage of work that can be performed by the prime contractor.  If the prime is not capable of performing 100% of the work requirement respondents need to show what their percentage capacity is to perform the work as a prime/sub arrangement.

3.  Business Declaration Form  Interested vendors must complete the attached Business Declaration Form and submit with their Capability Statement.  If applicable, a copy of the vendors SBA 8(a) Certification Letter is required.

Responses to this market survey must be received by close of business February 23, 2015.  Submissions should be sent via email to the following point of contact:

<DESC>***Amendment*** The purpose of this amendment is to change the solicitation posting date to 2/20/2014.  The full solicitation will be posted to FedConnect.net.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, requires a complete test system for performing mid-range engine testing. These test systems will produce data of highest precision and accuracy with a high level of certainty, in a manner that can be comprehensively demonstrated and documented.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to Full and Open Competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.
EPA seeks a test cell that will be used for engine compliance testing to support EPA's compliance activities.  The engines to be tested are primarily nonroad diesel engine applications, and are used in agriculture equipment, construction equipment, and generators in the 30 to 150 kW range.  These engines are regulated under 40 CFR, part 1039, Control of Emissions from New and In-Use Nonroad Compression - Ignition Engines.  Part 1039 requires the use of 40 CFR, part 1065 for the testing procedures.  The test site will be designed for engines meeting the Nonroad Tier 4 emissions standards.  The primary usage of the test cell will be for nonroad engines, however, 2010 or later on-highway engines could also be tested.
This requirement is for a complete integrated engine test cell.  There are seven major systems included in this procurement: 1. Automation System; 2. Engine Dynamometers; 3. Emission Sampler, CVS and PM measurement; 4. Analytical Systems; 5. Intake Air Measurement; 6. Fuel System (Option); 7. Cooling Systems (Option).
The contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 17025 standards. 		 Award will be made on a Best Value Basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant previous experience.   
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Gerold Young, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2660, or by email at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via email.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

The aim of the modular structure is to improve the operational capacity of the Customs Service at the crossing point located in Kizil Art. <br /> <br />Kizil Art is a border crossing point between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the Pamir mountain Range and is at an elevation of 4,280 meters. The remote location and high elevation allows for a very short construction period to perform any work.  Nine months out of each year, the ground is frozen. <br /><br />The modular structure is to be a two-story office/barracks design.  The Government requires a complete design package to also include shop drawings, and a construction schedule.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUIREMENT AND SCOPE</span></strong><br />1.

<DESC>This amended synopsis supersedes the action published on 12 September 2014, and satisfies the requirement at FAR Part 5.2 and constitutes the Government's Notice of Intent to increase the ceiling and extend the ordering period of Contract Number W900KK-09-D-0006 on a non-competitive basis. The action will be accomplished per 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A)-Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  <br>  <br> The Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI) intends to increase the ceiling and extend the term of the current single award ID/IQ contract W900KK-09-D-0006 with ECS Federal, Inc. (ECS) 2750 Prosperity Ave Suite 100, Fairfax, VA 22031-4312, on a sole source basis in support of the System Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA) program. The estimated amount of the ceiling increase is $68,100,000.00, from $270,570,046.00 to $338,670,046.00. The contract ordering period will be extended by 18 months via one 12 month option and one 6 month option.  PEO STRI does not anticipate that a competitive action would recover the substantial duplication of costs associated with a short-term contract while the follow-on contract is competed and awarded. This proposed action is a bridging strategy, enabling the current competitive action to continue as planned, with anticipated award taking place in the 4th quarter of FY16.   The work to be performed with the ceiling increase and contract extension are within scope of the contract, and includes the following:  <br>  <br> 1) Acquisition Planning and Support,  <br> 2) Administrative Support,  <br> 3) Agency Coordination Support,  <br> 4) Audio-Visual and Graphics Support,  <br> 5) Customer Coordination Support,  <br> 6) Facilities Support,  <br> 7) Financial Management Support,  <br> 8) Information System and Software Operations Support,  <br> 9) Integrated Logistics Support,  <br> 10) Military and Organizations Studies, Analysis and Assessment Support,  <br> 11) Program Analyses, Evaluations and Assessment Support,  <br> 12) Program Execution and Oversight Support,  <br> 13) Property and Supply Support,  <br> 14) Public Affairs and Events Support,  <br> 15) Security and Visitor Control Support,  <br> 16) System and Software Engineering Support,  <br> 17) Technology Analysis, Evaluations and Assessment Support, and  <br> 18) Test and Training Operational Support  <br>  <br> Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this action would not result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government for the startup, hiring, training and execution of the above support services over an estimated 12-18 month period while the follow-on contract is competed and awarded. In doing so, interested sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quote, outlining pricing information, information showing how the government can recover the anticipated substantial duplication of costs through a short-term competitive action, and demonstrating the ability to meet the Government's needs. Responses must be received no later than the 15th day after this notice is posted. The above described capability statements, quotes or proposals must be submitted to PEO STRI Contracting Center; ATTN: KOP - David Bremer; 12350 Research Parkway; Orlando, FL 32826. This synopsis is not considered a request for bid, quote or proposal. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests for technical information will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of capability statements, quotes or proposals received in response to this notice, but responses, if any, will be used to determine if a short term competitive action would eliminate any substantial duplication of costs. <br>

<DESC>NOTICE TO ALL FIRMS RESPONDING TO PHASE I - RFQ<br /><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) is nearly complete with the review of Phase I submissions under this RFQ. GSA received an overwhelming response from the Small Business community under this RFQ. It has been a tedious task and has taken the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and its advisors a tremendous amount of time and effort to evaluate each aspect of the submissions received. As stated in the RFQ:
<p>In Phase One, GSA will select a short list of the most highly qualified offerors and request that those offerors submit Phase Two proposals..... A maximum of fifteen (15) firms will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals. Only those selected offerors are authorized to submit Phase Two proposals. Those offerors not selected for participation in Phase Two will be notified.</p>
<p>At this stage in the process, the final report of the SSEB is being prepared for circulation for appropriate concurrences and signatures. Once all concurrences and signatures have been received, an announcement at FedBizOpps can be made shortlisting the "maximum fifteen (15) firms" invited for Phase Two.</p>

The A-E must demonstrate its and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance and are equal among themselves; Criterion (7) is the least important and will be used as a tie breaker among technically equal firms; and Criterion (8) will exclude a firm from further evaluation. Specific evaluation criteria include:

	2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
	3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
	4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost 	control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.

Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.

Criterion 3 - Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms/teams will be evaluated in terms of their ability to plan for and manage work under the contract and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm's ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm's capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance - Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. NOTE: Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1 will be given greater weight.

Submission requirements: SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment (A)) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE. IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF-330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) as long as it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 19, Attn: Rachel Beason via email at rachel.beason@va.gov prior to the response date.

<DESC>Questions and Answers RFP VA259-15-R-0093 (Fire Alarm System)

1.  Question:  Submission Requirements (1) states that the A/E must include a registered engineer from the State of Wyoming.  Please clarify is this is truly required as typical VA and Government contracts simply require the engineer to be registered in any state in the US.
      Answer:  The A/E must include a registered engineer from the State of Wyoming.  The Government shall allow an offeror to demonstrate reciprocity through National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES). 

2.  Question:  What qualifications do you require of the 3rd party reviewer?  (NICET IV, PE, PE in WY, 10+ years' experience)
      Answer:  NICET IV certified with experience shown in SF 330 or a licensed fire protection engineer

3.  Question:  If the A/E is to provide the 3rd party reviewer, can the reviewer be an employee of the A/E firm provided they meet the qualifications and have no design responsibility?
Answer:  No, must be 3rd party

4.  Question:  The scope of work calls for the A/E to perform an inspection above ceilings and in attics.  Are there any areas above ceilings or in attics containing asbestos or other materials that would make an inspection hazardous?
      Answer:  The Government has minimal asbestos left on site. The Government will provide the awarded team a copy of the latest asbestos survey after the award.

5.  Question:  Section I.8 (h) states to schedule 4 trips for the inspection. What is the anticipated duration of each trip?
      Answer:  Allowable trips for this project are 4 trips. Anticipated duration of each trip is dependent on the successful offeror.

6.  Question:  Section I.2 (b) states the A/E is responsible for testing the existing wire for "defects".  Please clarify the anticipated method for this testing.  If something similar to megger testing is required, that would mean that all devices would need to be removed from the wire and the wiring temporarily spliced together.  Is this level of testing anticipated?  If so, it would be extremely time consuming and require a complete functional test of all devices once reinstalled per NFPA 72. 
Answer:  Section 1 part 3 states that devices will not be replaced but must be able to connect to the panels.  Since the wiring are 5 to 30 years old, the engineer shall do which ever testing they deem necessary.  When upon completion of the design, the system shall fully work.  

7.  Question:  Section I.2 implies only replacing head-end equipment, sub-panels and the associated interconnection but all devices are to remain as existing. Is this correct or is the intent to design to the fullest extent of available funds, including device replacement?
      Answer:  Yes.

8.  Question:  Can you provide the weighting of each of the criterion used for selection?  For example, is Criterion 5 more important than Criterion 6 or are they of equal importance?
      Answer: The criteria are listed in descending order of importance, as stated in the pre-solicitation.

9.  Question:  Criterion 1 states to indicate whether or not key personnel hold any security clearance.  Is there a requirement for a security clearance for this project?  If key personnel do not have any security clearance, will that rank them lower than key personnel who have a security clearance?
      Answer: Please see revised Evaluation Criteria. Security clearance is no longer part of the evaluation factor.

10.  Question:  Criterion 1 states to provide "licensed and or certified workforce infire systems design/installation".  Since this project does not include installation work, please clarify why an installation certification is being requested?  If an installation certification is being requested, please clarify what is meant by this, i.e. low voltage contractor, NICET certification, etc.
       Answer: The requirement of the design/installation subject matter expert is for the inspection of the installation during the Construction period services portion of the A/E service.

11.  Question:  Criterion 7 requires submission of "documentation or certificates as evidence of reputation and standing of its firm".  Please clarify or provide an example of what documentation or certificates would meet this criterion.  (Same as question #16)
        Answer:  Specific achievements of your firm, such as publications, awards, certificates, or commendations from within the community that show you are a firm in good standing.

12.  Question:  Submission requirements:  Is there a limit on the number of pages that can be included within the pdf?
         Answer:  There is a limit of 40 pages for these (SF 330 Part I, Sections A-H). The page limit does not pertain to the PPQ's.

13.  Question:  Criterion 2, Submission requirements - I see you are only requesting five projects for Section F, not 10. Is this correct?
        Answer:  Yes

14.  Question:  Criterion 4, Submission requirements - you are requiring either a CPARS/ACASS evaluation OR a Past Performance Questionnaire to be completed on each one of the five projects we are submitting in Section F. Is this correct?
         Answer:  Yes

15.   Question:  Criterion 5, Submission requirements - you state - Offerors shall submit evidence of individuals' experience and qualifications in their respective fields. Additionally, documentation must be provided to show these individuals have worked together as a team on previous.. What is the documentation that you are requiring? I am not sure what this is.
        Answer:  Completing Sections E, F, and G on the SF330 will complete the documentation requirement to show these individuals have worked together as a team and their role.

16.  Question:  Criterion 7, Submission requirements - you state - Offerors shall provide documentation or certificates as evidence of reputation and standing of it firm. What is the documentation or certificates that you are requiring? Again I am not sure what this is.
        Answer:  Specific achievements of your firm, such as publications, awards, certificates, or commendations from within the community that show you are a firm in good standing.

17.  Question:  The specification says the brand of the system only matters in that they need to be able to get service in a matter of hours and not days.  Can manufacturers of different brands be approved to bid the project if the requirements to provide building protection during construction can be met by the fire alarm contractor?
        Answer:  This project is for design only at this point. 

18.  Question:  Is there an existing alarm receiving computer or central monitoring software/computer setup on site at the VA hospital, and if so would it be acceptable to replace or upgrade the monitoring software/computer as needed to work with the new fire alarm system brand?
        Answer:  See Sections 1part2a and section 1 part 4 from the SOW

19.  Question:  What I am trying to find out is if vendors of various brands of fire alarm system are going to be allowed to bid the project when the engineering design is complete (dependent upon Engineer's approval).  If the VA is already tied to one brand, i.e. EST, Notifier, Advancedthen the final project will only be bid by a single contractor.  However, if it's the intent of the VA to upgrade their buildings to have a single brand in all buildings, but they do not care what brand that is as long as it's approved by the engineer then different fire alarm suppliers will be able to bid it.
        Answer:  In the provided specs/drawings used in procuring construction services, the Government shall state there shall be Brand name or equal that meets the plans and specs. 

20.  Question:  In the PDF, page 5 of 14 - Section VI Part 2 Calculations - it asks for heating and cooling calculations.  Calculations for the fire alarm systems are normally provided by the fire alarm contractor (i.e. voltage drop calculations, battery calculations, circuit power calculations, etc.) - these are not normally provided by the engineer as they are manufacturer dependent.  Should the fire protection engineer (PE) expect to provide these services under this contract or should we be permitted to allow the contractor to provide these calculations under their Shop Drawing Submission?
        Answer:  Any calculations the engineer performs which will prove in the future (i.e. 5 years down the road if something breaks and the Government need to get it fixed) why the design was performed in a certain manner, will be provided at the time of the design.  Any manufacture calculations relevant to the design will be reviewed by the engineer during the construction submittal phase and will be recorded for future use also.

21.  Question:  How many buildings will have a fire alarm system replacement?  Of those buildings, what are the numbers/names and what are the approximate areas and number of floors for each building?
        Answer:  Section 1part2 states 23 buildings. A summary of the campus is an average of 3 floors (including basement) and attic per building, average 1 panel per building a couple have 2 and ranging from 1,500 SF to 12,000 SF per floor. Plans in AutoCAD will be provided as stated in section 10 after award. These buildings are spread out on a 250 acres parcel of land.  There are conduits between most of them but it is not direct paths. See map below showing the 23 buildings.

 

22. Question: The Construction Administration seems very low - I would recommend weekly site visits initially and then taper to bi-weekly or monthly site visits to ensure progress by the contractor and proper installation?  Would these services be negotiated after selection? 
        Answer:  Construction period services will be negotiated with top offeror after evaluation of SF 330's. During negotiations, the Government shall address the amount of site visits and inspections with offeror.

b.	Size:  Maximum size of the e-mail message shall not exceed five (5) megabytes.  Only one email is permitted unless otherwise stated in this paragraph or in writing by the Contract Officer submitting the solicitation.
The offer will be date and time stamped by the Microsoft Email system and will be the official record of receipt for the submission.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
1.	Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f), 52.214-7, and 52.215-1(c)(3).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission. 
 
2.	Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
  
3.	To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as "unreadable" pursuant to FAR Parts 14.406 and FAR 15.207(c ). 

4.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

5.	Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.

Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-compliant. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.
