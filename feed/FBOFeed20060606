<SUBJECT>B--Beaufort Sea Marine Fish Monitoring: Pilot Survey and Test of Hypotheses
<SOLNBR>0106AN39770
<RESPDATE>062306
<ARCHDATE>06062007
<CONTACT>Kimberly Luke Contract Specialist 7037871339     kimberly.luke@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to conduct the study "Beaufort Sea Marine Fish Monitoring: Pilot Survey and Test of Hypotheses."  This requirement is being issued in accordance with FAR 15.202.  PURPOSE: This study would implement a marine fish survey in the Beaufort Sea Outer Continental Shelf Planning Area that will test hypotheses used in the evaluation of the potential effects of offshore development. BACKGROUND: MMS needs information to assess and manage the potential environmental effects of offshore development on marine fish in the Beaufort Sea.  The geographic area within the Beaufort Sea OCS Planning Area (three miles or more beyond the coast) encompasses primarily the shallow continental shelf which averages 50 meters in depth.  Fisheries information is used in NEPA analysis of lease sales, exploration plans, and development and production plans.  These analyses are presented in NEPA documents that evaluate exploration through development and production activities, including analysis of possible oilspills.  The primary potential effects on fish that MMS analysts commonly evaluate in these NEPA documents are the effects 1) within the water column (e.g. from an unlikely but potentially wide spread oilspill or from seismic exploration), and 2) in benthic (e.g. from building and operating subsea pipelines) habitats.  In the Beaufort Sea, little is known about the biology and ecology of many marine fish species inhabiting the area.  The MMS highest priority information needs are: 1) species presence; 2) distribution; 3) abundance. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   SCOPE OF WORK: Task 1: Review of Existing Knowledge.  In Task 1, the contractor shall identify and review (a) historical marine fish surveys in the Beaufort Sea OCS, (b) species, methods, and data collected by those surveys; and (c) relevant primary data from those surveys that can be compared to his survey's results.  Task 2: Field Implementation.  Task 2 includes (a) target four species representative of Beaufort Sea species, habitats and offshore development issues; (b)deploy active in-situ trawl gear of a variety of types as a primary sampling method; (c)collect concurrent physical, chemical, biological and other environmental data necessary to evaluate and test the significance of other independent variables that potentially affect the dependent variables of the null hypotheses; (d) expand beyond the ice season; (e) collect and process archival biological samples.  Task 3: Survey Logistics.  In Task 3, the contractor must implement the survey field logistics, including the following four components: (a) provide the survey vessels, personnel, equipment, and other facilities on a schedule that will achieve seasonal survey coverage; (for a list of MMS equipment likely to be available, visit: www.mms.gov/alaska/ess/index.htm) (b) coordinate with other ongoing related projects; (c) develop instructions and specifications for assuring and documenting quality control of field activities, proper handling, and timely disposition of all field samples and data. (d) Prepare contingency plans that anticipate adverse weather, equipment breakdown and other potential problems for boat, under-ice vessel, aerial and/or land vehicle work.  Task 4: Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing.  In Task 4, the contractor will collect the necessary data and perform appropriate statistical analyses to test the null hypotheses, Ho: Abundance of these species does not vary across -life stage, -habitat, -season; Ho: Distribution of these species does not vary across -life state, -habitat, -season, through a process that includes the following five components: (a) develop a data analysis plan prior to survey implementation, (b) specify, prior to survey implementation, the statistical tests to be used, (c) input and analyze all the primary data collected, including biological, physical, chemical and oceanographic data, (d) search for statistical evidence of how the target and other species collected in the course of the survey correlate with each other and how their abundance and distribution contribute to basic ecological understanding, (e) archive samples and data collected.  Task 5: Survey Evaluation and Recommendations.  In Task 5, the contractor shall evaluate survey accomplishments and recommendations in the final report in the form of the following four components: (a) understandings gained from the survey; (b) a review of the survey design based on the actual conditions and events encountered; (c) recommendations for future monitoring methodology applicable to MMS needs; (d) appendices consisting of detailed field and data analysis manuals sufficient to ensure the future surveys that may be implemented by new personnel use the same methods and analyses.  Task 6: Project Management.  The contractor shall follow a project management plan that provides lines of communication and coordination among all key personnel and management, and a mechanism for insuring coordination with the MMS COTR. HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience (2) your organizational experience and available facilities, (3) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact, telephone number, and email address) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.

<DESC>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Forces acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).  The RFP includes two documents that are not approved for public release:  the ALEP Block 2 Performance Specification (PS) Classified Annex and the ALEP Security Classification Guide (SCG).  The information in these documents is essential for proposal preparation/submittal.

As cited in the FedBzOps Notice each offeror must submit their CAGE code Code and classified fax number for security verification.  If classified fax number is not available, please provide a classified mailing address.

The release of the two documents mentioned above will require two actions: (1) Verification by Defense Security Services of your companys security status (any offerors who have not submitted their CAGE Code and classified fax number/mailing address previously must submit this information ASAP); and (2) Official request of these documents shall be submitted to the contracting officer via email to annabel.rivera@brooks.af.mil.

Document Type: 	Synopsis.
Solicitation Number:	GS06P06GZC0506.
Estimated Post Date:	June 6, 2006.
Estimated Response Date:	July 25, 2006.

Contracting Office Address:
General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service (PBS), Project Management Division (6PCA II), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131.

Description:

The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings.  The following document describes the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract for the proposed new United States Courthouse, to be located in Jefferson City, Missouri.  The scope includes Pre-Construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the design phase and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) , with Contingency Allowance for the Construction Phase Services Option is contemplated.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.  For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).

	Project Summary:  The proposed United States Courthouse will be constructed on a site within the CBD of Jefferson City, Missouri.  The new courthouse will provide the additional space needed to support the 10-year space needs of the United States Courts, which cannot be satisfied in the existing building due to structural, security, and space configuration constraints.  The project consists of a new courthouse of approximately  gross square meters (118,294 gross square feet), while containing  useable square meters (105,694 useable square feet).  The project will include 28 interior secure parking spaces and 75 exterior surface parking spaces.  The United States Courts, United States District and Bankruptcy Court Clerks, United States Probation, United States Pretrial Services, Federal Public Defender, United States Marshals Service, United States Attorney, the local offices of both State Senators, and the Congressman will occupy the facility.  The space will include four (4) courtrooms, two (2) District, two (2) Magistrate, and their associated supporting spaces; such as judges chambers, jury deliberation facilities, jury assembly/grand jury suites, holding cells, etc.  Office space will be provided for the other aforementioned tenants.  Occupancy is anticipated for 2nd quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2010.  The entire facility must be substantially complete within 960 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed (NTP) of the Construction Phase Option.  Project design and construction will meet, as a minimum, the Leadership in Energy Efficient Design (LEED) Silver Standard, as defined by the United States Green Buildings Council.

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSAs A-E firm yet to be selected.  At the time of contract award, projected to coincide with the program verification stage, the CMcs firm price for pre-construction and pricing for construction phase services, will form the basis of the contract.   In accordance with the successive targets, the CMc shall guarantee a maximum project price based on the facility described in the Governments construction documents and Request For Proposal (RFP) package.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CM's) and General Contractors (GC's).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is responsible, through design review, involvement in the project development and administration of the construction, for constructing the facility described by the Government at or below the defined budget - the project Estimated Construction Cost, or ECC.

Price Range: $50,000,000 to $55,000,000.

Proposal Submission Requirements:  Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202).  Stage I of the RFP will contain an explanation of the entire selection process, including the evaluation factors for Stage I and Stage II of the Request for Proposals (RFP).  Under Stage I, Offerors must submit information in descending order of importance regarding the firm's qualifications, past performance, past experience, proposed personnel, experience with electronic project management (e-PM), and other factors identified in the RFP.  Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Stage I RFP.  The Government will evaluate Stage I of the RFP submissions to identify and advise the Offerors about their potential to be viable competitors.  The Government shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the Stage I of the RFP, and shall advise each respondent in writing, either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  The Government shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the next stage of the acquisition.  Offerors must submit a Detailed Project Management Plan, Oral Presentation, Price Proposals, and Subcontracting Plans (if large business) under Stage II of the RFP.  All Stage II respondents shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project.  

Small Business Participation: In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns.  Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract.  Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small (50%), small disadvantaged (8%), small women-owned (5%), small HUBZone (3%) small veteran-owned (5%) and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small (3%) business concerns.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) for this project is 236220.

Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the above minimum goals for all subcontracted work.  An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement).  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13. FAR Clause 52.219-4 - Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply. The Stage II evaluation will be based on technical factors as well as price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on the evaluation of the Stage II submittals without holding discussions.  After technical and price evaluations, discussions and/or negotiations and Final Proposal Revisions, if required, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will make recommendation to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) of the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify interested parties of the upcoming Request for Proposal release for the Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI).  USTRANSCOM intends to issue an unrestricted solicitation, resulting in an indefinite delivery, requirements-type contract.  Period of performance for this contract will include a 3-year base period with two 1-year option periods, and the potential for the contractor to earn two additional 1-year award-term option periods, for a potential 7-year contract.  Solicitation release is scheduled on or about 21 Jun 06, and solicitation closing date is scheduled on or about 11 Aug 06.  Past and present performance information will be required to be submitted approximately 30 days after solicitation release.  This solicitation will be processed as a best-value source selection IAW DFARS 15.3 and USTRANSCOM/TCAQ Operating Instruction 05-11, TCAQ Source Selection Instructions.

DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations/load optimization and mode conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DOD shippers.  An implementation approach is envisioned with multiple phases based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements. 

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488510  Freight Transportation Arrangement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror / quoter INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD.  Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your quote.  Call 1-888-227-2423 or visit the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov/ for more information.  This procurement is unrestricted; all responsible sources may submit an offer.  This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13 and the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation number / RFP N00244-06-R-0036 applies; an electronic copy of the RFQ can be accessed at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 (5/19/06) and DFAR Change Notices effect!  ive through 5/19/06.  The standard industrial code is 4841 (NAICS 515210) and the business size standard is $13.5 million.  The agency need is for television services for the San Diego Navy Bases.  This requirement is for a fixed priced indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract.  The statement of objectives is as follows:  INTRODUCTION:  Commander, Navy Region Southwest (CNRSW) is seeking commercial sources capable of providing basic television services to Navy and Marine Corps (N/MC) Base locations within the San Diego metropolitan area.  CNRSW will procure basic television services for appropriated-fund (APF) activities as defined herein, and will grant access to Bases for marketing basic and additional television, data and voice services to non-appropriated fund (NAF) and personal-funded (PF) subscribers based on general guidelines defined in Attachment 1.  BACKGROUND:  Currently, the Greater San Diego area is receiving television service under a franchise agreement under which individual subscribers and Navy activities contract for television service. Individuals subscribe with personal funds (PF) directly with the television provider; Navy Non-Appropriated Fund activities, e.g. bowling alleys, gymnasiums, use non-appropriated funds (NAF); and instrumentalities of the Department of the Navy, e.g. Commands, Navy Piers, Headquarters/Command Groups that are part of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, and the Naval Medical Center, San Diego obtain television services via contract, payment by credit card, using appropriated funds. The current television provider serves approximately 6,000 total APF, NAF and PF subscribers. CNRSW will hereby enter into a contract with a television service provider for approximately 1700 subscribers, instrumentalities of the Department of the Navy, funded with appropriated funds. The existing Franchise Agreement will not be renewed.  CNRSW seeks, at a minimum, basic television services for all subscribers, and cost-effective commercial solutions for the installation and operation of television services and related unofficial services that do not rely on the Navy to provide existing infrastructure.  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES:  Creative, cost-effective, high-performance solutions to the technical and geographic objectives of the San Diego Navy and Marine Corps (N/MC) environment are encouraged.  A CNRSW Base Communications Program monitor will support the Contracting Officer, perform the day-to-day government oversight, and resolve all technical issues as they arise.  This monitor will be the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) for the contract.  The COTR will serve only as a liaison for issues arising out of the non-appropriated fund subscriptions. The Navy and contractor(s) will be working toward shared goals and objectives that include the following: 1)	Provide a level of services for the life of the contract at the same or better types and quality of services as available to the public and surrounding residential communities and commercial subscribers. 2)	Services that can be provided via any medium (e.g., cable, satellite, wireless, etc.), depending on the contractors best technical solution for satisfying the objectives. 3)	Service to the Bases listed in but not limited to the table below (paragraph 4). The total subscribers indicated in the table specify appropriated fund subscribers initially anticipated to be covered directly under this contract.  4)	Basic television service for subscribers to be served under this contract grouped for the purposes of technical proposals based on subscriber density and Base location as follows: a.	Low Density subscribers are defined as individual outlets up to 4 outlets per location, room or building.  b.	Medium Density subscribers are defined as multiple outlets per location, room or building, typical in a large office building with many outlets scattered throughout various offices and common areas. Generally speaking, medium density locations have less than 20 outlets in the building/complex.  c.	High Density subscribers are multiple dwelling unit type buildings with 20 or more outlets where most or all of the occupied units are wired for service, typical of a barracks, bachelor housing complex, or hotel type facility.  NOTE:  see hard copy of RFP for table in Statement of Objectives (SOO). 5)	Provide a minimum basic tier of services for appropriated-fund subscribers including but not limited to all major national news channels, local broadcast television channels, public access channels, educational access channels and government channel. The Balboa Naval Medical Center San Diego (Hospital) subscribers require a higher level of service that the other APF customers. This level of service will be available only to the Hospital, and may be priced separately according to the proposed contract line item. The requirements for the Hospital include: a.	An expanded tier of channels that is comparable to a commercial basic tier of service (as a point of reference, the current level of service is approximately 60 channels). b.	In addition to the PEG channels provided in the basic level of service to other APF subscribers, provide the additional capability to distribute six or more PEG channels that are capable of carrying content provided by the Hospital. c.	Provide broadband data connectivity capable of supporting video teleconferencing to remote Hospital branch clinics over the Internet. 6)	Maintain and operate a fully code-compliant, reliable television infrastructure. Provider(s) will be required to provide all infrastructure, personnel, tools, services, supplies, materials, supervision, equipment, and other items or services necessary to construct, install, operate, and maintain the television system(s) at the above listed locations. The provider will be responsible for all operational costs including construction and equipment. The cost for these services shall be included in the unit price of the basic services. 7)	Provide continuity of service to all subscribers through transition, sustaining operation and subscriber support.  Provide detailed transition plan that documents design, planning, installation, cutover, continuity of service, transition to sustaining operations, subscriber support and contract termination. 8)	Provide capability to modify services to meet changing Government needs, such as amending channel packages to provide DOD specific channels at some locations. 9)	Fulfill service orders in a timely manner. A Contractor Technical Representative (CTR) shall be able to respond in person to meet installation and maintenance objectives at all service locations during normal business hours within 24 hours of requested service, and 24/7 by telephone.  10)	Provide a monthly report deliverable in accordance with the Reporting Requirements of Appendix D. 11)	The Contractor shall maintain a database of all current subscribers in his standard subscriber computer system application. This database shall remain open for Government review at convenient times coordinated by mutual consent during the period of performance of the contract. The Government may request an annual report from the subscriber database to reconcile Government records and payments.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH intends to negotiate a five-year contract with the Pediatric and Life Course Epidemiology Research Group of the University of Newcastle in the United Kingdom to provide comprehensive, detailed, and systematic computerized data on pediatric computerized tomography (CT) examinations that can be linked to population-based cancer registries.  The main objective of the new contract is to identify, compile, and analyze population-based data so that a large study can be conducted to examine potential risks for cancer due to CT examinations conducted in adolescents.  Specifically, a cohort of at least 200,000 children who were given CT scans in large radiology departments between January 1985 and December 1995 will be compiled.  Electronic lists will be cross-linked to the databases of the UK general register office, the British Central Registry (NHS-CR), and local cancer registries to conduct a follow-up study of pediatric patients who underwent CT scans, in order to determine vital status and cancer occurrence through December 31, 2005.  The statutory authority for this non-competitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for the sole source designation is the contractors ability to provide a large radiation epidemiologic cohort and their ability to access existing electronic listings of CT examinations in the UK hospital radiology departments, regional and nationwide cancer population registries, and the National Health Service.  See numbered note 22 which states that the proposed action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  A Sources Sought Announcement was published for this acquisition on February 15, 2006 and no responses were received. However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis chromosome breakage testing for Fanconis anemia with Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), 2525 SW Third Avenue, Suite 350, Portland Oregon 97201 in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. 

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511and the business size standard is $12.5M.

The NCI, CGB, DCEG branch is engaged in an ongoing clinical genetics study of hereditary bone marrow failure disorders of childhood. Fanconis anemia is the prototype disease, and families with this syndrome will comprise the majority of patients seen on this particular study.  CGB has a need to obtain the results of the Fanconis anemia chromosome breakage test in order to appropriately classify family members as affected or unaffected by this disease. The samples will be derived from individuals who are members of families in which there is a clinical basis to suspect the diagnosis of Fanconis anemia. This particular study is part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, intramural research program within DCEGs Human Genetics Program which is focused upon elucidation of the entire spectrum of scientific and clinical issues related to familial and hereditary forms of cancer.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks: 1) receive samples of heparinized peripheral blood, lymphoblastoid or fibroblast cell lines with coded identification numbers from CBG investigators for chromosome breakage analysis. The Contractor shall be blinded to any identifying information pertaining to the individuals from whom these specimens were derived and will be prohibited from seeking any such information. Therefore, from the Contractors perspective, these samples shall be anonymous;  2) cells derived from these samples shall be exposed to diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin-C (MMC) [Cervenka et al, Am J Med Genet 15:211-223, 1983] in the laboratory, using standard testing protocols, to determine whether the cells are unusually sensitive to the chromosome-damaging effects of these DNA cross-linking agents.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Base Year: August 1, 2006  July 31, 2007 with four (4), twelve (12) month options. This requirement will be awarded as a firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  The contract will include a total minimum of twenty (20) tests and a maximum of forty (40) tests for the base year and for each option.  

Oregon Health and Science University is the only source known to the NCI that currently and routinely uses both diepoxybutane and mitomycin C as the cross-linking agents.  To continue laboratory studies NCI requires the services of Oregon Health Science University to provide continued support and complete uninterrupted analysis of further chromosome breakage testing.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the NCI study for chromosome breakage and the current study and diagnosis of Fanconis Anemia in patients.     

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material insufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT on June 21 , 2006 to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email the aforementioned individual to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) www.orca.bpn.gov.   Please reference NCI-60078-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The JIAPC objective is to provide a global, persistent, 24/7 collaborative environment, integrating the people, systems and tools required to conduct operations using the full spectrum of capabilities to achieve desired, focused effects against high value targets. The JIAPC is a world-wide, net-centric architecture that provides timely analysis, planning and targeting in support of Combatant Commanders (COCOM) IO requirements.  JIAPC will consist of an integrated network of the currently existing analysis centers to provide holistic analytic support to COCOMs. These analytic centers are identified in the IO Roadmap as the Electronic-Space Analysis Center (E-Space), the Human Factors Analysis Center (HFAC), the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), and the Joint Information Operations Center (JIOC).  Although JIAPC integrates analysis and planning capabilities to provide holistic characterization of potential targets in support of COCOMs effects-based planning (EBP) and effects-based operations (EBO). The JIAPC architecture will provide a capability for horizontal integration of operations and intelligence data using secure web-based access and state-of-the-art collaboration tools and practices. This will enable agile and adaptive strategies, plans, and operations by supporting a fused holistic information picture for commanders and decision makers employing effects-based targeting by both kinetic and non-kinetic means. A succession of spirals in the incremental development process will allow for the deployment of new capabilities to access additional databases, and other sources of intelligence data as well as analytic tools, displays, and processing innovations.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., to provide a Spot Picker for Reproductive Toxicology Division.  The current NAICS code is 334516. Based on the EPA's knowledge of the Spot Picker minimum specifications needed for this requirement, there may be unique capabilities to particular contractors.  The GE Healthcare Ettan Spot Picker is unique in that it is the only Spot Picker that is  compatible with Non-Linear Dynamics 2-D Analysis Software, which is used to perform the labs gel analysis.    The minimum specifications are as follows: Minimum Specifications for Spot Picker "  Must be compatible with spot pick lists from Non Linear Dynamics 2-D analysis software. "  Must be  able to pick spots from backed gels ( pre-cast gels, gels on glass or hand-cast gels) and able to pick and transfer of the plug into 4 x 96 well micro titre plates (MTP), with extremely high accuracy and efficiency, >99.9%. "  Must be able to pick protein spots from 2-D gels without backing, with  the same reliability and accuracy as it picks from backed gels. "  Must have hydrophobic coating on the picking head to ensure complete transfer of gel plug to MTP and no detectable sample carry-over, with no contamination (verified by mass spectrometry). "  Must pick from 2-D gels of up to 25 x  28 cm and any thickness. "  Protein spot picking is totally separated from 2-D gel image acquisition and image analysis, therefore, neither technique is compromised. "  Must use reference markers and coordinate transformation.   "  The picker must be compatible with a wide variety of detection  techniques, including but not limited to Coomassie Blue (CBB), Sypro Ruby (fluorescence), silver, radioactivity and DIGE minimal & saturation dyes. "  Must be fully compatible with DIGE saturation Cy Dye DIGE fluor labelling experiments. Capable of picking directly from saturation Cy Dye DIGE  fluor gels or a radioactive gel, without the need for any additional 2-D gel post-staining to visualize the gel. "  Must be capable of picking from a phosphor image. "  Must be able to pick from gels submersed under water, to reduce contamination and increase picking accuracy.  This has  advantages for reducing contamination and picking accuracy (gel will not shrink). "  Must be capable of at least 6 spots picked and transferred per minute.   "  The system's linear dynamic range must have five orders of magnitude (including the acquisition of the image and the picking). "  Must  have picking accuracy of   200 microns, this includes the imaging of the gel and robotic accuracy.  "  Must have a visible light in the scanner and the picker to protect the proteins. "  The system must be able to fit into a benchtop space of 65cm (wide) or less.    However, any firm believing  itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the  proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable  NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

USTRANSCOM will host subsequent one-on-one sessions with potential offerors to provide them an opportunity to address any specific areas of concern in regards to the release of the final DTCI solicitation.  The one-on-one sessions will not be a forum to market company specific capabilities or for vendors to obtain information that has not been shared with industry.  Preclude inclusion of strictly advertising or marketing type information.  Sessions will be strictly limited to 30 minutes and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.

The one-on-one sessions will be held 08-10 May 2006 at the DTCI Program Management Office located at 1710 Corporate Crossing, Suite 1, O'Fallon IL  62269.  To schedule a one-on-one session, please e-mail Ms. Carla Diamond at carla.diamond@ustranscom.mil no later than 14 April 2006.  For any specific questions, please contact Ms. Diamond at 618-622-2212, Ext. 2251.  Due to space limitations, a maximum of four company (4) representatives will be allowed to participate.  Please note that your participation in the one-on-one sessions will be at your company's expense.  USTRANSCOM will not provide any reimbursement for costs incurred in travel or other expenses.   Further, the government may use any information provided during the one-on-one sessions to complete market research.  We highly recommend you not discuss any information you deem as competitive sensitive or proprietary.  If you choose to provide any written documentation to support your discussion, recommend you appropriately identify any sensitive information to ensure proper safeguarding such as Corporate Proprietary Information and state the appropriate restrictions in the evaluation and use of the information provided.  USTRANSCOM appreciates your participation in this acquisition.

The following is a brief synopsis of the DTCI requirement.  Specific DTCI requirements will be identified in Performance Work Statement to be included in the upcoming draft solicitation release.

DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations / load optimization and modal conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DoD shippers.  A multiple phased implementation approach is envisioned based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements. Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements.

As of June 30, 2005, the registry fund total for all federal courts was approximately $3.3 billion of which $1.8 billion was invested in CRIS.  

Securities purchased are normally held until maturity.  Safety of principal and liquidity of investments without sacrificing principal are among the more important objectives of the CRIS.  The Clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, known as the CRIS Fund Manager, seeks a contractor to assist in developing portfolio strategies to accomplish the objectives of CRIS, to advise on the selection of specific investments, to execute directed securities transactions, and to maintain case-by-case accounting records.

In brief, each week the CRIS Fund Manager is advised of new deposits and planned withdrawals.  The contractor will advise what security transactions, consistent with the CRIS objectives, are appropriate in these instances.  The CRIS Fund Manager will then direct the contractor to buy or sell specific securities.  Securities purchased by the contractor will be transferred to the CRIS account in the Securities Handling Resource-sharing Endeavour (SHARE) system maintained by the Federal Reserve.  Once confirmation of the transfer has been received from the Federal Reserve Bank an immediate payment (deposit) will be recorded in the contractors reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  In those rare instances when securities must be sold prior to maturity, funds must be deposited in Treasurys General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the securities being transferred from the CRIS account in SHARE.  Because monies remain on deposit with the Treasury and are never in possession of the contractor, there are no collateral requirements.  The contractor will next update individual case records by adding new deposits, subtracting withdrawals and allocating portfolio earnings.  A case investment report will then be mailed to each court member.  Other portfolio information and statistics will be provided to the CRIS Fund Manager on a regular basis.  The solicitation is scheduled to be released on or about March 27, 2006.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, (202) 502-1574.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The overall objective of the proposed BAA is to create relationships with the  targeted Institutions and introduce the aforementioned Institutions to the  technology trends available at the U.S. Army Research, Development and  Engineering Center.  Although these concepts are considered basic research, it  is desirable to mature these concepts for possible future programs. No responses to this notice are required.  The purpose is only to advise  interested colleges, universities, and institutions of the intent of the  Department of the Army to introduce a BAA on the aforementioned topics at the  time frame cited in this message. 	Commander U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC 	Attn: AMSTA-AQ-APJ, Mr. Robert M. Grados 	Building 9 	Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000 	Questions may be emailed to: 	 rgrados@pica.army.mil,  (973) 724-8718 If your institution has either an existing or developmental item that meets the  specified requirements please be advised as to the release date.  This is a pre- solicitation notice.  There is no formal solicitation available at this time.   A formal solicitation will be generated on or about  June 22, 2006.  THIS IS  NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A  SOLICITATION.  Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any  information submitted under this announcement.  An award may or may not be made  as a result of the proposed BAA.  There is no need to submit information at  this time.  See Numbered Notes 5 and 26.

<DESC>The Army is seeking information on products, methods and equipment to rapidly harden surfaces.  Advances in surfacing technology have led to the introduction of many new products in the commercial construction industry for surface hardening, finishin g, refinishing, maintenance and upkeep.  These products provide alternatives to conventional methods of surface treatment and in some cases claim to perform similarly to asphalt and concrete with respect to strength, toughness and durability.  Additional b enefits are alleged in the areas of reduced application efforts, material storage, material cost, transportation and equipment required for installation.  Some of these technologies include the use of fast curing/rapid activating polymers, carbon fibers an d low dosage resins, woven and non-woven geotextiles and various fiber reinforced materials. In an effort to keep pace with technological advances within the commercial construction industry and to seek alternatives to conventional surfacing procedures and  materials, the U.S. Army Manuever Support Center, Ft Leonard Wood, MO and Product Manager, Combat Engineer/Material Handling Office, TACOM, are interested in exploring these new technologies and investigating their usefulness at being applied in various m ilitary missions and environments.  Areas of key interest with these products are:  (1) fast activating/curing of material; (2) hardness, strength and durability of material; (3) ease of material application; (4) minimal/reduced equipment required during m aterial application; (5) transportation, storage and logistical requirements of material; (6) thickness, composition and application alternatives of materiel on various types of existing surfaces; and (7) application conditions and performance limitations in various environments/conditions.

This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be  advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.

<SUBJECT>H--National Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC)
<SOLNBR>W912DY-06-R-0018
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>08292006
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is for a National Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC). The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that Federal agencies reduce energy consumption in buildings by 20 percent relative to a 1985 baseline by the year 2000. Executive order 12902 and OPNAV 4100.5D further increased the mandated energy savings to 30% by the year 2005.  ESPC contracts are one method available to the Government to reduce energy consumption.   ESPC allows an activity the flexibility of purchasing new energy efficient equipment and systems with no up-front cost. Under ESPC an Energy Service Company (ESCO) provides expertise and private financing for the development and implementation of energy pr ojects. Contracts can be awarded for a period up to 25 years and are financed by the contractor at no capital cost to the government. The cost of the project is repaid over the term of the contract through savings realized from lower utility costs. Energy cost savings measures in aggregate must be able to have their costs, including debt service and ESCO fees paid through savings over the ESPC term. Some common products and services provided by an ESCO include: Equipment/system design, Equipment/system inst allation, Equipment/system testing, Operations, Maintenance and repair, etc. The Government intends to engage a contractor and/or contractors, hereto referred to as ESCOs, to investigate, develop, and submit to the Government Energy Cost Savings Measures (ECSMs) in the 50 sates, Washington D. C., and all U.S. Territories.   The t ypes of projects awarded under the contract are anticipated to be electrical, mechanical, water/wastewater, and renewable energy type projects.  This contract is intended for use by federal and state Government facilities, and when implemented will provide  energy dollar savings to the Government.  State government facilities are included to allow for the development of energy projects in state facilities that are co-located on federal installations or facilities such as the Army National Guard.  Unless othe rwise indicated herein or directly by the contracting officer, the scope of this contract will include any ECSM(s) proposed by the contractor and accepted by the Government and any ECSMs proposed by the Government.  It is however the objective of the Gove rnment to first initiate the ECSMs and then request proposals from the contractors in order to enhance full and open competition of the initiated ECSMs.  Multiple contract awards shall be made under this acquisition.  One of the awards may cover small business concerns provided that two (or more) small businesses meeting the technical, capacity, credit, and competency requirements in order to perform ESPC c ontracts are available.  The Government intends to award contracts based upon information contained in the offerors initial proposal (without discussion), circumstances permitting.  Depending on the content and quality of the offerors proposals, all awar ds may be made either with or without discussions. If discussions become necessary a competitive range shall be established followed by a request for Final Proposal Revisions only to those ESCOs meeting the evaluation criteria. It is also conceivable that  no awards would be possible without discussions.  The resultant contracts awarded from this solicitation will constitute Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts valued at approximately $20 - $500 million each as defined in FAR 16.50 4.  The method of ordering shall be in the form of the issuance of Task orders.  The Task orders will be issued bilaterally.  This solicitation and resultant contract awards are for a 10-year (ordering) period.  The initial ordering period shall be for fiv e years, with two additional ordering periods of three and two years respectively.  Performance of any task orders placed during the ordering period shall not exceed a total of 25-years of the contract term. The government i s under no obligation to issue any orders against contracts resulting from this solicitation.  42 USC 8287 provides that the contractor shall incur the costs of implementation energy savings measures, including at least the costs (if any) incurred in maki ng energy audits, acquiring and installing equipment, and training personnel, in exchange for a share of any energy savings directly resulting from implementation of such measures.  The Government is prohibited by law from paying a contractor if energy sa vings are not generated; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee the contractor a minimum dollar task order.  The Government guarantees that the contractor will be given fair opportunity and equal consideration for award of task orders unless the Govern ment determines that the task order meets one of the exceptions to fair opportunity as identified in FAR 16.505. The Government reserves the right to synopsize and award additional contracts for similar work prior to the contract award or during the performance period of the resulting contracts. Huntsville Engineering and Support Center is the only authorized ordering office.  Other ordering offices may be added by modification at the discretion of the contracting officer.   Contact Information: If you have any questions or would like to request additional information concerning this requirement, please contact Ms. Ginger Gruber (256)895-1367 or Ms. Sarah Annerton (256)895-1167, 4820 University Square, Huntsville, AL 35816.

<DESC>1.  Project: Initial Task Order.  The Tamiami Trail portion of the Modified Water Deliveries to Everglades National Park Project involves the acquisition of land for privately-owned tracts south of Tamiami Trail (Highway 41) of Miami-Dade County, Flo rida as part of the overall Central and South Florida Project. NOTE:  Future task orders may be issued for these services in FL, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands during the course of the contract. 2.  Purpose:  In order to comply with Department of Justice standards and regulations, Real Estate Division must acquire title insurance for each tract of land.  A requisite of obtaining title insurance is to pay a premium for such insurance.  The title in surance premium rates are regulated by the State of Florida (FL. Admin. Code Ann., Chapter 69, 69O-186.003, see attached). 3.  Statement of Work:  An initial title commitment is obtained from the title company in order to determine ownership and any defects on the title to the land.  Once title to the land has been cleared of all unacceptable defects, the title company issues a title endorsement removing encumbrances from the title commitment and updates the status of the title to determine if any other defects have occurred since the date of the title commitment.  If no new defects appear on the title, the property is acquired  by Real Estate Division.  Thereafter, a final title policy must be issued to the U.S. government covering the government from causes of actions relating to items covered in the final title policy.  A title insurance premium, promulgated by the State of Fl orida, is paid in addition to the final title policy amount.  Should any item that appeared on the title commitment be cleared after the final title policy is issued, the title company will issue an endorsement to the final title policy. 4.  Deliverables:  The title company will issue legal descriptions for the tracts specified by the Corps in a format required by the Corps, initial title commitments (preliminary binders with exceptions); continuations of title (updates of title); final ti tle policies; Severable Use Right (SUR) information; Oil, Gas and Minerals ownership information; and any other business products that may be obtained from a title company, including but not limited to escrow and closing services.  The selected title compa ny should use a Department of Justice approved title underwriter for all title products stated above.  All items will be delivered within 45 days of the notice to proceed.  It is anticipated that the selected title company will produce all title commitment s within two weeks.  Payment made on acceptance by government.  Furthermore, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attorney(s) will conduct the real estate closings; however, the Corps may request that the title company perform all curative work necessary to c lear title to the land and prepare a case for closing within 30 days of the Corps request.  Should the title companys efforts to clear title be unsuccessful or appear to take a significant amount of time beyond the 30 days, the title company will notify the Corps so that condemnation procedures can be initiated in order to clear title to the property.  Final title policies should be produced within 45 days of closing. The government intends to award a fixed price indefinite quantity contract for these services for one year with four one-year options. The total ceiling price of the contract, with options, will be $550,000.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small bu siness under NAICS 541191, the size standard of which is $6.5 Million.

<DESC>MODIFICATION - This modification changes the response date from June 17, 2006 to July 3, 2006.  SYNOPSIS - This is a notice of intent to issue a sole-source, no-cost purchase order to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 330, Marina del Rey, CA  90292.  The period of performance for this effort will be five years, with a one-year base period and four one-year options.  The Government will award this purchase order on July 17, 2006.  

The Contractor shall support the operation of the Internet and its domain name and numbering system (DNS) by performing three, interdependent technical Internet coordinating functions, known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  In support of the operation of the Internet DNS, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to perform the following services.  First, the Contractor shall coordinate the assignment of technical protocol parameters.  This function involves the review and assignment of unique values to numerous parameters (e.g., operation codes, port numbers, object identifiers, protocol numbers) used in various Internet protocols.  This function also includes dissemination of listings of assigned parameters through various means (including on-line publication) and the review of technical documents for consistency with assigned values.  Second, the Contractor shall perform administrative functions associated with root management.  This function primarily involves facilitation and coordination of the root zone of the Internet DNS.  It includes receiving requests for and making routine updates of the country code top level domain contact and nameserver information. Third, the Contractor shall allocate Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) delegations of Internet Protocol (IP) address space.  This function includes delegation of IP address blocks to regional registries for routine allocation, typically through downstream providers, to Internet end-users within the regions served by those registries.  It also includes reservation and direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast addressing, addresses for private networks, and globally specified applications.  

This procurement is being conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C.  253(c)(1)  only one responsible source, which applies when the services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy the agencys needs.  The IANA functions have been performed under contract with the Government for more than 25 years, previously under the auspices of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  As DARPAs contract with the University of Southern California (USC) neared expiration in 1999, the Government recognized the need for the continued performance of the IANA functions as vital to the stable and secure technical functioning of the Internet and developed a transition plan for this responsibility.  On December 24, 1998, USC entered into a transition agreement with ICANN under which ICANN secured directly from USC all necessary resources, including key personnel, intellectual property, and computer facility access critical to the continued performance of the IANA functions.  Having assumed these key resources (as well as other responsibilities associated with privatization of the Internet DNS management through its Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Commerce), the Department of Commerce determined that ICANN was uniquely positioned to undertake performance of these functions and entered into a contract with ICANN.   The Department has issued three sole source contracts to ICANN under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to perform the IANA functions:  February 8, 2000; March 21, 2001; and March 13, 2003.  The current contract with ICANN expires on September 30, 2006. 

Offerors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirements detailed above.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit the agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than ten (10) days after publication of this synopsis.  See government-wide numbered note 22.  A copy of the Statement of Work is available on NTIAs website at www.ntia.doc.gov.

All responses to this synopsis may be submitted via e-mail to Brendon Johnson, Contracting Officer, at bjohnson@doc.gov, with a copy to Carol Silverman, Contracting Officer, at csilverman@doc.gov.  A hard copy shall be provided to the U. S.

<DESC>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Forces acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).  The RFP includes two documents that are not approved for public release:  the ALEP Block 2 Performance Specification (PS) Classified Annex and the ALEP Security Classification Guide (SCG).  The information in these documents is essential for proposal preparation/submittal.

As cited in the FedBzOps Notice each offeror must submit their CAGE Code and classified fax number for security verification.  If classified fax number is not available, please provide a classified mailing address.

The release of the two documents mentioned above will require two actions: (1) Verification by Defense Security Services of your companys security status (any offerors who have not submitted their CAGE Code and classified fax number/mailing address previously must submit this information ASAP); and (2) Official request of these documents shall be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Richard M. Williams, HSG/PSK, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks City-Base, TX 78235-5119. Telephone 210-536-4728, email richard.williams@brooks.af.mil and the Contract Specialist, Mr. Brian Stives, HSG/PSK, Phone 210-536-2068 email brian.stives@brooks.af.mil.

Any concerns regarding this acquisition may be directed to the contracting officer.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the contracting officer, interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman, Mr. Edward Noack at 210-536-2319 or email edward.noack@brooks.af.mil.  No collect calls.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals or a request for quotations; it is strictly a Request For Information (RFI).  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  The Government will not pay for  costs associated with developing a response to this RFI.  No other information is available to respondents. BACKGROUND 1. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)) is responsible for the management of the Military Health System (MHS).  The MHS is a $33 billion dollar per year enterprise that provides operational medicine, training, researc h, and Force Health Protection support across the full range of military operations.  It also delivers health care for the system's 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries through TRICARE direct and managed care programs.  The transformation of the MHS has been  ongoing and significant.  Recent initiatives have led to the development of a comprehensive strategic and annual business planning process, new purchased care contracts, a streamlined regional TRICARE management structure, and formulary and Federal pricin g for pharmacy services.  As a part of the ongoing MHS Transformation effort, the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) identified a number of initiatives needed to further improve system effectiveness and efficiency.  The Innovation Investment Process (IIP) is  one of these major initiatives.  The IIP is a process by which organizations within the MHS can expeditiously obtain funding for projects that reduce the cost of health care to the MHS.  The IIP will be capable of sponsoring large-scale innovations requir ing an initial investment of capital; successful innovations will return their initial investment to the IIP over multiple fiscal years.  Each investment will be based upon a sound business case analysis, as determined by a Board of Directors. 2. The MHS' TRICARE system delivers health care through a worldwide network of over 70 inpatient and 409 outpatient facilities and supplements that care through a series of private sector contracts that provide physician and hospital networks, retail and m ail order pharmacy benefits, claims processing, marketing, and medical management.  The TRICARE program provides a triple option benefit, including Prime (a Health Maintenance Organization-style benefit requiring beneficiary enrollment to a Primary Care Ma nager (PCM)), Extra (a Preferred Provider Organization-style benefit); and Standard (a fee-for-service benefit).  Beneficiary program eligibility, availability, and costs are based on beneficiary category and location.  Notwithstanding inherent differences  in service availability among locations, the MHS strives to achieve a uniform benefit.  A key objective of the Managed Care Support Services contracts is to optimize the healthcare services within the hospitals and clinics operated by the MHS; that object ive is consistent with the objectives of the IIP. 3. Funding for the operation of MHS inpatient and outpatient facilities is allocated based on historical budgets.  The MHS is currently implementing a prospective payment system that will change the allocation system to pay prospectively on the value of he alth care provided.  To determine the prospective payment, MHS inpatient and outpatient facilities are required to build a business plan which projects their annual enrollment and healthcare delivery targets.  The prospective payment system will be fully i mplemented for covered activities in FY 2008.  Additional activities will be added over the next few years until all healthcare delivery is covered by prospective payment.  Currently, the value of health care is determined by healthcare workload but in the  future, elements of a capitation payment system, as well as quality performance incentives, may be introduced. 4.  The MHS maintains the following systems that provide data on the healthcare delivery system and can provide input for IIP busin ess case analyses:  MHS Management Analysis and Reporting Tool (M2)  for population data, inpatient and outpatient workload data, and claims data; and Expense Assignment System IV (EASIV) for facility cost data. NOTIONAL CONCEPT 1.  The MHS has little experience with market-based decision making for healthcare system capital investments, but believes that such experience/expertise exists in the private sector.  To implement the IIP, the MHS desires to leverage private sector exper ience and expertise regarding healthcare system capital investment decision making.   2.  The MHS seeks to contract with a firm that has/uses an existing analytic tool that is capable of performing business case analyses, assessing the risk of a proposed initiative, and performing return on investment calculations for healthcare system capi tal investments.  The analysis will also identify potential impacts on medical readiness, access to care, quality of care and will consider the time necessary to implement each proposed initiative. 3.  The analytic tool must be adaptable to account for differences between private sector and MHS delivery systems, such as funding sources, payers, patient population, readiness requirements, medical education, accounting impacts such as taxes and depreci ation, risk apportionment between the MHS hospitals/clinics and the Managed Care Support Contracts, and DOD policies and regulations. 4.  The analytic tool must be capable of evaluating initiatives that are local, regional, or national in scope.   5.  The contractor will have expertise in healthcare investment, be able to work with the MHS to identify IIP opportunities, and will share in the savings associated with initiatives that are approved and adopted by the MHS.  6.  The contractor, through rights or licensing of the adapted analytic tool, will provide the MHS with the capability to continue to use the analytic tool after the expiration of the contract. 7.  The contractor will provide MHS representatives/organizations with training on the use of the analytic tool.  8.  The contractor will work with the MHS to develop plans of action to implement approved IIP initiatives. RESPONSES To be of greatest value, responses should be received by 4:00 p.m.,  June 26, 2006.  Electronic submissions (email with Microsoft Word attachment) are required.  Attachments should be no longer than 20 pages. Please send responses to kathy.doyle-lehman@det.amedd.army.mil . Responses should address the following areas: a. Questions on the Notional Concept: 1. Is the notional concept the best way to meet MHS objectives?  Why or why not? 2. Is the type of IIP analytic tool envisioned by the MHS available in the private  sector? 3. Is it feasible to adapt an existing analytic tool to incorporate the attributes that are unique to the MHS? 4. If you believe the notional concept is the best way to meet MHS objectives, discuss the personnel and method that you would propose to use to meet those objectives.  If you believe an alternative approach will better meet MHS objectives, discuss that ap proach and the personnel and method that you would propose to use. 5. Please provide a rough order of magnitude cost for the initial effort (including a proposed alternative approach) and the ongoing licensure/maintenance costs. 6. Describe any other challenges or special considerations the Government should take into account. b. Capabilities Statement 1. Tell us about your organization and its capabilities to meet IIP objectives.  Identify your organization's salient characteristics: overall qualifications and expertise of the firm; relevant experience with respect to MHS IIP objectives; small or large business, for profit or not for profit, university or consortium, etc.  Provide the contract number for any Federal supply schedule contracts held by your organization. 2. You may identify current or prospective teaming partners, their salie nt characteristics, and relevant experience. 3. Potential conflicts of interest.  Disclose your past and current contractual relationships with the MHS.  Disclose the past and current contractual relationships with the MHS of your current or prospective teaming partners.  Disclose the past and curren t clients who have contractual relationships with the MHS.

<DESC>This synopsis is being reissued to adjust the response date so that it reflects the due date for responses to the just published solicitation. This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED) of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA)  National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) in Duluth, Minnesota which has a requirement for a bench top liquid chromatograph-mass selective detector with a triple quadrupole mass analyzer (LC-MS-MS) system.  ?	This instrument will be delivered to and assembled at the U.S.EPA NHEERL/MED-Duluth laboratory where it will remain and be used for toxicological research.  ?	The LC-MS-MS instrument system must be capable of analyzing automated on-line microdialysis samples utilizing a microbore capable HPLC system. Hardware and software connectivity between instrument components and microdialysis injection equipment is a critical element. The HPLC sub-system is to consist of gradient capable mixing pumps at low flow, Peltier cooled autosampler, solvent degasser, sample enrichment capabilities, diode array detector, fluoresence detector and be able to accept external start/stop signal from external sample injection loop.  ?	The system should be able to be configured to be very tolerant of dissolved high solids and salts with low maintenance. No loss of sensitivity during runs of up to 96 hours and 200 injections are required. If special cones, torches, lenses, shields, spray chambers, nebulizers...etc are required to meet this requirement the seller must include these items in duplicate for this acquisition. ?	The instrument system and cart must be mobile and be able to fit through the 40" wide doorways to allow for transport between labs. ?	Automatic system startup, shutdown and optimization and computer controlled instrument tuning for optimum performance. ?	The LC-MS-MS system must function from a single computer workstation. Connectivity between the MS-MS and HPLC must be complete as defined below: 1)  Bidirectional communication between the MS-MS and the HPLC components is essential. If any LC component fails or the MS-MS faults,  the system must not continue running and consuming samples scheduled to be analyzed. The total system should shut down or go into idle status without loss of previously injected sample data. Starting and stopping of system modules must be programmable events from the system software via the workstation. 2)  All data generated from the LC-MS-MS must be saved in the event of a fatal system fault, up to completion of the previously injected sample during a sequenced run. 3)  Real Time viewing of the LC-MS-MS data stream ( ie.  chromatogram) must be possible. Alternatively, the ability to view a current chromatogram at a moment during its generation is acceptable. 4)  The system must be capable of multi-tasking. During active LC-MS-MS operation and sample measurement it must be possible to process, view, reintegrate or transfer data files and view sequences previously saved. The data system must allow modification of the sequence being actively run to accommodate necessary changes in the sample scheduling.  5)  Two copies or licenses to use the software at other non-instrument workstations for data manipulation shall be provided. ?	System shall have CD ROM based presentations, delivered by application experts, on the following topics: Solution Chemistry, Sample Preparation, System Diagnostics, System Startup, De-convolution, System Calibration and LC/MS Fundamentals. These presentations are to include full video and audio features.      ?	System shall have on-line logbooks that provide date- and time-stamped records of runs, errors, and maintenance events.  ?	System shall allow for the creation of LC/MS spectral libraries. System shall allow for library searches based on both UV/VIS and mass spectral libraries. Installation: ?	System shall include installation, basic instrument overview, four day operator?s training course, a 1 year warranty, and a 1 year telephone support contract provided in the list price of the product.  A computer based training module and system maintenance procedures shall be provided on CD-ROM.  ?	Hard copies of instrument (i.e., HPLC-MS-MS) service manuals along with detailed schematics for all instrument parts and functions must be provided.  These instrument manuals must cover instrument maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  ?	The seller must include all associated hardware, regulators, gas lines, controllers,  software, ... etc, in their submission so that the system will fully function on-site without the EPA purchasing additional items.  ?	HPLC-MS\MS instrument performance specifications must be guaranteed and demonstrated by on-site performance. The Vendor will provide the device under a turn-key installation to be accepted by the Government. ?	A simplified low concentration method utilizing LC-MS/MS configured with an on-line microdialysis injector currently used by EPA MED-Duluth personnel will be set up, instrument connectivity established and multiple samples ran successfully by the vendor representative as part of confirmation of a successful installation. EPA MED-Duluth personnel will provide all solutions and column hardware necessary.  Additional requirements and the specific specifications for each of the follow major components of this acquisition will be made available along with the solicitation: I) LC-MS-MS Requirements and Performance Specifications, II) HPLC Requirements, and III) Computer Requirements. The North American Industry Classification Code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

Receive-only AIS equipment

1.	Request responders provide equipment specifications, capabilities, descriptions, photographs, etc. for AIS receivers / base stations that fulfill the requirements listed below.  

2.	AIS receiver requirements are:
A.  Comply with the "Draft NAIS Base Station Receiver Specification,"
      AIS Base Stations (Transceivers) listed below.  
B.	Receiver Sensitivity better than or equal to -115 dBm as defined for 20% Packet Error Rate (PER)
C.	Integrated GPS receiver
D.	Received signal strength indication
E.	Compliance with ITU-R M.1371-1 and the IEC 62320-1 AIS Base station CDV as further clarified by the 62320-1 USA Comments
F.	Remotely configurable and controllable via receiver interface (RS-232, RS-422, Ethernet, etc.)


AIS Base Stations (Transceivers))

1.	AIS Base Stations shall meet the requirements of the IEC 62320-1 AIS Base Station CDV as further clarified by the 62320-1 USA Comments, except that the receiver sensitivity performance on AIS1 and AIS2 shall be -115dBm or better, and any deviations to any of the other receiver parameters that are necessary to meet this improved receiver sensitivity level should be noted.

2.	The AIS Base Station shall be tested and certified by the manufacturer to meet the applicable parts of IEC 62320-1 Ed. 1 CDV and the USA Comments within the limitations of this specific application. The manufacturer shall provide a Certificate of Compliance and verifiable (including rights of inspection) documentation in the form of test measurement setup and test results demonstrating compliance with this requirement.

AIS controller, message processing and position display software

1. 	Software associated with the AIS Base Stations shall comply with IEC 61162 and IEC 62320-1, including the 62320-1 USA Comments. The Base Station shall process all valid AIS messages from the VDL in accordance with IEC 62320-1 Ed. 1 CDV, Section 6.2.1 (4th bullet, "Every received VDL message shall be passed to the PI as a VDM sentence without further data content processing."). This requirement shall be interpreted to include all Messages 1-63 that comply with the packet format specified in ITU-R M.1371-2. Since IEC 62320-1 Ed. 1 CDV, Section 10.2.1.11 tests only the current AIS Messages 1-24, the manufacturer shall provide evidence (in the form of an illustrated technical explanation) that the receiver is designed to satisfy this requirement for future Messages 25-63.

2.	Graphical Display Software shall allow for:
-	Use of raster scan nautical charts
-	Display received AIS messages by selecting associated vessel icon
-	Display history of selected AIS messages graphically (vessel historical trackline)
-	Set boundaries (geographically fixed or surrounding a vessel) and alarms to notify operator when vessels cross boundary
-	Ability to filter vessels displayed by type, length, cargo, etc.
-	Ability to perform VDL management of selected base stations

List of Draft Standards

Reference Documents:
1.	IEC 62320-1 AIS Base Station CDV
2.	62320-1 USA Comments
3.	ITU-R M.1371-2

Receive-only Requirements

Baseline Considerations:
1.	Receive-only system
2.	No Channel Management
3.	External interface (RS-232), AC and DC power conditioning and RF protection are provided by the NAIS.
4.	A triple-cavity RF band-pass filter is provided by the NAIS in the antenna feed-line to protect the AIS Receiver from lightning and from high-level external RF signals beyond the required limits of IEC 62320-1 Ed.1 CDV.  
5.	AIS Base Station requirements apply, with limitations (see Minimum Requirements).
6.	Off-the-shelf equipment is preferred as much as possible.
7.	Technical standards are available and applicable, with limitations and modifications.
8.	Future-proof provisions include the processing of all AIS message types (see Minimum Requirements 4.).

Minimum Requirements:

1.	The NAIS Base Station Receiver shall meet the applicable functional performance, interface protocol and test requirements of IEC 62320-1 Ed.1 CDV for a receive-only system without channel management operating only on AIS1 (161.975 MHz) and AIS2 (162.025 MHz) on a 25 KHz channel bandwidth.
2.	The 62320-1 USA Comments must be considered for clarifying and correcting errors in the published CDV (Committee Draft for Voting). Additionally, the improved receiver sensitivity requirement (refer to comment USA 20) shall be met, but only in the limited frequency range (161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz only).
a.	Receiver Sensitivity of -115dBm or better is required on AIS1 and AIS2.
b.	Receiver operation is required only on AIS1 and AIS2.
c.	Other IEC 62320-1 Ed. 1 CDV parameter requirements and test requirements shall be met but only relative to receive-only operation and wanted signal performance on AIS1 and/or AIS2. The following examples are intended to explain this requirement, but these examples are not intended to include all the applicable requirements:
i.	Section 9.2 is not required, since there is no transmitter requirement in this application.
ii.	Paragraph 9.3.1 is changed to perform the test at 161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz and to set the level of the test signal generator to -115dBm instead of -107dBm, since improved receiver sensitivity is required and this application restricts receiver operation to only AIS1 and AIS2.
iii.	Paragraph 9.3.2 is not required, since there is no requirement for 12.5 KHz channel operation.
iv.	Paragraph 9.3.3 is unchanged, since this test is already performed on AIS1 (161.975 MHz).

<DESC>Additional information about FBCB2 BFT can be found at http://peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil/FBCB2/fbcb2.html.  Potential sources are requested to submit a white paper that addresses the following information.  The goal of the white paper is to collect the  information necessary to determine the availability of potential suppliers to provide the needed supplies and services.  Interested suppliers are requested to provide answers to all questions based upon the information and requirements provided.   1. Please describe your companys qualifications and experience to design, validate, test, and build the satellite network monitoring and management capability on time and within budget, while meeting the necessary requirements.   2.Please describe in detail your proposed solution to provide the Army MT-2011E Transceivers and FBCB2 bandwidth requirements and end-to-end satellite communication network with the features and capabilities described in this RFI.   In your response, pleas e describe, in detail, the over-the-air MT-2011E waveform and how you will insure that MT-2011E equipment provided by your company will be interoperable with MT-2011E equipment previously procured in prior years from CMDC.  Describe how you believe your co mpany has acquired the necessary expertise and information needed to build duplicate CMDC Model MT-2011E Transceiver equipment and to insure that proper network encryption and data protection capabilities are maintained.   3. Is your proposed MT-2011E Transceiver solution based on an existing product that is currently available?  If so, please describe that product and explain what modifications are required to adapt it to provide the FBCB2 BFT capabilities.     4. Describe how the transceiver will be controlled from the FBCB2 computer and over the air from satellite hub equipment and network management center. 5. Describe how you plan to package the transceiver including provisions for vibration, shock, water resistance and physical connectors.  What environmental requirements and extremes will your equipment operate under? 6. What is the expected Nonrecurring Engineering (NRE) cost associated with producing a solution to meet the requirements specified in this RFI?  This also includes the building and testing of first article equipment.  Assume that system and unit specifica tions, status reports, design reviews, test procedures, test reports and other documentation normally associated with this type of program will be required.  Please provide an itemized list of NRE tasks.   7. What will be expected unit cost for the MT-2011E vehicle mounted transceivers?  Assume that the procurement quantities are a minimum of 5,000 units per year. 8.Describe the procedure for remotely configuring transceivers.  This should include adding new channels, switching beams and locking transceivers onto different satellites. What other Over-The-Air (OTA) capabilities will your proposed system support? 9.We anticipate that a contract award can be made in November 2006 and operational satellite bandwidth worldwide will be required to be operational by 1 January 2007, with full network management capability.  In addition, we anticipate that initial deliver y of 500 MT-2011E Transceivers are needed to be delivered to the Government by March 15, 2007.    Please specify any concerns you would have with meeting these required milestones.   If you cannot meet any of these milestones, suggest alternatives that you  will be able to meet.

<DESC>The US Army ARDEC-Picatinny is conducting a Market Survey to identify  potential sources for supplying the U.S. Army with the establishment of the  Center for Integrated Security Logistics. The requirement for this award is to  establish a Center for Integrated Security Logistics and begin the process of  developing four components that will dramatically improve the Office of  Homeland Defense ability to respond to emergency events via a more secure  logistics supply chain as well as have application to similar problems  encountered by the Army's ammunition distribution mission.  The four systems  are: a) HSMS, a low-cost, high reliability health and status monitoring system  (HSMS) as a safeguard against specific environmental degradations; b) IAS, an  Intelligent Asset system (IAS) for real-time inventory of assets; c) AAC, a  real-time AIT concept to enable total Asset Accountability/Consumption (AAC)  down to the emergency response system.  Enables on location visibility of  shipped assets; and d) AAL, an Anticipatory (Sense and Respond) Asset Logistics  Portal (AALP) for responsive end-to-end supply chain. All of these proposed  systems will be demonstrated at Homeland Defense exercises planned for the next  FY. This approach will also be tailored to support similar visibility and  accountability problems with the Army's ammunition supply chain and  demonstrated at various ammunition supply point nodes.  Delivery is planned for  the first quarter of the fiscal year 2007.  The Government intends to award on  sole source basis, a contract to University of Maryland, Center for Public  Policy and Private Enterprise, School of Public Affairs. Respondents should  have sufficient capability to furnish these requirements to the U.S. Army.   Interested firms, who feel they are capable, are invited to indicate their  interest by providing to the U.S. Army a brief summary of their companys  capabilities including brief description of facilities, personnel, and past  experience. A follow-up detailed questionnaire may be provided to survey  respondents and on-site visits may be performed as a result of further  analysis. Also, interested firms should provide the name, address, point-of- contact with telephone number and e-mail address, size of business  (small/large) and where the facility is located. The information must be  submitted within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to: U.S.  Army TACOM-ARDEC/ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APJ, Ms. Rachael Houle/Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07850/e-mail: rachael.houle@us.army.mil.  If there are any technical questions,  please contact Mr. Alan Santucci @ (973) 724-4737. This Market Survey is for  planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or  as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does  not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise  pay for information solicited. The information you provide will only be used by  the U.S. Army in developing its acquisition approach for future warhead  research and development requirements.

<DESC>Description

This requirement is for one year interim service and possible option to continue for two additional years based on satisfactory performance.  This requirement calls for lease and rental of electric generators and ancillary power distribution system to meet the maximum power requirements of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activities where grid based power is inadequate or not available.  This requirement is not a Request for Proposal, but a survey to locate sources capable of providing all necessary engineering expertise, qualified personnel, equipment, fuel, and operation and maintenance to ensure continuous uninterrupted supply of electric power.    

The FEMA Headquarters Logistics has a requirement for standby-by contract sources for critical disaster commodities and professional program support services (for multiple programs) that will enable FEMA to proactively support the logistical emergency necessities associated with natural and man-made disasters. 
The Contractor will be asked to provide mobile generator support to fulfill the requirements of FEMA Headquarters and Regional Logistics for logistics support services needed to respond to Presidential-declared emergencies within the United States and its territories and possessions.  The Contractor also may be used to provide such services in emergencies not declared by Presidential decree.  These services are in support of disaster recovery assistance requirements resulting from hurricane devastation, and/or potential future disasters.  

FEMA is looking for firm(s) that can provide up to 3 Mega Watts of mobile power generation capability within 72 hours of notice to proceed.   The contractor must be capable of providing the power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and assign qualified personnel to respond within one hour to an order for service or request for assistance.  The generator contractor must be willing to receive management/oversight guidance from USACE and/or a FEMA designated on-site Project Officer/Officer in Charge in addition to COTR and CO.  Following sections provide more details and specific support services to be provided by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall be fully responsible for performing one or all of the specific tasks and deliverables described below.
  
Generator sizing from 3000watts thru 3MGW, 
Generators should be 3-phased 
Fitted with orbital gel batteries to minimize hazardous materials 
Generators should have a fuel line quick disconnects to be compatible with our generator inventory, which is the compatibility of a generator unit with a respective fuel tank.  The quick disconnects allow a generator unit to use a variety of fuel tanks (larger/smaller) and not depend necessarily on one specific tank.  Sometimes you have to work with whatever fuel tank is available.  The primary reason for the fuel line quick disconnects is to facilitate handling and installation/de-installation of a generator unit and its accompanying fuel tank.  The entire FEMA generator inventory is equipped with fuel quick disconnects. 
Generators should be fitted with lifting aids such as forklift stirrups and/or lifting eye for crane/cherry picker lift capability.  Trying to handle, maneuver, install/de-install a generator without the forklift stirrups and or lifting eye usually results in physical damage to the generator.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals or a request for quotations, it is strictly a Request For Information (RFI).  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers, will be considered in response to this RFI.  No contract will be awarded as  a result of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for costs associated with developing a response to this RFI.  No other information is available to respondents. BACKGROUND 1. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)) is responsible for the management of the Military Health System (MHS).  The MHS is a $33 billion dollar per year enterprise that provides operational medicine, training, researc h, and Force Health Protection support across the full range of military operations.  It also delivers health care for the systems 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries through TRICARE direct and managed care programs.  The transformation of the MHS has been  ongoing and significant.  Recent initiatives have led to the development of a comprehensive strategic and annual business planning process, new purchased care contracts, a streamlined regional TRICARE management structure, and formulary and Federal pricin g for pharmacy services.  As a part of the ongoing MHS Transformation effort, the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) identified a number of initiatives needed to further improve system effectiveness and efficiency.  The Innovation Investment Process (IIP) is  one of these major initiatives.  The IIP is a process by which organizations within the MHS can expeditiously obtain funding for projects that reduce the cost of health care to the MHS.  The IIP will be capable of sponsoring large-scale innovations requir ing an initial investment of capital; successful innovations will return their initial investment to the IIP over multiple fiscal years.  Each investment will be based upon a sound business case analysis, as determined by a Board of Directors. 2.  The MHS TRICARE system delivers health care through a worldwide network of over 70 inpatient and 409 outpatient facilities and supplements that care through a series of private sector contracts that provide physician and hospital networks, retail and mail order pharmacy benefits, claims processing, marketing, and medical management.  The TRICARE program provides a triple option benefit, including Prime (a Health Maintenance Organization-style benefit requiring beneficiary enrollment to a Primary Care M anager (PCM)), Extra (a Preferred Provider Organization-style benefit); and Standard (a fee-for-service benefit).  Beneficiary program eligibility, availability, and costs are based on beneficiary category and location.  Notwithstanding inherent difference s in service availability among locations, the MHS strives to achieve a uniform benefit.  A key objective of the Managed Care Support Services contracts is to optimize the healthcare services within the hospitals and clinics operated by the MHS; that objec tive is consistent with the objectives of the IIP. 3.  Funding for the operation of MHS inpatient and outpatient facilities is allocated based on historical budgets.  The MHS is currently implementing a prospective payment system that will change the allocation system to pay prospectively on the value of h ealth care provided.  To determine the prospective payment, MHS inpatient and outpatient facilities are required to build a business plan which projects their annual enrollment and healthcare delivery targets.  The prospective payment system will be fully implemented for covered activities in FY 2008.  Additional activities will be added over the next few years until all healthcare delivery is covered by prospective payment.  Currently, the value of health care is determined by healthcare workload but in th e future, elements of a capitation payment system, as well as quality performance incentives, may be introduced. 4.  The MHS maintains the following systems that provide data on the hea lthcare delivery system and can provide input for IIP business case analyses:  MHS Management Analysis and Reporting Tool (M2)  for population data, inpatient and outpatient workload data, and claims data; and Expense Assignment System IV (EASIV) for facil ity cost data. NOTIONAL CONCEPT 1.  The MHS has little experience with market-based decision making for healthcare system capital investments, but believes that such experience/expertise exists in the private sector.  To implement the IIP, the MHS desires to leverage private sector exper ience and expertise regarding healthcare system capital investment decision making.   2.  The MHS seeks to contract with a firm that has/uses an existing analytic tool that is capable of performing business case analyses, assessing the risk of a proposed initiative, and performing return on investment calculations for healthcare system capi tal investments.  The analysis will also identify potential impacts on medical readiness, access to care, quality of care and will consider the time necessary to implement each proposed initiative. 3.  The analytic tool must be adaptable to account for differences between private sector and MHS delivery systems, such as funding sources, payers, patient population, readiness requirements, medical education, accounting impacts such as taxes and depreci ation, risk apportionment between the MHS hospitals/clinics and the Managed Care Support Contracts, and DOD policies and regulations. 4.  The analytic tool must be capable of evaluating initiatives that are local, regional, or national in scope.   5.  The contractor will have expertise in healthcare investment, be able to work with the MHS to identify IIP opportunities, and will share in the savings associated with initiatives that are approved and adopted by the MHS.  6.  The contractor, through rights or licensing of the adapted analytic tool, will provide the MHS with the capability to continue to use the analytic tool after the expiration of the contract. 7.  The contractor will provide MHS representatives/organizations with training on the use of the analytic tool.  8.  The contractor will work with the MHS to develop plans of action to implement approved IIP initiatives. RESPONSES To be of greatest value, responses should be received by 4:00 p.m.,  June 26, 2006.  Electronic submissions (email with Microsoft Word attachment) are required.  Attachments should be no longer than 20 pages.   Please send responses to kathy.doyle-lehman@det.amedd.army.mil .  Responses should address the following areas:    a.  Questions on the Notional Concept: 1.  Is the notional concept the best way to meet MHS objectives?  Why or why not?   2.  Is the type of IIP analytic tool envisioned by the MHS available in the private sector? 3.  Is it feasible to adapt an existing analytic tool to incorporate the attributes that are unique to the MHS? 4.  If you believe the notional concept is the best way to meet MHS objectives, discuss the personnel and method that you would propose to use to meet those objectives.  If you believe an alternative approach will better meet MHS objectives, discuss that a pproach and the personnel and method that you would propose to use.   5.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude cost for the initial effort (including a proposed alternative approach) and the ongoing licensure/maintenance costs. 6.  Describe any other challenges or special considerations the Government should take into account. b.  Capabilities Statement 1.  Tell us about your organization and its capabilities to meet IIP objectives.  Identify your organizations salient characteristics:  overall qualifications and expertise of the firm; relevant experience with respect to MHS IIP objectives; small or larg e business, for profit or not for profit, university or consortium, etc.   Provide the contract number for any Federal supply schedule contracts held by your organi zation. 2.  You may identify current or prospective teaming partners, their salient characteristics, and relevant experience.   3.  Potential conflicts of interest.  Disclose your past and current contractual relationships with the MHS.  Disclose the past and current contractual relationships with the MHS of your current or prospective teaming partners.  Disclose the past and curre nt clients who have contractual relationships with the MHS.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory as an agent of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to solicit and negotiate with the MEMS Industry Group (MIG) to provide technical support for the MEMS Technology Roadmap and Industry Congress (METRIC) 2006 conference, which will be held in Pittsburgh PA.  The technical requirement for METRIC is access to a wide range of companies and individuals engaged in the technical and business aspects of the MEMS Industry.  These individuals shall, over two days, address specific questions about issues related to MEMS integration.  They shall use the information generated from working groups that will have met numerous times over the summer to produce a body of knowledge to be used in discussion.  Related to METRIC are two sub-projects.  The first is the Cost Assessment Tool.  To complete Phase III, the deliverable from Phase II shall be procured from the contractor and tested by a group of MEMS Industry Group members during the METRIC 2006 conference.   After test, the final tool will become web-enabled by an additional subcontractor and made available to DARPA.  The second sub-project is the Curriculum Development project, which shall be carried out under the supervision of a DARPA appointed consultant.  Using the survey and data already collected by MIG, an analysis and plan to move forward shall be written by the consultant with assistance from the MEMS Industry Group.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractors capable of offering this technology must respond 15 days after publication of this notice and will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete with the proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<RESPDATE>070706
<ARCHDATE>09052006
<CONTACT>Joseph Marina, (309) 782-6777
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential production sources for the SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispenser NSN 1370-01-158-5322. The SUU-25 F/A is used by the Air force on the A-10, F-5, F-15, and F-16 aircraft to store and dispe nse LUU-1, LUU-2, LUU-4, LUU-5 and LUU-19 (target markers and illumination) flares in flight. The SUU-25 F/A dispenser is approximately 14 in diameter by 92 long and holds 8 flares.  It is affixed to the aircraft by means of two suspension lugs and has t wo electrical receptacles.  Eight flares are loaded in the dispenser, two per launch tube (one behind another), and eight  ARD-863 impulse cartridges are loaded in the breech assembly prior to being installed onto the aircraft.  During flight, launch signa ls are initiated from the pilot and sent to the intervalometer (stepper switch), which in turn, sequentially directs the firing pulse to each impulse cartridge in order. The impulse cartridge pressure is directed through a manifold to eject the flare from the aft position. As the flare leaves the launch tube, arming hooks in the dispenser pull the arming cap off of each flare to start the flare actuation timer.  The intervalometer sequences to the second position for the fire pulse to initiate the impulse c artridge behind the flare in the forefront position. This is repeated in each subsequent tube until all of the flares have been dispensed.  The SUU-25 F/A dispenser is a mission critical item and must perform in a wide variety of extreme environmental and loading conditions.  The dispenser must be tested per Specification #SP8020305, Fabrication Specification Dispenser, Flare SUU-25F/A prior to acceptance. The estimated procurement will be for a one time buy in FY07 for a quantity of 61 SUU-25 F/A Flare D ispensers. The SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispenser consists of a wide variety of parts ranging from structural, to mechanical and electrical components.  Many different materials and processes are required to manufacture the dispenser.  Some of the manufacturing pr ocesses are the following: tooling & machining operations, forming, shearing, and shaping of sheet metal, welding/mechanical fastening, electromechanical components, wiring & soldering, metal casting, and plating/painting for corrosion protection. Material s include various metal alloys, polymers, and composites. Potential manufacturers should provide a brief summary of their company size, descriptive information on the company, manufacturing capabilities (equipment, capacities, facilities, critical skills, possessed, quality control system), and past performance on items with similar complexity to the SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispenser. In addition, it is requested that the potential manufacturer answer the following questions: 1. What would be an economical quantit y for the item? 2. What is reasonable schedule for delivery including First Article Testing?  3.  What is ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) Unit Price for the quantity solicited in this notice?  All interested sources are requested to submit responses in writ ing with clear and convincing documentation by close of 30 days after the date posted. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost obligation to the government. The Government at its discretion and without explanation may choose not to purchase all or part of the quantity of the item herein. The Technical Data Package (TDP) is classified per Distribution Statement D-limited distribution. Distribution Statement D means that the TDP cannot be routed via the internet.  Interested parties mu st be registered with the U.S./CANADA Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the Technical Data Package  (see www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  The request must include: Cage Code, Company Name, Address, Phone Number, E-mail  Address, and Point of Contact.   TDP will be mailed via regular U.S. Mail unless request for FEDEX delivery.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Intent to Award Sole-Source Contract for 50M Antenna Mast
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communication Requirements Division (SCRD), Webster Field Annex intends to award sole-source contract for one 50M antenna mast with glass fiber sections and non-metallic parts. The Government anticipates a Firm-Fixed Price type contract, using FAR 13.5 procedures, with Contact Corporation, 150 Fort Collier Rd, Winchester, VA 22603-5775. The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) Code is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 people. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Contact Corporation is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Governments requirements. This acquisition is in support of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Projects. These projects are currently supporting fielded systems and are in the production stage for future requirements. The PSYOPS projects has an ongoing requirement for an antenna mast for use with commercial broadcast equipment and payloads in support of various missions. The Broadcast Antenna Mast must be able to extend to an operating height of at least 164 feet (50m). It must be capable of rapid deployment within and up to an 8-hour period; depending on the type of broadcast antenna configuration, by 4-person team. The antenna mast must be able to be transported on a mobile air transportable trailer or used with transit case portable system, which also requires a retracted, or nested length, not to exceed 25 feet.  The maximum diameter of bottom mast section must not exceed 7.67 inches (195mm).  The antenna and its components must be modular in design; so that the same model will meet both transit case and vehicle-mounted configurations. The total weight of the mast cannot exceed 750 lbs. (341kg). This antenna mast must be able to be utilized in commercial AM, FM, VHF-TV, and UHF-TV frequency bands and must withstand radio frequency (RF) power levels up to 10kW. It also must be capable of supporting antenna configurations and payloads of up to 155 lbs (70kg). Its construction and fabrication shall meet common industry standards; operate in ambient temperatures of -40 to +55 degrees c, humidity of 0-95%, and can be erected in 30mph-sustained winds. Based on the evaluation performed by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communication Requirements Division (SCRD), on Broadcast Antenna Mast Systems, the requested source was found to be the only manufacturer technically acceptable on the basis of size, weight, configuration and interoperability and interchangeability within fielded system. Because this mast must meet these exact specifications to be incorporated with fielded systems, procurement of an alternative product not meeting these specifications would result in substantial duplication of cost.  The reference number for this notice is N00421-06-P-0621. Interested parties may submit capability statements, by 15:30 Eastern Standard Time on 12 June 2006, via fax to Susan Supplee, Contract Specialist, at (301) 995-8670 or via email to susan.supplee@navy.mil. All responsible sources may submit a proposal by 15:30 Eastern Standard Time on 12 June 2006, which shall be considered by the agency. Proposals shall be submitted via fax or e-mail.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include the justification and approval for other than full and open competition, as follows:

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL, OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
IAW FAR 6.303

1.  REQUIRING AGENCY: 65th Civil Engineering Squadron, Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal

2.  NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: Brand Name acquisition for the award of Allen Bradley parts for the Power Plant, Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal.  

3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCYS NEEDS:  
The 65th Civil Engineering Squadron has a requirement for Allen Bradley manufactured items; two (2) 1404DM Display Modules and two (2) 1404M405AENT Master Modules.  

4.  IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

5.  DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:  This requirement can only be met by Allen Bradley parts as the parts are interconnected with each other and also the master computer in the power plant control room.  These parts function with only one type of software which, in turn, communicates with the rest of the power plant related equipment, such as the Allen Bradley Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).  The proper operation of the power plant, and compatibility of its individual components, is vital to the 65 ABW and its tenant units, especially during power outages.  Moreover, this equipment is used to reset defaults on the switchgear cubicle that affects generator runtime performance during said power outages.  

6.  DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE:  The 65 Contracting Squadron will advertise the requirement on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website for thirty (30) calendar days.  

7.  DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:  The 65th Contracting Squadron anticipates multiple competitive quotations for the required Allen Bradley items.  Additionally, the customers personal knowledge and experience with Allen Bradley items will be used to document quoted prices as fair and reasonable.  

8.  A DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS:  As stated above, this requirement is not available for full and open competition.  A GSA Advantage query revealed 21 sources of Allen Bradley manufactured items.  Additionally, a general Internet search revealed an additional five (5) potential sources, plus the customers recommended source.

9. ANY OTHER FACT SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  
None.

10.  A LIST OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:  	
None. 

11.  ACTIONS TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS:  As the governments requirement is for only Allen Bradley manufactured items, the end user will continue to research and uncover additional sources.
