<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to eXMeritus Software, Inc. The estimate cost of this award is $162,000. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Naval Research Laboratory. This procurement is for performing System Accreditation Support and On-Call Technical Support of a Black Red Interface Control (BRIC) System at the Midway Research Center (MRC), Stafford, Virginia, and is a follow-on award to a uniquely qualified source. Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government. To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the progress of the program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay program completion by a minimum of 8 to 10 months and nearly double the cost. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received within (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. POC: Department of the Interior; Attention: Susan Benik, 381 Elden Street - MS2510, Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be faxed to the attention of Susan Benik at (703) 787-1022 or emailed to Susan.Benik@mms.gov. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for continued maintenance support for ABAQUS software. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from ABAQUS East, LLC as the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements.  ABAQUS software is one of the main tools used to perform the required analysis and verification of the dynamic response of aerospace vehicles.  The renewal of the annual maintenance agreement is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released; access to technical support; prompt notification of bugs, and new documentation as it is published.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 2, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Originally synopsized as F09603-04-R-47011P on July 09, 2003.  The Solicitation Number is changed FROM:  F09603-04-R-47011P TO: FA8519-04-R-70111P. Several changes have been made since the original synopsis and are captured in the following information.  This acquisition will be fully competitive using Best Value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation procedures for NSN:  1670-00-820-4896CT, P/N:  50018-001, Noun:  Air Cargo Pallet, Type I, HCU 6/E. This acquisition is for the repair and new production of 463L Cargo Pallets.  Repair will be based upon a work specification and Air Force drawings.  New production will be based upon a military specification and Air Force drawings.  Pallets require repair due to damage incurred during routine loading/unloading, misuse, and improper storage.  New production will replace pallets lost during contingencies and meet increases in requirement.  New production quantities are estimated at 10,000 each for the basic contract period and 7,000 each for each option year. Pallet repair quantities are estimated as follows:  FY 04 – 6,000 EA; FY 05 – 18,000 EA; FY 06 – 14,000 EA; and FY 07 through FY 13 – 12,000 EA per year.   A requirements type contract will be awarded.  The contract will contain a basic award and nine (9) one-year options priced per occurrence based on level of effort for repair and based on firm-fixed pricing for new production. If the contract is awarded to an unproven source, the contractor shall complete a First Article Test (FAT) prior to repairing or producing any pallets. Note:  Notwithstanding the schedule stated in this contract, the provisions of Section 843 of the FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act, may limit the period of this contract to not more than five (5) years.  If this limitation is subsequently determined to apply, the Government shall have the unilateral right to restructure this contract.  The contract will be restructured to have a basic period and four, twelve month option periods.  The rates included in the current contract will not be changed based on this restructuring and the application of the limitation shall not entitle the contractor to an equitable adjustment.  Also, the repair part of this acquisition falls under the Service Contract Act (SCA).  A wage determination for locality of the successful offeror will be incorporated into the contract.  If work is performed in the United States, the workforce will have to be paid no less than the minimum wage on the Wage Determination.  If you would like to look at the wage determination for your locality, please go to www.WDOL.gov.  It is important that you contact buyer Cyndi Brinkley by e-mail Cyndi.Brinkley@robins.af.mil, if you are interested in this acquisition.  Please plan to provide the following information:  Company Name, Cage Code, Place of Performance, and state if you are under an existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).  Even if you contacted the buyer from the initial synopsis, it is imperative that you make contact again and provide the requested information to be sure a Wage Determination (WD) is included in the RFP for your locality. Data will be available. This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only U.S. contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose. U.S. contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with their request for solicitation.  To obtain certification, contact:  Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN:  U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800) 352-3572.  The DLIS United States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at:  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal/. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation; request a solicitation from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  
Estimated Milestones are changed to:  The approximate issue date of a draft solicitation is 18 Dec 03 with comments due from industry on 20 Jan 04.

Submittals received after this date and time are considered to be late and will not be considered in the selection of A-E firms under this announcement.  Small business firms are encouraged to participate.   The Government anticipates awarding at least fifty percent of the contracts to highly qualified HUBZone firms, i.e., if five contracts are awarded, at least three firms are expected to be HUBZone businesses or if six contracts are awarded, at least three firms are expected to be HUBZone businesses.    Firms are advised that as required by the FAR 52.219-9, a large business successful offeror will be required to submit for approval, a subcontracting plan outlining which portions of the work to be subcontracted will be awarded to small businesses, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses.  This plan is not required with the submission of the SF 254s and SF 255s, but an acceptable subcontracting plan must be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business.  After the basic contracts have been awarded, a specific project will be awarded as a task order under the basic contract to the most highly qualified firm as determined by the A-E Evaluation Board using the selection criteria listed above.  Additional information may be required at that time from the A-E’s awarded a contract to ensure the most highly qualified firm is selected.  Additional information relative to the above specific projects is not available and requests for same will not be considered.  Site visits will not be arranged during the submittal period.  Primary NAIC is 541330 and 541310 but other NAICs in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services may be applicable for a specific project. All response are to be sent to:  Department of Homeland Security; Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; 1131 Chapel Crossing Road; Glynco, GA 31524; Attn:  Gail Ashurst; Procurement Division; Bldg. 93.  The Contracting Officer for this project is Gail Ashurst, who may be contacted at 912-267-3176.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado - Boulder, Office of Contract & Grants to investigate the feasibility of using randomly arranged antennas to form an effective array for communication and signal detection. Typically, antenna arrays are intentional sets of known antennas that have been optimized in both geometry and excitation to achieve design goals. This effort is to examine whether unintentional antennas (random metal objects) can be made into a usable array through an as yet to be determined optimization routine. The goal is to take advantage of metallic objects at a site to improve communication potential (e.g., communication deep into a building, into debris, etc.). The specific work will begin with a review of the literature to identify any related work. Based on findings, an initial simplified "random" array is to be identified and analyzed (possibly randomly oriented and spaced linear antennas).  The Electrical Engineering (EE) Department of the University of Colorado has the unique experience and capabilities required for this project.  This simplified acquisition (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.  No solicitation is available.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than January 6, 2004  and will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive procurement process will be in the Government's best interest.  FAR provisions in full text are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ including requirements for registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Inquiries or responses should be submitted in writing to Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, via email at doris.p.turner@noaa.gov or by fax at 303-497-3163.  The anticipated award date is January 9, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado - Boulder, Office of Contract & Grants to investigate the transmission of RF signals into buildings.  A key aspect is to review methods both to measure and to predict signal propagation into buildings. Some data exist in the literature, but are not collected into a form accessible to non-technical users (e.g., police, fire, first responders). This effort will collect existing data and generate new data where needed. Measurements will investigate propagation through single layers to provide verification of simple analytical models. Measurements will then investigate propagation into actual buildings to gain insight into the variability of signal penetration due to structure geometry, ground effects, additional scatterers (pipes, gutters, etc.), apertures (windows, doors, etc.), and other real world effects. Modeling efforts will consider similar complications.  The Electrical Engineering (EE) Department of the University of Colorado has the unique experience and capabilities required for this project.  This simplified acquisition (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.  No solicitation is available.

Civil and Sanitary Architect/Engineering Services for water systems and wastewater systems, including design, contract document preparation, engineering reports, independent design review, construction technical assistance, troubleshooting, project design management, securing approvals for designs from State and other agencies, and other similar work.  As support for these services, provide Electrical Engineering for power systems and control systems (both electromechanical and PC based) and Mechanical Engineering.  Expertise in green energy design and development, such as recycled products, photovoltaics, fuel cells, wind or hydro power, along with firm location near where the actual project will take place, would be advantageous.  The engineer of record shall be a professional engineer in the area of emphasis appropriate for the work defined in the task order.

Typical water and wastewater systems are small and not the usual municipal system.  Often they are in remote locations, seasonally operated and lack commercial power or phone.  They serve campgrounds, day use areas, visitor centers, maintenance facilities, employee housing, offices, warehouses and air tanker bases.  The size of facilities served may be as small as one single family residence or may be as large as a site with multi-family housing, offices, warehouse and a work center.  The complexity of the water systems ranges from simple groundwater wells and springs with a storage tank to the more complex surface sources with a water treatment plant.  Wastewater systems range from onsite residential primary treatment and disposal (such as septic tanks, disposal trenches and lagoon systems) to more advanced treatment processes required for nitrogen removal at the air tanker bases.

Project locations are on or near National Forests in both eastern and western Oregon and Washington states.  The Forest Service intends to award to a mix of firms to assure even distribution of work.  This solicitation will result in multiple awards of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for three years.  Submit SF 254 and SF 255 to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 10600 NE 51st Circle, Vancouver, WA 98682; attn:  Yvonne J Sterud, Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>QUESTIONS RECEIVED AND ANSWERS RFQ 32998 December 17, 2003 (1)	Question: Is one repair shop in the continental U.S. sufficient?  Answer: No, one repair shop in the continental U.S is not sufficient. The SOW states firm requirements for repair center support also in Europe and Korea. This eliminates avoidable delays and the inherent cost associated with shipping equipment from Europe and Korea to the continental U.S and back.  (2)	Question: Is the price based on incident, flat rate, or time and materials?  Answer: The pricing is based on per repair incident with 90 day warranty after repair incident. It is a firm fixed price (flat rate). It is not time and materials contract.  (3)	Question: Can we increase the cost yearly as our escalation costs increase?  Answer: Other than the standard inflation yearly rate, the SOW specifies fixed maintenance rates requirements per year.  (4)	Question: Can we bid on the printer repair only? Answer: It is not acceptable to propose repair printers only. The SOW requires contractor to provide maintenance for all equipment.

<DESC>12/18/2003 - This amendment is being issued to address questions received concerning Solicitation DG133F-04-RQ-0026.
Question 
How should the bidders fill out the "amount" column on the second page of SF 1449?  The form specifies the quantity as 0, so what should go in the amount column?
Answer:
Each CLIN is a unit which includes training for one 3-day, and one 4-day session priced separately in the description.  The unit price should include the total of the 3 and 4 day sessions.  The quantity is (1).  

Question:
Should bidders submit a price for Task 2?
Answer:
Yes.  Include CLIN 0006 to price Task 2.

Clarify the sentence on page 4.  "The quoter's price will be evaluated based on price per class per region in the totality of unit prices by the number of expected courses."
Answer:
The Government estimates two courses per region; however, the minimum requirement is one.  Your price will be evaluated on the total unit prices submitted.

Question:
The RFP indicates that NOAA has hired NEPA trainers in the past.  Since those contracts are matters of public record, would you tell us who those contractors were?
Answer:
This solicitation is an effort to consolidate all NEPA training for Fisheries.  Previously, each region was responsible for contracting its own training services, which was accomplished by issuing purchase orders.
THE END.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, requires contractor services to provide National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Training.  The Delivery of training cocurs in lecture and workshop formats accordingg to curriculums designed to incorporate marine fisheries activities and issues.

<SUBJECT>R -- Support to Perform Advanced Terrorist Threat Analysis of TSA Job Candidates and Employees
<SOLNBR>HSTS02-04-R-CPO039
<RESPDATE>122303
<ARCHDATE>01072004
<CONTACT>Jim Thompson, Contracting Officer, Phone 571.227.1600, Fax 571.227.1948, Email j.thompson@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks support from a contractor (or contractor team) to perform advanced terrorist threat analysis (TTA) of TSA job candidates and employees, and other persons as necessary.  The analysis should be able to confirm an individual’s identity using public records data, and use that confirmed identity to provide insight and information as to whether the individual presents a potential terrorist threat or has possible connections to potential terrorists.

This analysis will require little subjectivity: if there is a “hit,” e.g., someone is found to be on a list or other data source, or a connection is shown between a subject and someone on a list or other data sources, that finding is flagged and analyzed immediately.  This analysis will be enhanced by the ability to confirm an individual’s identity through the use of extensive public records data.  This data will also be used as the input for the analysis; such extensive data can be utilized because of the relatively small size of the population to be checked (when compared to the traveling public, for example).

Dangerous terrorists may be known to Law Enforcement and Intelligence Community (LE/IC) agencies, and be included on various watch lists and other data sources available to TSA.

These terrorists, and others not known to LE/IC agencies and therefore not on watch lists or other data sources, are also likely to try to achieve relative obscurity by constructing typical lifestyles on U.S. soil.  In so doing, they will develop an “electronic footprint” of publicly available information that can be acquired and used as a key input for TTA.

Other terrorists who have not been able to establish a significant or useful electronic footprint may still be identified by TTA because of the lack of a footprint, and/or by other information provided to Federal agencies including, but not limited to, their planned U.S. destination upon entry into the country.

TSA seeks a contractor with TTA capability that will enable comparisons of biographic and other extensive publicly available information on TSA job candidates and employees, and other persons as necessary, to similar information sets on potential terrorist threats who are included on LE/IC and open source terrorist and classified watch lists, as well as those identified by the analysis itself.

TSA will provide the contractor with the information needed (e.g., name, Social Security Number, and birth date) to conduct the TTA.  If necessary, TSA will provide the contractor with copies of databases or access to databases when those databases are to be used and/or updated during the course of this contract.    

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, equipment, facilities, and perform everything necessary for and incident to the performance of the TTA.

Capabilities Statement

Prior to issuing a request for proposal, TSA is soliciting information from interested contractors on their capability to perform advanced TTA.  

Interested parties should submit a capabilities statement, not exceeding ten (10) pages that addresses the following:

A)  Identify two (2) contracts of similar scope and magnitude that your company performed as prime contractor.  Similar scope and magnitude is defined as nationwide implementation of a system covering at least 30,000 employees requiring specialized background investigation analysis.  Provide the name of the customer(s), names(s) of the point of contact, with telephone number.  Identify whether it was a Government of commercial entity.

B)  General corporate capabilities, to include, but not limited to: length of time in business; number of employees; locations nationwide;  and IT capability.  


In addition to the above, contractor must submit documentation that verifies the following requirements.  This required information is excluded from the ten (10)-page limitation for the capabilities statement above.

(1)	The contractor’s facility must be authorized for the storage and retention of TOP SECRET information.  The contractor must submit certification to demonstrate that the facility where the TTAs will be performed has met all standards for safeguarding TOP SECRET information.
(2)	The contractor must have high-speed computers that are capable of encrypting information prior to transmission and decoding encrypted information.    
(3)	Personnel at the facility who will have access to the TOP SECRET data must have a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation or have received a Government TOP SECRET Security clearance within the last five years.  The contractor is to identify the number of these individuals and, for each, identify the extent to which the individual has the computer skills necessary to electronically conduct TTA analyses.  Government provided documents may be identified as "no-forn" distribution/dissemination.
(4)	Reserved.
(5)	The contractor must provide TSA with information to document that the contractor has a history of successfully implementing highly similar projects in terms of scope, complexity, and sensitivity.  TSA is particularly interested in having the contractor demonstrate the capability to conduct at least 30,000 TTAs in 120 days.  In addition, contractor should demonstrate the capability to complete each TTA in less than twelve (12) hours. 
(6)	The contractor is to provide TSA with a list of the public records the contractor plans to use to verify an individual’s identity and to obtain additional biographic information about the individual for use in the TTA analysis (e.g., former addresses, places of employment, etc.).

A Government Team will evaluate the capabilities statements and supporting documents received and will determine which submissions meet the Government’s need/requirement, as stated above.  The Government reserves the right to contact customers provided by respondents to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation regarding past performance.  Contractors who meet the TSA’s minimum need/requirement will receive the full solicitation package.  Any contractor who fails to demonstrate that they meet the TSA’s minimum need/requirement may be excluded from any further consideration and the Government reserves the right to consider any contractors that it determines to be in the Government's best interest.  Responses must be submitted via email to j.thompson@dhs.gov and holly.bolger@dhs.gov or facsimile to 571-227-1948.  

Responses are due by 4:00 pm Eastern time on Tuesday, December 23, 2003.

This modification also further modifies the STRIFE Amendment to make the following clarifications.  (1)  Section C, paragraph (1):  In reference to the AFRL BAA and PRDA Industry Guide recommended in this paragraph, please note that, as the Guide states, where it differs from the BAA (i.e., STRIFE Amendment), the BAA should be followed.  The Guide is just that--a guide, and is not law or statute.  (2)  Section C, paragraphs (2) and (4):   The definition of Past and Present Performance should be broadened to include relevant product/program information as well as the other information stated in the BAA.  Although Past and Present Performance information may properly be included or alluded to in the Technical Proposal, and its page count, a list of pertinent contracts, experience, points of contact, phone numbers, etc., and any resumes, should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the 50-page count of the Technical Proposal.  The Appendix should be delivered to Trisha Brinton or Carol Abbott not later than close of business, 6 Jan 04.  Section C, paragraph (4) is also modified to require, in addition to One original and 5 paper copies, one copy of both the Technical and Cost Proposals on disk or CD.

The anticipated range for each task order is between $50,000 and $500,000 with most task orders falling in the range of $150,000 to $300,000.

<CONTACT>Melissa McPherson Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.McPherson@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541690 ?Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services?.  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern. PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The proposed study would conduct coral reef monitoring activities to continue a series of previous monitoring efforts developing a long-term database related to the environmental health of the East and West Flower Garden Banks.  Specific objectives of this study are to detect any subtle, chronic effects from natural and man-induced activities that could potentially endanger community integrity.  The total performance period of this study is estimated at two (2) years.  Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the fields of coral reef ecology, marine benthic and fisheries biology, and physical and chemical oceanography.  This experience must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge of the ecology of the Flower Garden Banks (FGB), experience in scientific SCUBA diving at the FGB, and knowledge of all anthropogenic activities potentially affecting the FGB are also required.  The monitoring team must be capable of conducting a rigorous sampling routine at a remote location offshore using scientific diving methods to depths up to 130 ft.  Monitoring methods shall be consistent with past MMS monitoring at the Flower Garden Banks.  Techniques are similar to most all other coral reef monitoring studies.  Observations shall be made to evaluate coral colonies, fish communities, and general community health.  Core samples of coral substrate must be collected to evaluate accretionary growth.  Collected data shall also include videotapes; still photography; water quality; and surveys of coral, selected invertebrates, and fish.  Water samples shall be collected and continuously recording water quality instrumentation shall be maintained at least four (4) times each year.  Samples and data shall be analyzed for a variety of parameters.  A proven data management plan will be needed to ensure high quality data, lines of custody, archival, distribution, and submittal to accepted data repositories.  Collected data shall be interpreted and synthesized with other existing data and knowledge of the Gulf of Mexico to develop a final synthesis report.  Publication of findings in peer reviewed scientific literature is essential.  Descriptions of previous monitoring studies conducted by MMS can be found on the following web pages: http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/flow_gar/flowgard.html http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/techsumm/rec_pubs.html SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm?s ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting monitoring projects of similar scope and complexity and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 3:00 pm Eastern Time on January 2, 2004.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF GAINING INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL QUALIFIED SOURCES RELATIVE TO NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE 561210, SIZE STANDARD: $30M.  RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  REQUIREMENT:  NASA-Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement to procure services in support of ARC's Environmental Service Program.	The functional areas to be supported under this requirement include:  ·	   Environmental Compliance & Hazardous Waste Management · Pollution Prevention and Sustainability ·	   Wildlife and Habitat Conservation and NEPA Compliance · Site Investigation and Restoration ·	 Environmental Management Systems The contractor will be required to provide services in all disciplines listed above.  A complete description of the above functional areas is available in the Statement of Requirements (SOR). BACKGROUND: From 1993 through 1999, the Environmental and Safety Programs were split and two contracts were awarded: 1) The Medical Services was awarded as a CPFF/LOE type contract and 2) the Occupational Safety, Industrial Hygiene and Environmental portion was awarded as a CPAF type contract.    The decision to award the follow-on requirement to one contractor was determined to be a more cost effective approach to managing the programs. As a result, the procurement was competed, and awarded to PAI Corporation, a SDB, Woman-Owned, CPAF contract. It was awarded in March 2000 through March 2005.   The period of performance includes a 3-year base period and one, 2-year option period. The estimated cost is $38.6M.	Due to internal restructuring, transition of resources and budget constraints, ARC believes that splitting the requirements once again into two separate contracts for this next follow-on effort, is the best approach to managing the resources in today's economy, while opening the procurement up to a broader range of competitive sources. Safety Services will be posted under a separate sources sought announcement.  ARC contemplates awarding a performance-based Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Contract for a period of five (5) years; a 2-year basic period, one, 2-year option period and one, 1-year option period. Requirements will be requested on Contract Task Orders (CTOs) issued under the basic contract.  Offerors having the specialized qualifications and capabilities outlined in the SOR, should submit a capability statement in 5 pages or less, to Ms. Wendy Takeguchi, Contract Specialist, Mail Stop 241-1, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000 no later than 6:00PM EST, January 14, 2004. Reference RFP2-38288 on all correspondence.  Qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement under Full and Open Competition Procedures. Responses should contain the following information:  1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website   2) Size of business; Large, Small, Disadvantaged, HUB Zone, 8(a), or Woman-Owned for NAIS code 561210, size standard $30M, number of years in business, affiliate information; parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime) 3) Company capabilities in the 5 functional areas as they relate to the SOR.  In responding to this element, please create a table, as described below:  a)  List the following functions; Environmental Compliance & Hazardous Waste Management, Pollution Prevention and Sustainability, Wildlife and Habitat Conservation and NEPA Compliance, Site Investigation and Restoration, and Environmental Management Systems, then provide the number of years experience your company has in that functional area. 4) Relevant work performed in the past five (5) years. Include contract number and contract type, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, customer/POC information: name, phone number and e-mail address. Also include relevant work in collaboration with the Environmental community and work that facilitates working partnerships within the industry, as well as relevant experience in the California regulatory environment. 5) Please include any comments you have on the SOR. All questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax). Telephone calls will not be accepted.  No solicitation exists. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps and the NASA Acquisition Internet Service under RFP2-38288. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation and other documents relating to this procurement.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, and is not a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  Failure to respond to this synopsis does not preclude a firm from submitting a proposal at a later date.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought notice. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking sources that are capable of providing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) high-resolution coastal surveillance radar (HRCSR). This HRCSR will be a potential replacement or new installation for use in the Coast Guard’s Vessel Traffic Service and similar surveillance/safety systems. The anticipated life cycle of this radar is 5-10 years. The Contractor will not be required to install the radar. Because of the locations of the radar sites and the targets of interest, the HRCSR must be a high-resolution radar. It must have a horizontal beam width of 0.45 degrees or less. Minimum peak power must be 20,000 watts. Circular polarization of the transmitted signal must be an available option. Dual transmitter/receivers must be an available option. Narrow pulse widths and high pulse repetition frequencies are highly desirable. The radar may be operated at unmanned sites making high reliability essential. It must be able to operate continuously in a marine environment. The radar must output analog radar video, trigger, azimuth changes pulses and azimuth repetition pulses. Additionally, the HRCSR must be a complete unit to include the antenna, gearbox, transmitter/receiver(s), and any required power supplies. The HRCSR will be integrated into the U.S. Coast Guards Vessel Traffic Service (CGVTS) and Joint Harbor Operation Center/Integrated Maritime Command Center (JHOC/IMCC) systems. Integration into these systems will utilize SSR Engineering’s PCRP radar processor.  All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis and shall be considered by the USCG. Telephone or written inquiries in reference to this sources sought synopsis will not be accepted. Information provided by responsible sources shall not constitute a proposal and no award will be made from this notice. The Government does not intend to pay for the information received.

<DESC>The Department of State (DOS) has a continuing requirement to provide vehicle barriers to U. S. Diplomatic and Consular Missions overseas that have been certified to a specific level of anti-ram protection. Although the DOS has established a qualified manufacturers list (QML), DOS wants to continue to promote competition by increasing the number of qualified anti-ram vehicle barrier manufacturers. Hence, the following information is provided to interested manufacturers. Prior to DOS certification, vehicle barriers must be tested by an independent crash test facility to meet DOS standards. 
The standards and requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified are found in the following documents: Department of State (DOS) standard, SD-STD-02.01 (Revision A), Specification for Vehicle Crash Test of Perimeter Barriers and Gates and 12 FAH 5, Foreign Affairs Handbook. The specifications for these products are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of this qualification requirement. At a minimum, each manufacturer must have one vehicle barrier tested and certified by DOS prior to any award of contract. All requests for copies of these specifications and standards must be in writing and submitted to U.S. Department of State, DS/PSP/PSD, Attn: Dusty Rhodes, SA-14, Washington DC 20520-1403, with an information copy attached for A/OPE, Rm. 603, SA-6, Washington, DC 20522-0602.   Mr. Rhodes may be contacted at (703) 312-3144.

When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin.  The manufacturer is responsible for arranging, scheduling and paying for the tests conducted by an independent facility that has been approved by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Physical Security Programs, Physical Security Division (DS/PSP/PSD). The following test facilities have been approved for certification testing: Karco Engineering & Research Center, 9270 Holly Road, Adelanto, CA 92301, phone (760) 246-1672, MGA Research Corporation, 5000 Warren Road, Burlington, WI 53105, phone (414) 763-2705, Texas Transportation Institute, Texas A&M University System, 3135 TAMU, College Station, TX 77843-3135, phone (979) 845-6159, Transportation Research Center, Inc., St. Rt.33, Logan County, East Liberty, Ohio 43319-0367, phone (937) 666-2011, Veridian Engineering Division, 4455 Genessee St., Buffalo, NY 14225, phone (716) 632-7500,  Pennsylvania Transportation Institute, Pennsylvania State University, 201 Transportation Research Building, University Park, PA  16802-4710,  phone (814) 865-1891 and Midwest Roadside Safety Facility, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, 1901 Y Street, Bldg C, Lincoln, NE 68588, phone (402) 472-6864.

<DESC>The Department of State (DOS) has a continuing requirement for providing doors, windows, opaque panels and glazing panels to U. S. Diplomatic and Consular Missions overseas that have been DOS certified for forced entry (FE) and ballistic resistant (BR) protection. The DOS has established a qualified manufacturers list (QML) but DOS wants to continue to promote competition by increasing the number of qualified manufacturers for our FE/BR requirements. Hence, the following information is provided to interested manufacturers. Prior to DOS certification, each product must be tested by an independent test facility to meet DOS standards for a specified level of FE and BR protection. We currently utilize the following different FE/BR ratings: 5-minute FE, 15-minute FE/BR and 60-minute FE/BR. Products required for 5-minute FE protection include: doors with glazing panels, opaque doors, opaque door pairs, door pairs with glazing panels, fixed windows and teller windows with deal tray. Products required for 15-minute FE/BR protection include: doors with glazing panels, doors with glazing panel and deal tray, opaque doors, opaque door pairs, door pairs with glazing panels, fixed windows, teller windows with deal tray, opaque panels, transparent panels, and combination opaque and transparent panels. Products required for 60-minute FE/BR protection include: opaque doors, opaque door pairs, louvers and roof hatches. The standards and requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified are found in the following documents: Department of State (DOS) standard, SD-STD-01.01 (latest revision), Certification Standard for Forced Entry and Ballistic Resistance of Structural Systems, and requirements provided in the Office of Foreign Buildings Operations (FBO) Architectural & Engineering Design Guidelines for U. S. Diplomatic Mission Buildings Master-Guide-Spec, Section 08318 - Forced Entry (FE)/Ballistic Resistant (BR)Door Assemblies, Section 08661 - Exterior Security Windows, Section 08667 - Interior Security and Teller Windows, Section 08845 - Security Glazing, Section 13026 - Security Modular Panels, Section 10211 - Security Louvers, and Section 07727 - Forced Entry (FE)/Ballistic Resistant (BR) Roof Hatches. The specifications for these products are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of this qualification requirement. At a minimum, each manufacturer must have the following 15-minute FE/BR products tested and DOS-certified prior to any award of contract: door with glazing, opaque door, door with glazing panel and deal tray, fixed window, and teller window with deal tray. It is extremely difficult to mix manufacturers on one project due to different appearance, frame materials, finish materials and coordination of bolt holes if two different manufacturers frames are to bolted together. Therefore for large projects we would utilize one manufacturer for all products unless the products are not physically located in close proximity to distinguish physical differences.   All requests for copies of these specifications and standards must be in writing and submitted to U.S. Department of State, DS/PSP/PSD, Attn: Dusty Rhodes, SA-14, Washington DC 20520-1403 with an information copy attached for A/OPE, Rm. 603, SA-6, Washington, DC 20522-0602.  Mr. Rhodes may be contacted at (703) 312-3144. The DOS has awarded contracts subject to this qualification requirement since fiscal year 2000. When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin. The manufacturer is responsible for arranging, scheduling and paying for the tests conducted by an independent laboratory that has been approved by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Physical Security Programs, Physical Security Division (DS/PSP/PSD). The following test facility has been approved for certification testing: H.P. White Laboratory, Inc., 3114 Scarboro Road, Street, Maryland 21154-1822, (410) 838-6550.

<RESPDATE>012204
<CONTACT>DONA APGAR, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3271
<DESC>CBD ANNOUNCEMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL SMALL ARMS CENTER SIGNING DAY  HISTORY In May 2002, NDIA Small Arms Symposium presented a paper on the  concept of a National Small Arms Center.  In January 2003, there was an  Industry Day at The Hilton Hotel.  Approximately 100 Industry, government, and  academia representatives attended.  A draft Other Transaction and Consortium  Member Agreement was presented to Contracting and Legal office for review.   >From preliminary data it appears as though there is enough interest to have a  signing day for those entities interested in being a part of this consortium.  PURPOSE  Signing day for industry and academia to become provisional members of  an industry/academia consortium.  The Consortium is the private sector partner  of a National Small Arms Center sponsored by the U.S. Army and other Defense  and Government organizations.   The  major goal of this Consortium and Center  is to improve the U.S. technology & Production base capabilities as required   to sustain U.S. military supremacy in research, development, engineering and  production of small arms weapons and ammunition, to include hand guns, shoulder  fired weapons, grenade launchers, machine guns, grenade machine guns,  and  advanced weapons/devices such as lightweight acoustic and directed energy  weapons.  Also, included are small arms ammunition; gun launched and rocket  grenades; fire control; embedded computers; power supplies; fuzing;  the  soldier/gun/vehicle interface and related materials and processes   BACKGROUND  The small arms weapons and ammunition technology base and industrial base are  in serious jeopardy due to a long period of reduced Defense spending and the  restructuring and downsizing of Government, industry and university  capabilities.  Conventional small arms weapons and ammunition technologies are  core capabilities which must be sustained to meet our military needs around the  world.  The National Small Arms Center is under the management of the Program  Manager for the Joint Services Small Arms Program and is cosponsored by the PEO  Soldier; PEO Ammunition; U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command - Rock  Island (TACOM-RI), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)  and the Armaments  Research and Development Engineering Center(ARDEC).  The other Services and  other Government agencies are invited to join the Center by this announcement  and separate correspondence.  The management of the Center will be located at  ARDEC although in operation the center is a virtual center that will leverage  the assets and capabilities of its Government sponsors and industry and  academia partners.  ARDEC serves as the Army's focal point and authority for  research, development, test and evaluation of small arms weapons system  designs, optimization of lethality, durability, reliability and ease of use;  and development and application of computer models and simulations to all  aspects of weapons system design.  ARDEC is also the Department of the Army and  the Army Materiel Command's lead laboratory for energetic materials and for  transitioning small arms weapons and ammunition to production.  The sponsors  have partnered and continue to partner with a number of universities and  private sector companies on many diverse activities in the areas of Small Arms  Weapons Systems.  The Army would like to build upon this partnering activity  with academia, industry and other profit and non-profit organizations to  address the Army's long range goals in the area of small arms weapons systems.  DESCRIPTION The partnership/consortium will perform research, development and  engineering activities which address the Army's long range goals in the areas  indicated above.  The role of this consortium is to define collaborative  efforts that advance the technology and scientific and engineering skills in  the areas that are required to develop, upgrade and produce weapons and  ammunition which support the Army's current and future requirements.  The role  of the Government will be to directly participate in these collaborative  efforts, to provide partial or full funding, and share expertise and  facilities.  It is expected that the non-Government collaborators will share in  the funding of projects for the National Small Arms Center on a case-by-case  basis, contribute their own personnel resources in planning and organizing  collaborative efforts and under special instances provide materials,  facilities, equipment or instrumentation.  It is envisioned that these  objectives will be accomplished through the use of an “Other Transaction  Agreement (OTA)" for prototyping (Section 845 of the 1994 Defense  Appropriations Act and amendments) between the Army and the consortium, where  each consortium member participates in accordance with a Consortium Management  Agreement (CMA).  The CMA will  define the purpose, goals and responsibilities  of the members including how the members will address intellectual property.   The consortium will consist of industry (large and small businesses),  universities, and non-profit organizations working with PM JSSAP (Joint Service  and Small Arms Program) personnel and other Government sponsors utilizing their  own facilities or ARDEC laboratories and facilities on a fee for service  basis.  The level of funding from the Government is estimated to be $1.5M -  $3.0M the first year.  The term of the agreement is expected to be for a least  5 years with provisions for renewal.  Inasmuch as this consortium is to improve  and sustain U.S. military supremacy in the research, development, engineering  and production of small arms weapons and ammunition, the Consortium will be  open to qualified U.S. and foreign-owned organizations to foster the largest  technical impact.  The members may need a Secret clearance, and will need to  comply with U.S. Army Security, safety and environmental requirements and  export laws.  There is a preference for the work to be performed in the U.S.  whether by U.S. or foreign-owned organizations.  The Center will engage in  broad areas of research and development leading to prototypes to include weapon  systems, subassemblies such as fire control, fuzing and power supplies,  materials and material behavior, coatings, manufacturing science and  technology, modeling and simulation and failure analyses.  The Center will also  foster specialized education and training as necessary consistent with the  goals of the Center.  Status   A request to use the Other Transactions  Authority has been submitted to the Department of the Army for approval.  The  draft CMA will be available NLT January 2, 2004 for review by perspective  members on the NDIA web site (www.ndia.org, click on divisions, click on  armaments, click on small arms, scroll down to find documents and news about  the center).  Comments, questions or suggestions on the CMA should be e-mailed  to Barbara Byrnes, eme1bmt@aol.com.  ADMINISTRATION  Please respond to this  announcement if you plan to attend the Signing Day scheduled for 5 February  2004 at the Hilton Garden Inn, Rockaway Town Square Mall, Rockaway, NJ NLT 19  January 2004.  Please advise Barbara J. Byrnes, eme1bmt@aol.com, (703) 212-8030  or Dr. Stephen C. Small, ssmall@pica.army.mil (973) 724-7043 of your intent to  attend Signing Day.  Security:  The meeting is unclassified.  The Government  will not pay for attendance (approx. $25 for lunch) nor award a contract based  on your submission or attendance.  The purpose of the meeting is to sign the  charter, standup the Center, and obtain provisional signatures of those  organizations intending to join the Consortium.  IMPORTANT  All foreign nationals must submit an embassy request no later than January 21, 2004.  Canadians may apply by way of the Joint Certification Program.  In either case the security POC is Kevin Perry (973)724-2933.  The Government will not pay for this information nor award a contract based on your submission.  This notice will be used by the Army to have interested parties sign up for membership.

<SUBJECT>Research and Development National Small Arms Center Signing Day
<DESC>CBD ANNOUNCEMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL SMALL ARMS CENTER SIGNING DAY  HISTORY In May 2002, NDIA Small Arms Symposium presented a paper on the  concept of a National Small Arms Center.  In January 2003, there was an  Industry Day at The Hilton Hotel.  Approximately 100 Industry, government, and  academia representatives attended.  A draft Other Transaction and Consortium  Member Agreement was presented to Contracting and Legal office for review.   >From preliminary data it appears as though there is enough interest to have a  signing day for those entities interested in being a part of this consortium.  PURPOSE  Signing day for industry and academia to become provisional members of  an industry/academia consortium.  The Consortium is the private sector partner  of a National Small Arms Center sponsored by the U.S. Army and other Defense  and Government organizations.   The  major goal of this Consortium and Center  is to improve the U.S. technology & Production base capabilities as required   to sustain U.S. military supremacy in research, development, engineering and  production of small arms weapons and ammunition, to include hand guns, shoulder  fired weapons, grenade launchers, machine guns, grenade machine guns,  and  advanced weapons/devices such as lightweight acoustic and directed energy  weapons.  Also, included are small arms ammunition; gun launched and rocket  grenades; fire control; embedded computers; power supplies; fuzing;  the  soldier/gun/vehicle interface and related materials and processes   BACKGROUND  The small arms weapons and ammunition technology base and industrial base are  in serious jeopardy due to a long period of reduced Defense spending and the  restructuring and downsizing of Government, industry and university  capabilities.  Conventional small arms weapons and ammunition technologies are  core capabilities which must be sustained to meet our military needs around the  world.  The National Small Arms Center is under the management of the Program  Manager for the Joint Services Small Arms Program and is cosponsored by the PEO  Soldier; PEO Ammunition; U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command - Rock  Island (TACOM-RI), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)  and the Armaments  Research and Development Engineering Center(ARDEC).  The other Services and  other Government agencies are invited to join the Center by this announcement  and separate correspondence.  The management of the Center will be located at  ARDEC although in operation the center is a virtual center that will leverage  the assets and capabilities of its Government sponsors and industry and  academia partners.  ARDEC serves as the Army's focal point and authority for  research, development, test and evaluation of small arms weapons system  designs, optimization of lethality, durability, reliability and ease of use;  and development and application of computer models and simulations to all  aspects of weapons system design.  ARDEC is also the Department of the Army and  the Army Materiel Command's lead laboratory for energetic materials and for  transitioning small arms weapons and ammunition to production.  The sponsors  have partnered and continue to partner with a number of universities and  private sector companies on many diverse activities in the areas of Small Arms  Weapons Systems.  The Army would like to build upon this partnering activity  with academia, industry and other profit and non-profit organizations to  address the Army's long range goals in the area of small arms weapons systems.  DESCRIPTION The partnership/consortium will perform research, development and  engineering activities which address the Army's long range goals in the areas  indicated above.  The role of this consortium is to define collaborative  efforts that advance the technology and scientific and engineering skills in  the areas that are required to develop, upgrade and produce weapons and  ammunition which support the Army's current and future requirements.  The role  of the Government will be to directly participate in these collaborative  efforts, to provide partial or full funding, and share expertise and  facilities.  It is expected that the non-Government collaborators will share in  the funding of projects for the National Small Arms Center on a case-by-case  basis, contribute their own personnel resources in planning and organizing  collaborative efforts and under special instances provide materials,  facilities, equipment or instrumentation.  It is envisioned that these  objectives will be accomplished through the use of an “Other Transaction  Agreement (OTA)" for prototyping (Section 845 of the 1994 Defense  Appropriations Act and amendments) between the Army and the consortium, where  each consortium member participates in accordance with a Consortium Management  Agreement (CMA).  The CMA will  define the purpose, goals and responsibilities  of the members including how the members will address intellectual property.   The consortium will consist of industry (large and small businesses),  universities, and non-profit organizations working with PM JSSAP (Joint Service  and Small Arms Program) personnel and other Government sponsors utilizing their  own facilities or ARDEC laboratories and facilities on a fee for service  basis.  The level of funding from the Government is estimated to be $1.5M -  $3.0M the first year.  The term of the agreement is expected to be for a least  5 years with provisions for renewal.  Inasmuch as this consortium is to improve  and sustain U.S. military supremacy in the research, development, engineering  and production of small arms weapons and ammunition, the Consortium will be  open to qualified U.S. and foreign-owned organizations to foster the largest  technical impact.  The members may need a Secret clearance, and will need to  comply with U.S. Army Security, safety and environmental requirements and  export laws.  There is a preference for the work to be performed in the U.S.  whether by U.S. or foreign-owned organizations.  The Center will engage in  broad areas of research and development leading to prototypes to include weapon  systems, subassemblies such as fire control, fuzing and power supplies,  materials and material behavior, coatings, manufacturing science and  technology, modeling and simulation and failure analyses.  The Center will also  foster specialized education and training as necessary consistent with the  goals of the Center.  Status   A request to use the Other Transactions  Authority has been submitted to the Department of the Army for approval.  The  draft CMA will be available NLT January 2, 2004 for review by perspective  members on the NDIA web site (www.ndia.org, click on divisions, click on  armaments, click on small arms, scroll down to find documents and news about  the center).  Comments, questions or suggestions on the CMA should be e-mailed  to Barbara Byrnes, eme1bmt@aol.com.  ADMINISTRATION  Please respond to this  announcement if you plan to attend the Signing Day scheduled for 5 February  2004 at the Hilton Garden Inn, Rockaway Town Square Mall, Rockaway, NJ NLT 19  January 2004.  Please advise Barbara J. Byrnes, eme1bmt@aol.com, (703) 212-8030  or Dr. Stephen C. Small, ssmall@pica.army.mil (973) 724-7043 of your intent to  attend Signing Day.  Security:  The meeting is unclassified.  The Government  will not pay for attendance (approx. $25 for lunch) nor award a contract based  on your submission or attendance.

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 	two years

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 			Yerevan, Armenia, Program Office	  

8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:

I. Direct Supervisor:

Director or designee, USAID/Armenia Program Office, who provides both general guidance and specific assignments to the Supervisory Public Information Officer.

II. Supervisory Controls:

The incumbent will have a broad development background and USAID experience; therefore, he/she will independently carry out the functions of this position, based on general procedural guidelines and strategic/policy direction from his/her supervisor.

III.  Introduction:

Armenia is a small, landlocked, mountainous country with few natural resources.  About the size of Maryland (29,800 square kilometers), it is situated in the Caucasus Region, surrounded by Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey.  In September 1991, Armenian voters opted for independence from the Soviet Union.  However, the break-up of the Soviet Union brought an end to the commercial ties and protected markets which had helped make Armenia among the most prosperous of the former Soviet republics. 

Armenia’s early years of independence were characterized by severe economic decline and energy shortages.  This situation precipitated a new humanitarian crisis, while the country was still recovering from the economic and social fallout of the 1988 earthquake, which had left over 25,000 people dead and 500,000 homeless.  To a large extent, the crises that Armenia experienced during the early- to mid-1990’s have abated.  However, political and economic institutions and practices are nascent and progress towards structural reform has been inconsistent.  While there has been positive economic growth in recent years, Armenia has yet to recover to its pre-independence income levels.  Armenia’s internal political landscape remains unstable, and its relations with its neighbors remain problematic.  Finally, there is not an adequate social safety net to meet the basic needs of country’s vulnerable groups, including those who have been negatively impacted by Armenia’s transition process.       

Notwithstanding the above mentioned conditions, since its independence Armenia has emerged as a strategically important republic in the Caucasus, whose progress towards a democratic political order and free market economy is critical to U.S. interests in the region.  Since 1998, USAID has shifted its program emphasis from humanitarian to a longer-term developmental approach to facilitate Armenia’s transition to a free market democracy.  Currently, the Mission has strategic objectives in the following four principal areas: private sector growth, energy sector, democracy/governance and social sectors.  In these areas, the Mission is carrying out an ambitious program that balances the needs for macro-level reform and sustainability with the immediate demands to improve the quality of life of the Armenian populace.  In addition, the Mission has two special objectives—one that addresses water management issues, and another includes regional and politically driven initiatives (e.g., earmark for assistance in the earthquake zone).

Since 1994, USAID/Armenia’s funding has averaged $67 million annually.  In FY 2002, the Mission expects a program budget of approximately $55 million with more that 50 ongoing and new activities. These figures establish Armenia as one of the largest per capita recipients of U.S. assistance in the world.  High political interest by the US Congress, an active and vocal US Diaspora community and an active in country Armenian NGO community make it imperative that results of USAID's program and its successes are widely disseminated. The incumbent's key function will be to manage the flow of information to important USAID stakeholders.  

IV.  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The incumbent will serve as the Supervisory Public Information Officer (SPIO) in USAID/Armenia’s Program Office.  In this capacity, the SPIO will:

The information strategy will reflect the objectives of USAID assistance, integrate information availability into activity planning and execution, and explain how information will be used to show the impact of USAID assistance on the transformation process in Armenia.  The Mission’s information strategy will include mechanisms that encourage alliances with Diaspora organizations.

Maintain knowledge of the inter-relationships and significance of various program components in the process of economic, democratic and social transition in Armenia.  Utilize this knowledge to improve coordination of activities within USAID/Armenia and with other USG agencies.  Advise internal and external stakeholders on aspects of the Mission’s program.

Oversee the development and maintenance of programmatic public relations materials in two languages – English and Armenian – including brochures, Activity Fact Sheets, periodic news letters, video documentaries, visual displays, internet site, etc.  Oversee responses to project proposals and requests for information on USAID/Armenia projects from Armenian Diaspora Organizations in the U.S. and Europe.
