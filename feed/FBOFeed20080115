<DESC>The Capable Manpower (CM) Future Naval Warfighter Capability (FNWC) program office at the Office of Naval Research, is inviting full proposals. These proposals should suggest innovative science and technology developments to overcome the capability gaps described later in this announcement. 

The Capable Manpower Future Naval Warfighter Capability program (CM) is a set of capability-development projects focused on the human performance aspects of the Navy and Marine Corps. CM supports work to further human-systems integration, particularly in the areas of human factors engineering, manpower and personnel, and training. 

In this announcement, the Navy and Marine Corps are seeking the development of innovative technology-based products to enable transformation in their Human Capital programs, targeted at human systems integration (HSI), that enable SYSCOM program managers to optimize total system performance, minimize total ownership costs, and ensure that systems are built to accommodate the characteristics of the user population that will operate, maintain, and support systems, for the warfighting pillars of Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, and FORCEnet. A description of these Sea Power 21 pillars can be found at: http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/proceedings.html. 

Reduced manning and increased mission requirements will demand greater competencies of Naval warfighters than ever before, and also greater synchrony among individual competencies, in teams and in interaction with complex systems. New approaches to performance support and system design are necessary to ensure that future combatants and related sea-service components are adequately staffed and have optimal readiness. 

The Capable Manpower Future Naval Warfighter Capability program is dedicated to development and focused transition of products to the Navy / Marine Corps. Products are new technologies, methodologies, processes, systems, and/or devices, together with evidence of their cost/effectiveness, based on research and development. The goal is to deliver these products to Navy / Marine Corps customers, to improve system design, utilization, training, and performance of Sailors and Marines, enabling significant Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Human Systems cost savings and improved warfighting readiness.

FOR STANLEY VIDMAR STORAGE CABINETS

I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC 27531.

II.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The action required is a Brand Name Fixed Price Contract to purchase a Stanley Vidmar Storage System.  The system is required to provide safe and secure storage of bench stock and other small assets.

III.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The system will be used to support an expected increase in stocked assets in 4 LRS F-15E Aircraft Parts Store (APS).  The request is for Stanley Vidmar modular cabinets of different quantity to include installation.

IV.	AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and 6.302-1(c).

V.	APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  The current storage system in place at the APS is a Stanley Vidmar System and the add-on system is specific to this system.  There are no other storage systems in the market that are compatible.

VI.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  Contractors with similar GSA schedules were contacted (Core Services, Inc., Techni-tool, Inc., A S Custom Furniture Company, and Plug-in Storage Systems, Inc.) revealing that they could not fulfill this requirement. Contacted Stanley Vidmar storage system distributors Miller Industrial, Adams Handling and Dillion Supply and they are interested and capable.

       VII.   FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The anticipated cost is being determined fair and reasonable in accordance with market research.

               system to store these items versus having the ability to consolidate them into a smaller, 
               more compact system.  The additional Vidmar storage cabinets will increase the APS 
               storage capacity by 30% and will allow the extra floor space to be used for heavier, bulk
               type assets.
     
       X.   TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION:  The using activity 
              has certified that the technical requirements and certifications are complete and accurate.

       XI.  CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:  The Contracting Officer?s signature on

Day two will be used to meet individually with potential prime contractors who request a one-on-one session with the Government.  One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 1 hour. The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.

The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.

The nature of the tasking and the limited timeframe of the deliverables requires a Contractor with the first hand knowledge and understanding of ongoing and prior R&D programs associated with Fueling At-Sea (FAS) and shipboard material handling systems, as well as USN and merchant ship design.  Also, this Contractor is not affiliated with any of the other maritime Contractors serving NAVSEA, and can therefore provide the Government an independent evaluation of these other Contractor?s tasking performance and deliverables.  This order requires a Contractor with both the knowledge and understanding of Seabasing related USN R&D programs, and must be able to independ!  ently monitor the performance of other ongoing Navy Contracts.   A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated. Award will be based on the written quotation. FSC is AD96. Anticipated award date will be on or about JAN 31, 2008.  NAICS Code 541330 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure, via Government supplied drawing package, aircraft engine test systems for the purpose of intermediate level testing of turbo-shaft and turbo-prop aircraft engines in either indoor or outdoor environments. These systems will provide US Navy & Marine Corps intermediate maintenance level engine test capability for the H-60, AH-1, H-53, H-3, P3, C130, C2, and E2 aircraft families, and for the US Army: the CH-47, UH-60, and AH-64 aircraft. The engine test systems perform diagnostic troubleshooting along with the functional capability to analyze signals from the engine and fault isolate to the component level. The Navy owns the drawings and test software and will manage configuration.

The Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation system (SETI) and Turboprop Engine Test Instrumentation system (TPTI) interfaces with two major functional elements; the engine under test and the test system or facility. The SETI and TPTI will be operated worldwide at U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Air Stations. The basic system consists of the necessary hardware and software to acquire raw analog and digital engine data, perform signal conditioning and time averaging, perform specific engine performance calculations, and output the data results to a video display, printer and magnetic media. SETI / TPTI also controls the engine operation and ancillary test facility systems such as fuel, dynamometer, and engine lube cooling. Operator Control for this system is via a touch-screen personal computer based upon a Windows 2000 architecture. The single station control system serves more than one engine test program set (TPS). Only the TPS portion of the system will be unique for each engine test.

The major components of the SETI / TPTI  system will be manufactured / procured and installed by the prospective contractor into either a government supplied transportable instrumentation and control cab (ISO type) enclosure, or into a fixed test facility at a Navy aircraft maintenance facility. The major components of SETI / TPTI consist of a data acquisition cabinet, a terminal strip cabinet, the facility and test program set consoles for the operators (which contain the computers, monitors, and engine throttle controls), the electrical/mechanical junction boxes (external to the ISO cab) and the engine adapter assembly, which consists of the cabling and sensors for control and feedback from the engine.

The contractor will provide necessary systems engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the Statement of Work (SOW). 

The required basic quantity is estimated at two (2) Pilot Production Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T700 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T64 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Turbo Prop Engine Test Instrumentation (TETI) Unit, one (1) Pilot Production Model T-33 Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units for the US Army, and up to 48 Production Units. This procurement also includes technical data requirements.

After solicitation release, the government will provide an opportunity for interested offerors to visit a full-scale, mobile SETI engine test system at Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent River, MD. The dates for visits will be provided at solicitation release, and are being conducted in order to help offerors gain an understanding of the component interrelationships, and of the size and scope of this project. Visits will be by appointment only, and will be limited to one hour maximum. There is a limit of 4 persons maximum for each visit group. During the visit, equipment will be described and shown to all prospective companies individually, using the same generalized script. Any questions will be recorded and the answers provided to all offerors using the World Wide Web. All travel, labor, and other expenses incurred in the visit are the responsibility of the offeror. Offerors are not required to attend. 

The Government is anticipating an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Fixed Price type contract.  This procurement will be Full and Open.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select DOING BUSINESS and then OPEN SOLICITATIONS.  Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 1 February 2008.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, China Lake CA, intends to procure on an other than full and open competition basis, a firm fixed price contract for a Customer Relationship Management System/Strategy thats primary purpose is to provide NATEC (United States Naval Air Technical Engineering Command) the ability to make  transactions and dealings with their customers smoother and more efficient by evaluating their processes for chokepoints and other areas needing improvement. To facilitate deployment of NATEC's CRM strategy, a contractor will be required to deliver a roadmap to the future state CRM environment  that lays out a sequence of initiatives to undertake over a 12 month timeframe and design the operational and technical environment for a CRM environment based on the Navy's current infrastructure. This roadmap will incorporate both the logistic management Integration Department 6.8 and Integrated Technical Service Department 6.7 processes/operations into one cohesive structure.  Due to significant time restraints and IBM?s previous work on NATEC's CRM project in the form of a processes gap analysis, IBM has already developed the necessary data for immediate tasking as required by NATEC.   Therefore this requirement is sole sourced to IBM, 6300 Diagonal Hwy., Boulder, Co 80301 because it is the only firm that possesses the detailed technical knowledge, engineering expertise, and technical data for all processes involved.   Any firms believing that they can provide the materials may submit a written response to be received no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the product without causing programmatic hardship.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Award is anticipated on or about 20 March 2008. Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) plans to procure services for the NIMH Chemical Synthesis Drug and Supply Program.

The purpose of the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program is to synthesize, purify, and provide essential compounds that are unavailable from commercial sources to stimulate basic and clinical research relevant to mental health in areas such as the molecular pharmacology and signaling of CNS receptors, longitudinal studies to evaluate the molecular, biochemical, and behavioral actions of psychoactive compounds, and functional brain imaging in primates and humans.  

The objectives of the contract are to synthesize approximately 30 (but could range from 15-40) non-GMP compounds and 2 (but could range from 2-10) GMP compounds per year, as specified by the Government Project Officer (GPO).  Compounds synthesized under the contract could include, but are not limited to, psychoactive drugs, selective ligands for CNS receptor subtypes, ion channel modulators, signal transduction agents, peptides, small molecules, radiolabeled ligands for autoradiography or neuroimaging, chemicals, probes, and synthetic intermediates.  Synthetic projects may also include medicinal chemistry tasks to optimize promising compounds for use as research tools or for clinical applications.

The Contractor will store, maintain, and distribute new and existing compounds in the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program Inventory, including small, plated compound sets. The contract will also maintain an electronic database of compounds with analytical and technical information, as well as an electronic inventory of shipments.  It is anticipated that synthesis requests will be submitted from a variety of sources including NIH-funded research programs, biotechnology companies, small pharmaceutical companies, or other sources.  Services are provided free of cost to academic investigators and at cost to commercial, for-profit entities.  It is expected that the chemicals or drugs synthesized and distributed by this program will provide individual investigators with conceptual leads for basic and clinical studies of the neurobiology and treatment of mental disorders.

The continued use of a deviation to the standard patent rights clause in FAR 52.227-11 Patent Rights ? Ownership by the Contractor (Dec 2007) is being evaluated for this contract, to ensure the confidentiality and protect the intellectual property and patent rights of an investigator or party supplying a proprietary sample of composition of matter for testing under this contract.  The currently approved Patent Rights clause deviation applies to all discoveries resulting from routine pharmacological and functional screening activities involving the use of proprietary compounds.  Discoveries resulting from research activities pertaining to the development of new screening assays or other unanticipated discoveries developed by the Contractor without the use of proprietary compounds is covered by the standard Patent Rights Clause (FAR 52.227-11 Patent Rights - Ownership by the Contractor (Dec 2007)).  The proposed deviated Patent Rights clause will be incorporated in full text in the solicitation, including a Statement of Facts that will further elaborate on why NIMH believes that continued use of this clause deviation is necessary.  However, a separate Special Notice will also be published on or before the date this solicitation is released, which will request public comments and proposed alternatives to the use of this deviated clause, which will be actively considered by NIMH. The solicitation notice and the Special Notice will be cross-referenced in each respective document. 

TENTATIVE SCHEDULE:  Issuance of Request for Proposals on or about 2/22/2008 and Proposal Due Date expected 4/08/2008.  

The acquisition will be conducted using procedures in FAR Part 6, Full and Open Competition; FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations; and other FAR sections applicable to this procurement.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 (500 employees).  The acquisition will result in a cost reimbursable type contract containing a period of performance for three 12-month base years with two 12-month option periods from date of award.  

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  All updates/amendments pertaining to this requirement will only be posted and made available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (Fedbizopps) site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the Offerors responsibility to review this site frequently for updates to any and all documents. 
THIS NOTICE DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE A CONTRACT AWARD FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.

<DESC>*******PLEASE CONTACT DENECE NORRIS FOR QUOTE OR TECHNICAL CONCERNS.  CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION****** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for (1) Ea. of an Edison Welding Institute(EWI) Membership Fee & Friction Stir Welding(FSW) License with a Period of Performance from 10/01/2007 thru 09/30/08. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Edison Welding Institute, Inc. on a sole source basis.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. The EWI is a non-profit, membership-based organization that provides metals joining expertise in the area of welding process selection, optimization, troubleshooting, and research.  The EWI is the largest industrial consortium dedicated to welding in the United States with an estimated $9.0 Million annual applied research program dedicated to metals joining procedures and process development, which makes it the only source with the resources to address critical welding issues.  There are no other organizations in the U. S. which offer these services. 2.  Membership in the EWI will enable NASA personnel to have direct access to a broad array of researchers and analysts with expertise in the welding of aerospace materials.  This expertise has been a direct benefit in the realm of NASA welding activities including, but not limited to: resolution of weld cracking in the Super Lightweight External Tank Program, development of high powered ultrasonics, the development of the friction stir weld process, and, providing other welding support services to NASA and aerospace contractors.	In order for NASA to have access to this, it must pay EWI a membership fee directly.  Membership is not available from any other source. . 3.  The EWI?s sister organization, The Welding Institute, Cambridge, U.K., holds all intellectual property rights to the friction stir welding process.  No other entity, worldwide, offers a similar welding process.  NASA is developing the FSW process for NASA programs.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the Department of Neurology under Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

The period of performance is approximately 12 months.  This Government anticipates 1,040 hours of a technician and 250 hours of a physician.  The work will be performed at the Massachusetts General Hospitals.  This requirement is the continuation of several NIMH protocols.   Massachusetts General Hospital maintains staff such as child neurologists that are trained to read and interpret sleep data in autistic children.

Therefore based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to select the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered.  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, Office of Administration and Resources Management (OARM), Facilities Management Division (FMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with DCT, Inc. under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for an additional one-month extension period under Contract 68-C-03-017 for on-site operations and maintenance services pending award of a follow-on contract. The current contract is scheduled to expire on 1/31/08.  It is expected that a follow-on contract will be awarded by February 29, 2008 as a result of Solicitation No. PR-CI-07-10484.

During this period, the contractor shall provide services in support of the operations and maintenance of the EPA-Cincinnati Facilities. This includes routine maintenance of all building
and laboratory systems, work orders, service calls, and emergency repairs. Specifically, the contractor shall provide facility support services that include, but are not limited to: The operation and maintenance of buildings and equipment; alterations and repairs to the buildings; computer- assisted drafting (CAD) services; and engineering documentation. Secondary functions include but are not limited to: fire alarm maintenance, snow removal, window washing, pest control, waste removal, and engraving services.

DCT, Inc. is uniquely qualified to meet EPA's requirement during the extension period based on its operational expertise, knowledge of the facility and equipment, familiarity with the on-going projects, and its capability to meet any potential critical deadlines resulting from service calls and/or need of emergency repairs.

A competitive procurement for the proposed extension would entail substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Award to DCT, Inc. will ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of service. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work. Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This action is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 561210. The anticipated award date is 1/25/08.

<DESC>Provide and Install Post Indicator Valves (PIV)
at the DNSC Hammond, IN Depot

The purpose of the contract is to replace eleven (11) existing Post Indicator Valves (PIV) that connect to warehouses 100W, 100E and 200E at the DNSC Hammond, IN Depot with new valves of similar construction and identical function to extend the serviceable operational life of this aspect of the existing fire suppression system for 7 to 10 years.  The  depot is located at 3200 Sheffield Avenue, Hammond, IN and is completely fenced in with a guarded access gate. 

Warehouses 100E, 200E and 100W at the DNSC Hammond, IN Depot each have four (4) underground Post Indicator Valves (PIV?s) located outside each building about five (5) to eight (8) feet below grade.  Eleven of the 12 valves have been in service for over 30 years.  The twelfth PIV, connected to warehouse 200E, riser house #12 was replaced about three years ago.

The grade of most of the Hammond, IN Depot is very close to the water table.  This varies substantially with the seasons.  The ground to be excavated consists of and in some instances is mostly slag.  Excavation on this site can be difficult and generally encounters large volumes of ground water two to three feet below grade. 

REQUIREMENT - CLIN #0001   Replace Post Indicator Valves:

The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, parts, and supplies required to replace eleven existing PIV with new valves of identical functional capabilities.  The contractor shall:

8.	Restore the site to the condition it existed in before work began (note this may include restoration of asphalt paved surfaces).
9.	Gather all debris generated during this project, remove it from the installation and dispose of it in accordance with prevailing federal, state and county regulations and statutes for waste handling and disposal.
10.	Accomplish all work in accordance with related NFPA, electrical and plumbing codes.

The contractor shall protect structures, utilities, sidewalks, pavements, and other facilities from damage caused by settlement, lateral movement, undermining, washout, and other hazards created by excavation operations.  The contractor shall also maintain erosion and sedimentation controls and provide protective insulating materials to protect subgrades and foundation soils against freezing temperatures or frost. 

The Contractor is responsible for the performance of all services to accomplish the intent of the contract and shall propose a firm, fixed price to replace eleven existing PIV with valves of identical or superior capabilities, inspect and test the installed valves and related connection to the fire suppression system and certify full functionality of the completed installation.  This price shall include consideration for all labor, supervision, replacement valves, related parts, materials, and supplies; and shall include all considerations for administration, overhead, and profit. The proposed price shall be itemized to reflect the cost per installed valve and separately identify overhead and profit.  The following submittals are required with the Contractor?s offer:  

1.	The contractor shall develop and submit a comprehensive work plan to identify all tasks required to replace the valves, test and certify the operation of the new valves, restore the site and remove all generated debris.   The work plan shall identify all applicable standards such as NFPA 25, NFPA 70, NFPA 101, and NFPA 110 and NEC codes and explain how those requirements will be met. Conflicts in regulatory and/or codified requirements shall be reconciled in favor of the more stringent guidance.

2.	Copies of all related licenses for employees that will perform repairs, if required by Federal, State or Local regulations.

3.	Copies of certifications in the related trades for employees that will perform these repairs.

Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill AFB, UT
last updated on:  01/15/2008

	This announcement is provided as part of market research to identify potential contractors who have the particular experience, skills and knowledge to accomplish the effort described.  The KC-135 ATS Acquisition Team is developing a prospective requirement for additional BOWST systems.  
	This will be a follow-on supply (not services) acquisition. Initial development and delivery of the first two BOWST systems is being accomplished by the 12th Trainer Development Engineering team at Randolph AFB, Texas (AETC).  
	The Air Force has identified funding for one additional unit in the Fiscal Year 2008 cycle (BOWST unit #3) to be installed at the McConnell AFB KC-135 ATS site.  Options for up to eight additional units (i.e., BOWST units 4 through 11) may be described in the final prospective RFP, but funding for additional units may or may not materialize by FY2010.  Units 4-11 will be installed at other KC-135 ATS CONUS and OCONUS sites not yet named.  
	The functional/performance requirements of these follow-on units (i.e., 3 through 11) will be the same as described in the BOWST 1 and 2 System Requirements Document (SRD). The operator interface, aero package modeling, control loading and aural implementations must be carried out so as to embody accurate representations of the real world.  The BOWST 1 and 2 design criteria packages (data) will be made available during the RFP process, including all aero and control loading, and aural models and software.   The Air Force cannot guarantee that the data can be relied upon as to accuracy, completeness or suitability as the sole standard for satisfying the functional and performance requirements of this prospective acquisition.
	The following additional functionality will also be required for these follow-on units: 
		1.	Connectivity to existing Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs) at each site to ensure that Crew Resource Management (CRM) type training can be performed.  This OFT/BOWST connectivity requirement is a local site connectivity requirement only.  For example, for BOWST unit 3, this is defined as connectivity to all three (3) OFTs at the McConnell AFB site.  For units 4-11, BOWST/OFT connectivity shall be specific to each site (i.e., one to 2 OFTs) to be named at a later date.  
		2.	Night Vision Goggle (NVG) stimulated capability.  NVG capability is only applicable to the BOWST device; no changes will be required to the actual OFTs in the training system.  NVG capability must include consideration of appropriate boom compartment lighting design as well as visual system capabilities.  
		3.	It is the intent of the AF to connect, in the future, to existing Distributed Mission Operation (DMO) networks.  The BOWST units 3-11 must be DMO-capable only.  There is no requirement to actually connect to these networks at this time.

	Options may also be described for upgrades or retrofits to the BOWST units 1 and 2 for BOWST/OFT connectivity to the four (4) OFTs at Altus AFB.  

	Any sources interested in and responding to this synopsis shall describe their qualifications in the following areas:
        1.	Current and past experience on training devices addressed above and its relevance to the subject acquisition.
	2.	Current experience in designing, building, networking and integrating devices of similar complexity and its relevance to the subject acquisition with particular emphasis on experience in designing and integrating training systems in a networked environment.
	3.	Personnel experience/qualifications in the areas of Training Systems Device Engineering, modification management, and integration.
	4.	Corporate experience managing complex systems similar to those described above.

	Depending on responses received from potential sources, the Air Force will make decisions on how to proceed.  This synopsis shall not be construed to commit the Air Force to any particular course of action.  Only those with a Bona Fide interest in this requirement who can clearly demonstrate qualifications and are capable of supporting the requirements as described above should respond no later than 1600 hours, Mountain Time, 28 Jan 2008. 
	The point of contact for this requirement is the Contracting Officer, Lance S Hardman.  Responses should be directed the following E-mail address:  lance.hardman@hill.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VISN 3) Healthcare Network intends to negotiate a multi-award agreement with the following Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved General Services Administration (GSA) companies to provide control and preventative measures for the active surveillance of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): Cepheid, 904 Caribbean Drive Sunnyvale, California 94089 for its GeneXpert System.  The GeneXpert System combines sample preparation with real-time PCR amplification and detection for fully integrated and automated nucleic acid analysis.  The systemýýýs capability enables users to perform up to 16 different molecular tests concurrently.  Specimens can be processed as they come in, 24/7, 365 days a year. BD Diagnostics GeneOhm, 6146 Nancy Ridge Drive San Diego, California 92121 for its Smart Cycler Desktop System.  The Smart Cycler Desktop System provides the government with a cost-effective, accurate and rapid means to detect MRSA colonization.  When dealing with large numbers of specimens, the achromopeptidase lysis method offers easier processing than the kit recommended method without negatively affecting PCR sensitivity or specificity. Clinical research indicates that the implementation of universal surveillance, which introduces the testing of all admitted patients, is far more effective than just passive or targeted active surveillance when monitoring for Methicillin-Resistant Staphyloccus aureus (MRSA).  The purpose of this acquisition is to reduce and or mitigate the spread of Methicillin-Resistant Staphyloccus aureus (MRSA) throughout VISN 3ýýýs Healthcare Network through active surveillance of cultures.  The procurement of the outlined product offerings will add the required value in the management of multi-drug resistant organisms within VISN 3.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>013108
<ARCHDATE>03312008
<CONTACT>Brian Knutson, (309) 782-1994
<DESC>The BC/MU was first conceived as a way to support US Army Combat Engineers in their need to use battery powered hand tools while deployed to locations that do not have an existing electrical infrastructure, or has only foreign infrastructures availab le.  The objective is to make a combat engineer team effective as quickly as possible.  Therefore, the ability to charge batteries while the engineer team is moving to its next job site became a desirable goal.  To this end a number of electrical adaptors and a power inverter were added to the kit so that the inverter could be powered by a 24 volt truck electrical system, or a 12 volt electrical system, or any AC electrical service that may be encountered in any country.  The batteries to be charged are 18 volt rechargeable nickel-cadmium dry cell batteries found in standard power tool kits such as DeWalt, Ryobi, Craftsman, etc.  However, since the batteries are actually part of the Armys Carpenters Supplemental Tool Kit (CSTK), the charging interface beco mes dependent upon the exact brand of tool that is in the CSTK (for the CSTK tool list that the BCMU will support, please contact Brian Knutson at brian.knutson1@us.army.mil).  The batteries to be charged are actually held in a set of belt packs that are d esigned to provide 3 times the available power to a power tool user.  This is meant to help overcome the negative environmental effects of working in extreme hot and extreme cold climates.  This BC/MU includes 4 belt packs, each with space for 3 batteries to hook up so that the usable power of the batteries last 3 times longer than a single battery would.  These 18V batteries are charged while they are in the belt packs.  It is important to note that although the belt packs are provided as part of the BC/MU  the batteries are not.  The batteries come directly from the CSTK.  To reiterate, the designer of the belt pack in the BC/MU must know the exact brand of the battery provided in the CSTK.  The BC/MU also has 4 standard 125V electrical outlets fed by the i nverter.  These outlets provide a place to plug in 4 normal battery charger bases so that batteries can be charged outside of those in the belt packs.   This is necessary to support some 6 volt batteries that are also used in the CSTK.<BR>      <BR>Estimat ed quantity requirements are 240 each for a 3-year period.  Estimated issue date is 31-Jan-2008.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.502 and 5.102, therefore, hardcopies will not be provided.  Vendors wishing an electr onic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aais.ria.army.mil/aais/SOLINFO/index.htm<BR><BR>CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.

<DESC>To cover the cost to rebuild one each Government owned 4 Axis Giddings and Lewis ORION 2300 Horizontal Maching Center(WV-12688) in accordance with Watervliet Arsenal Scope of Work # 07-08-3408. Sole Source Procurement with Giddings and Lewis because the ORION 2300 (WV-12688) was manufactured by Giddings and Lewis, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and this company possesses the proprietary software that operates the integrated pallet transfer system.  The WV-12688 is part of a machining cell t hat is comprised of three (3) ORION 2300s manufactured by Giddings and Lewis.  The other 2 machines are WV-12687 and WV-12689.  These 3 machines utilize this integrated pallet transfer system to move parts being machined within the cell without additional  machine setup time.  The parts are initially setup on precision pallets that are manufactured to interface with the machine tables on each of the three machine tools. The pallet transfer system software must be capable of communicating with each individua l machine tool within this cell.  The proprietary software ensures that the pallets are all properly located on the machine tables regardless of which machine is being used within the cell. This means the machine control knows the exact location of the par t in relation to the various cutting tools. Each machine can be programmed to perform similar or sequential operations depending on the production volume. Since only one setup per part is required on the integrated pallets and numerous operations can be pe rformed on the three different machines; significant reductions are achieved in setup and machining time resulting in considerable cost savings. Furthermore, part quality is much more consistent and rework costs/delays are minimized. Without the proprietar y software from the OEM, the benefits of the three machine cell would be significantly reduced. The scope of work for this rebuild requires a control upgrade and Giddings and Lewis is the only known company that can provide the programming necessary for th e new control to communicate with the existing pallet transfer software.  The existing pallet transfer software cannot be changed because the pallet transfer unit must be capable of communicating with the other two machine tool controls not being replaced. <BR>In  addition, although these types of systems are common in the marketplace each company has their own methodology and software logic to handle their brand of control systems and machines.  To open this project up to other than G&L would require a thir d party to replace the existing system software for the entire cell. They would have to start from scratch, replace all the controls on the machines and material handling systems. This is just not realistically feasible or economical.  If Watervliet had th e financial resources and manufacturing back-up systems to do the entire 3-cell system including the material handling system then this would be a possibility.  But funding availability and more importantly the manufacturing demands on these machines makes  this scenario impossible.  We could not afford to shutdown the entire cell for an extended period. The other 2 machines and pallet transfer system must remain operational while the WV-12688 is being rebuilt due maintain production schedules.  Giddings and  Lewis is the owner of the proprietary software residing on the pallet transfer system and therefore is the only source that can provide the required rebuild service. Note 22 applies.<BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Modification to the C-130 AVIONICS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM  (AMP) LOW RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION (LRIP) MARKET RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT.  Contracting Office: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel  Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 866th Aeronautical Systems Group,  Wright Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, anticipates issuing, on or about October  2007, a sole source Request for Proposal to The Boeing Company, 2401 East  Wardlow Road, Long Beach, CA 90807-5309 for the manufacture and  installation of approximately twenty-two (22) C-130 AMP LRIP kits and  approximately 15 Lot 4 Full Rate Production (FRP) kit buys as a transition  from LRIP to FRP.  The scope will include sustaining engineering tasks,  including but not limited to, deficiency reporting, correction of  deficiencies, over and above maintenance actions, and parts obsolescence  management, and an embedded source familiarization phase to enhance  outyear competitive options.  The scope also includes, but is not limited  to, support requirements such as Type 1 aircrew, maintenance, and  installation training; training system modifications, as required, to  support LRIP-equipped aircraft; and Interim Contractor Support.  This LRIP  effort may contain elements of both United States Air Force and Foreign  Military Sales requirements.  The planned period of performance for any  contract action to be issued as a result of this solicitation is FY08  through FY13.  This acquisition is a follow-on to the competitively  awarded C-130 AMP System Development and Design contract currently being  performed by Boeing (F33657-01-C-0047).  A complete reprocurement data  package is not available (See Note 22).  Potential offerors must: (1)  possess or demonstrate the ability to acquire program management, materiel  requisition, manufacturing/fabrication, installation, engineering,  financial, contracting, and quality assurance personnel; (2) possess or  demonstrate the ability to possess adequate facilities and support  infrastructure to complete manufacturing/ fabrication/installation  requirements; (3) demonstrate sufficient detailed understanding of C-130  AMP kit design requirements/training/ancillary requirements sufficient to  successfully complete physical/functional configuration audit (PCA/FCA)  requirements prior to government hardware acceptance; (4) possess or  demonstrate a thorough understanding of C-130 Combat Delivery fleet  configuration status, and associated kit modifications to meet common  configuration installation requirements; and (5) be capable of  incrementally delivering approximately 22 PCA/FCA compliant LRIP kits by  4QFY12 and incremental installation of those kits by 2QFY13.  Any response  to this synopsis must provide evidence of the ability to meet these  requirements and be submitted no later than 30 July 2007.  This notice of  intent is not a request for competitive proposals for this immediate  acquisition.  The Air Force’s intent is to pursue competition for future  AMP requirements.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine if any  competitive sources exist and to notify industry of the impending action  so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Potential  subcontractors should contact Boeing directly. The point of contact at  Boeing is Richard Terada, Director, Supplier Management C-130 Production,  The Boeing Company, 2401 East Wardlow Road, Long Beach, CA 90807-5309;  telephone (562) 384-4457; email: (richard.k.terada@boeing.com).

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>On behalf of the Department of Justice (DOJ), it is the intent of the IRS to issue a national contract for Telecommunications Site Maintenance services and to seek a single contractor to lead the program as a prime.

The following amendment was made to respond to additional questions received by potential sources based on the initial sources sought announcement:

Question 1: Are you able to provide a more detailed break-down of the site locations in addition to the regional map?

Response: At this time, we are not able to provide a detailed break-down of site locations. Please keep in mind that JPO is planning on concentrating on the Western region at the initial stage of the project. The Western area currently has 6 sites in Southern California and 6 Sites in Washington State. As the project moves along, additional sites will be added.
 

Question 2: With respect to the annual site inspections, you note the possible site count is 120 - are we to assume this number would serve as the approximate number of annual inspections required?

Response: At this time, an assumption of 120 sites for annual site inspections seems appropriate. However, keep in mind that at the initial stage, the 12 sites in the Western region is our main concentration at this point. All other site inspection will be added with further notice.
     

Questions regarding the subject amendment shall be submitted, in writing, no later than 10:00 AM, EST, January 16, 2008 to lynette.b.fadiya@irs.gov and be clearly labeled "Questions Regarding Amendment".

"Technical Inquiry and Technical Data Maintenance
for NREL's Alternative Fuels Data Center"
January 11, 2008

INTRODUCTION

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Center for Transportation Technologies and Systems (CTTS) is responsible for providing technical integration and technical data and research in support of several activities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) related to accelerating the displacement of petroleum-based fuels through the use of alternative fuels and other advanced vehicle and fuel technologies.   Providing unbiased technical information, tools, and resources is a requirement of several pieces of federal legislation, including the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 and 1995. NREL has the lead responsibility for providing this technical resource, which has taken the form of vehicle and fleet evaluations, data collection and research, development of on-line tools and resources, and overall integration and management of this base of knowledge in the Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicle Data Center (AFDC).  Access to the resources of the AFDC is provided via the Internet and through a technical inquiry function linked to DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Information Center.

NREL is seeking organizations to assist with technical inquiries and database content development related to the field of alternative and advanced fuels and vehicles, fuel production and feedstock, and fuel and vehicle related DOE programs.  The major tasks associated with this effort include:

  --	Assisting NREL in the development and maintenance of database content related to alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies.  Key areas of focus include relevant federal, state and local legislation and incentives, fueling stations, available vehicle and fuel technologies, fuel production and biomass as well as other related data.

  --	Researching and responding to complex and specialized technical queries NREL, DOE, industry and the public related to production, distribution and use of alternative and advanced fuels and vehicles.

Tasks will require gathering information about, and maintaining knowledge of, alternative fuels and advanced fuel and vehicle technologies, the related industries, and applications through reading and researching, Web searches, electronic newsletters, industry contacts, etc.  For the purposes of this activity, alternative fuels include those established by EPAct, including ethanol, natural gas, propane, electricity, biodiesel, and hydrogen.  Examples of advanced fuel and vehicle technologies to be covered include other fuel blends such as E10 (10% ethanol/90% gasoline) and B2 (2% biodiesel/98% diesel), other biodiesel blends, ultra low sulfur diesel, light- and heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles, light- and medium-duty passenger diesel vehicles, idle reduction technologies, fuel efficient vehicles, and other fuel economy measures.

SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL INQUIRY RESPONSE
To support NREL in this effort, an organization must demonstrate the capability to provide quick-response resources and knowledgeable, experienced technical staff to field inquiries. The organization being sought shall have the capability to answer questions on all aspects of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles where the representation of fuel neutrality is absolute. The response team members must be capable of answering questions via:
 
1.	Technical knowledge and expertise gained by having worked in the alternative fuel and advanced transportation field; 
2.	Monitoring of industry information, development, and technical contacts; 
3.	Searching for and interpreting alternative fuels and related information found on the web;

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500.

This acquisition provides for the continuation of the Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers program. The current contracts (N01-AI-30071 with the J. Craig Venter Institute and HHSN266200400001C with Massachusetts Institute of Technology) are due to expire on October 30, 2008. Through this acquisition, up to two large-scale Genomic Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (hereinafter also referred to as "Centers") will be established that support a diverse set of genome sequencing activities.  For purposes of this acquisition, genomic sequencing activities include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping.  High throughput sequencing capacity is defined as the capability to produce high quality sequencing data in a highly efficient manner with continuous increase in efficiency and decrease in costs; generate a diverse variety of genome sequence products; develop and implement new technologies; and maintain an automated production pipeline with a throughput of 20 million successful sequence reads per year. Comparative genomics and genotyping are defined as using high throughput platforms to examine the whole genome for genetic variation. 

Genomes that will be sequenced through these Centers include microorganisms considered agents of bioterrorism (NIAID Category A-C priority pathogens http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/default.htm), clinical isolates, closely related species and strains, invertebrate vectors of diseases, and microorganisms responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm).  Emphasis will be placed on sequencing multiple strains and isolates of specific microbial species and communities than on sequencing individual microorganisms.

Centers will provide rapid and cost-efficient sequencing of microbial and invertebrate vector genomic DNA in an industrial production sequencing environment. Genome sequences will be generated from well characterized microbial strains and clinical isolates.  Centers will examine genetic variation and perform genotyping in populations and communities of human pathogens and also across the human genome with the goal of identifying genetic associations with observable phenotypes in the pathogen and in the human host.  These include, for example, microbial genetic correlates of disease emergence, virulence, and transmissibility, and host genetic variation that are associated with susceptibility to infection, disease severity, progression and outcome, responses to vaccination, and therapeutics.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice, Classification Code R - The Department of Justice, United States Marshals Service, Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) requires maintenance and logistics support for one, Beech 99, twin turbo prop aircraft, owned and operated by the JPATS, serial number U-134, registration number N80275.  This aircraft is thirty-six years old (circa 1970) and is currently operated and maintained at the JPATS main operational site, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico transporting illegal aliens and prisoners throughout the Caribbean basin.  This notice is an information request only for vendors, who are qualified to perform the following maintenance requirements:  The maintenance and logistics services support required include the replacement of the main wing spar, all three segments; left, right, and center.  The main wing spar is a flight critical component; the failure of which could have catastrophic consequences, so it is absolutely imperative that this complex replacement, inspection, and subsequent repairs, are performed by experts thoroughly familiar with the inspection requirements who are in possession of, or have the rights too, OEM data and engineering support.  This requirement will cause extensive disassembly of the aircraft wing structural components, and subcomponents, resulting in substantial out-of-commission times for the aircraft thus mandating that this requirement be bundled with the accomplishment of the aircraft?s normally scheduled annual inspection; to include the accomplishment of non-routine maintenance items identified by the maintenance entity during the accomplishment of the inspection.  Qualified vendors must be an approved vendor for the Beech (Raytheon) Aircraft Company.  Furthermore, vendors must be approved by the aircrafts original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to perform this main wing spar replacement on aircraft in this age category, and must have possession of the required OEM engineer drawings showing allowable dimensions, clearances and tolerances of flight critical wing spar components, and must  possess the unique, tools, test sets, facilities, equipment, and jigs required for inspection accomplishment.  Qualified respondents to this announcement must provide detailed and concise information in their own format and in sufficient detail for the Government to make a determination if they can be considered as a qualified source from which to place on an approved vendor list to request a quote from.  The Government has the sole discretion as whether or not a potential vendor may be added to the approved vendor list.  This Notice is being conducted for informational purposes only; it is not a request for proposals.  No associated reimbursement of costs will be made for responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted by facsimile; 405-231-4531 or by email to the point of contact mark.melendez@usdoj.gov.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811310, with a size standard $6.5 million dollars.  If a sufficient number of determined qualified small business respondents are received, the requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns only.  All interested sources must submit their responses electronically to the point of contact; Mark Melendez by the close of business, 3:00 CT, January 17, 2008.

<DESC>ADVERTISEMENT FOR PREQUALIFICATION
Subject to conditions prescribed by the University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, responses to the University's prequalification documents for a Lump Sum construction Subcontract are sought for the following project:
DEMOLITION OF BUILDING 51 AND BEVATRON
PREQUALIFICATION CRITERIA
SOLICITATION NUMBER 932

To be performed at 
Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 
One Cyclotron Road
Berkeley, CA 94720
Prequalification of Prospective Bidders:	The University has determined that bidders who submit bids on this project must be prequalified. 
Prequalified bidders will be required to have a valid California contractor's licenses appropriate for the type of work involved.
General Description of Work:  Provide all labor, material, tools and equipment to complete all work as described in the plans and specifications.  The scope of work includes:
	
Base Work 
This project includes the demolition, deactivation and disposal of Building 51 and Building 51A including all tunnels, shallow foundations including shield blocks and the Bevatron accelerator housed within the building. The spatial extent of the project covers surface and subsurface materials out to the building footprint.

Building 51 is a 126,527 GSF steel-frame structure, built in the early 1950s, with a wood roof and Transite (an asbestos-containing material) exterior siding. All occupants will be vacated from this building prior to a notice to proceed for this work. Building 51 houses the Bevatron accelerator that is approximately 180 feet in diameter and consists of approximately 12,000 tons of steel and other metals. Approximately 13,500 tons of concrete shielding blocks currently encircle the accelerator. The Bevatron, a large weak-focusing synchrotron accelerator, began operation in 1954, and was last operated in 1993. 
Residual induced radioactivity is present from activation products in materials exposed to subatomic particle beams and radiation scatter. As a result of this activation, the Bevatron and surrounding structural materials contain low levels of radioactive materials. Other known hazardous materials include lead (e.g., paint, dust, brick, caulk), asbestos, silica, beryllium, PCB, volative organic compounds, and mercury.
The physical scope of the project would include: removal of the Bevatron; demolition of Buildings 51 and 51A, including their foundations; removal and disposition, including transportation of shield blocks, equipment, demolition debris, etc.; relocation of existing utilities; and site stabilization. It is envisioned that the final state of the site would be cleared and made land suitable for new construction.

Estimated Price Range and Construction Period:  The estimated value of the project is between $28M and $35M.  The project will be incrementally funded and require the selected subcontractor to manage budgets within the funded amount. The planned project completion time is approximately 42 months.

<DESC>The Bureau is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating any technologies or materials with potential application in overt, visual authentication features in U.S. currency.  Technologies offered should provide effective counterfeit deterrence against all types of threats, including both traditional printing and digital reproduction.  Proposed features may be incorporated into the note (inks, substrate), or applied to the note, and should not require the use of any device for verification.

Any technologies or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other production/processing requirements.  An effective feature is defined as a feature that cannot be easily simulated or duplicated; for example, a feature that can be simulated to approximate a passable outward appearance or response of a genuine feature is not effective or acceptable.

Additionally, the Bureau is interested in reviewing products, materials, and technologies that will enhance the usefulness of currency notes; for example, authentication/denomination features for the visually impaired and enhancement of circulation life.

Current versions of currency paper and ink specifications, as well as durability testing procedures, are available upon written request.

The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials, for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e., means a proven concept, can provide a sample).  For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and/or brief technical descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) plus price information for the purchase of larger test quantities to the BEP, Office of Acquisition, Attn: Larry McCain, 14th and C Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20228-0001.  Larger quantities of samples may be procured through simplified acquisition (small purchase) for further assessment.  The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party.  Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted.  If you have any questions please contact Larry McCain on (202) 874-0133 or via e-mail at larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov

<SUBJECT>A -- Institutional Review Board Services - Increase Scope of Work
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of North Carolina ? Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), Office of Human Research Ethics, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, to expand the scope of contract EP-D-06-101 to provide Institutional Review Board (IRB) services for Human Research for the entire agency.  The services required are essential for research experiments involving human subjects.  The contractor shall serve as the designated IRB of record; provide review and oversight of EPA's human subject research; coordinate with and establish IRB authorization agreements; provide consultation to EPA staff; and provide training for EPA staff related to ethics and other topics relevant to conducting human research.  The remaining period of performance is potentially 3 ? years including  optional periods.  

The vast majority of the Agency's human studies are conducted on the UNC campus, and research protocols for those studies must be reviewed and monitored by a UNC IRB to ensure compliance with UNC policy of on-campus research involving UNC staff.  The expansion in scope of contract EPD06101, to include all of EPA's IRB requirements, will not significantly increase the total number of new IRBs required under the existing contract.  Unrelated to the expansion issue, there is also a proposed increase in historical volume in the area of IRB modifications, from 30 to 50 annually, to more correctly align the statement of work with more recent actuals encountered during the first 18 months of the existing contract.  EPA believes that expanding the existing contract to include all its IRB requirements is in the best interest of the Agency because this action will make the process consistent and cost effective.

All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services shall fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541690, which has a small business size standard of $6.5 million, is applicable.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.

SCOPE OF WORK

Education/Investing in People Program Leader
  
I.  Background

USAID/Morocco??s Education Office (ED) provides technical leadership for the design, management and monitoring of USAID/Morocco??s strategic objective, ??Improved Education and Training for Employment??, or Investing in People area under the new Foreign Assistance framework.   This Office provides oversight to institutional contractors, grantees and short-term consultants charged with the implementation and monitoring of education, technical training, youth development, and general human development program areas.  It is USAID/Morocco's primary point of contact for education and training related matters with the Government of Morocco (GOM), NGOs, foundations, private sector training providers, other donors, international organizations, and USG offices concerned with education and training in Morocco. 

The education strategic objective aims to improve the quality and relevance of basic education and of lower level vocational training to enhance job placement opportunities or subsequent level education.  This is achieved through a wide range of interventions involving a variety of partners.  A new strategy, now being developed as part of USAID??s new five-year strategy for 2009-2013, will focus on life skills and primary education.  It aims at increasing the engagement of Moroccan youth in social, economic, and political life through the acquisition of life skills gained by both in-school and out-of-school youth.  

The ED Program Leader will serve in the ED Office, USAID/Morocco.  The incumbent will be expected to work independently, with minimal oversight from the Mission Director, based on a general assignment of responsibilities.  The incumbent is considered the Mission??s lead expert in investing in people, education, and youth with all duties and responsibilities of a senior USAID officer.  The incumbent will be responsible for activities to be developed under the new strategic plan for 2009-2013.  Due to the high level of responsibility in this position, the ED Program Leader will have wide latitude in the exercise of her/his duties for program design, management, and evaluation, and for the identification and resolution of issues affecting program performance both within and outside of the Mission.  S/he serves as the USAID liaison for the sector with USAID/Washington, the GOM, the donor community (World Bank, UN Agencies and bi-lateral donors), associations, foundations, private sector entities and other parties involved in developing and supporting education initiatives and policy dialogue in Morocco.

II. Duties and Responsibilities

The ED Program Leader will provide leadership, guidance, and overall direction on the development and execution of USAID/Morocco??s activities under the ED Strategic Objective, both as currently conceived under the Mission??s 2004-2008 Strategic Plan and as finally agreed-upon for the new 2009-2013 strategy.

Specific duties and responsibilities shall include, but are not limited to:

1.	Serve as the senior advisor to the Mission Director and senior GOM officials on policy and programs related to education.

2.	Coach and direct the team to achieve successful implementation of work plans and provide technical oversight to ensure sustainability of USAID accomplishments.  Apply qualitative and quantitative methods to assess and improve the effectiveness of the program and the management processes.  Take initiative for development of new program ideas and defend them for inclusion in the Country Assistance Strategy and to obtain funding.  Ensure liaison with other USAID/Morocco Team Leaders for program synergies and broader understanding of mutual opportunities.  Work with USAID/Washington backstops to keep them abreast of progress of the Morocco program.

3.	Maintain regular contacts with key GOM counterparts regarding USAID role and partnership in support of education/training reform in Morocco.  Seek active GOM participation in the validation process of USAID-developed education/training products and processes for use of materials at a wider scale.  Negotiate new program ideas; report on implementation progress and brief appropriate and relevant GOM counterparts on the USAID education/Investing in People strategy, implementation progress, issues, or special events.  Negotiate program strategy adjustments and draft SOAG Amendments, Implementation letters and other relevant documents for mutual approval.

4.	Provide technical guidance and management oversight to institutional contractors/grantees implementing education strategic objective activities.  Manage the review and approval process of the contractor/grantee??s work plans within USAID and negotiate changes with Chiefs-of-Party.  Ensure that monitoring systems accurately measure progress towards achievement of results.  Make site visits to activity sites, for progress monitoring and partner/beneficiary feedback.  Represent USAID at contractor-organized events to raise visibility of USAID-funded initiatives and to ensure that the audience understands the overall context of the USAID education program and how it assists the GOM in carrying out its reform agenda.

5.	Chair SO meetings to ensure adequate and timely communication flow between contractor/grantee teams and the USAID education SO core team and to convey any USAID general mandates, issues, or concerns.  Ensure that contractors adhere to the general SO policy for communication with the GOM.

6.	Prepare education SO sections of required USAID internal reports (e.g. resource requests, mid-term reviews) and SO-specific reports.  Provide technical response to inquiries from Washington, the Embassy, U.S. education representatives and other individuals desiring information on the USAID education program.  Represent USAID at national, regional or international education conferences or events.

7.	Serve on teams other than the education team, for program synergy and to provide input as relevant to the education sector and other areas that cut across the USAID portfolio.

8.	Provide expert advice, mentoring and oversight to ED staff members (one resident-hire USPSC and two Foreign Service Nationals) whose responsibilities include coordination of the reporting on in-country and other participant training funded under the various USAID SOs using TraiNet, to ensure uniformity in reporting and to capture the human capacity development magnitude and value across the Mission??s overall program.

III. Supervision and Relationships

The ED Program Leader will serve as the key manager for ensuring the smooth implementation of a complex investing in people, youth development, and education program.  S/he will work under the direction of the USAID/Morocco Mission Director, or her designee.  Performance of the incumbent shall be in relation to the above statement of work and the general technical and administrative objectives of USAID/Morocco??s Education Program.

These shall be manifested in the preparation of annual work objectives and requirements.  A review/update of these objectives will be carried out at least annually.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:
__ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

1.0	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from those in general aviation; Coast Guard missions require frequent operation within salt-laden environments, and conditions, which accelerate the corrosive attack on the airframe structures and components of the HU-25 aircraft.  Inspection of these aircraft in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer??s (OEM) periodic requirements under the U.S. Coast Guard's specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS), historically reveals corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  During these inspections Horizontal Stabilizers S/N 411 and 404 were found unserviceable.  These stabilizers were evaluated and recommended for repair by Dassault Falcon (DFJ) Structural Engineers on 11 April 2007.  
This statement of work describes the inspection, damage evaluation, repair plan proposal and services necessary to return horizontal stabilizers S/Ns 411 & 404, their structures, and components as used on the U.S. Coast Guard HU-25 aircraft in an airworthy condition per DFJ Report Number DFJ-823-6147 and Power Point Inspection of Horizontal Stabilizers.  The horizontal stabilizers shall be painted to match the Coast Guard??s current colors and paint scheme in accordance with (IAW) ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139, and be delivered in a ready for installation condition.  All work shall be performed IAW Dassault Falcon Jet drawings specifications.  
This Statement of Work addresses DFJ??s findings and recommendations for returning each stabilizer to an airworthy condition.  However, it is recognized that during the repair process circumstances outside of the proposed scope of work may arise which could not be anticipated.  For such instances, direct communication with the Coast Guard??s Aircraft Repair and supply Center (ARSC), HU-25 Engineering Cell will be required.  These communications shall be for the purpose of clarification only and shall not be construed by the contractor as authorization for an increase in the scope of work being performed.  In the event the discussions result in need for a change, the contractor shall not perform additional work until so authorized by written modification which has been signed by an authorized Coast Guard contracting officer.  Work performed without written modification may result in unpaid performance on the part of the contractor. The ARSC HU25 Engineering Officer may be reached at (252-335-6887), or you may contact the ARSC HU25 Maintenance Officer at (252-335-6310) for any relevant questions or comments.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
