<DESC>The Joint STARS Program Office of the Electronic Systems Center (751st  Electronic System Group (ELSG) intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal and follow on delivery order for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Joint STARS E-8C Weapon System Trainers/Navigator Training Systems (WSTs/NTSs) to Rockwell Collins via the WR-ALC Rockwell Collins Partnership Corporate Contract.  The statutory authority to do so is 10 U.S.C. 230 (c) (1) which states the following: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one source, or from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." Rockwell Collins is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for these trainers and has maintained, modified, and updated them since 1994.  The anticipated period of performance for the CLS/TSSC will be 1 January 2009 - 31 December ! 2009, with possible options for 4 additional years.  This CLS effort will enable the contractor to operate, maintain and support periodic hardware and software to the WSTs/NTSs and will also accomplish software modifications through the Training System Support Center (TSSC) located at Robins, AFB and provide a minimum, periodic surge capability, and logistics needed to keep all systems available for training.  The training site currently consists of 2 WSTs and 2 NTSs, the TSSC and spares and support equipment.  The Contractor shall work with the engineering teams that are accomplishing the on-going modifications to the WSTs/NTSs to ensure the smooth integration of the periodic aircraft modifications that affect these trainers.  These efforts include, but are not limited to the installation of new engines, the implementation of test data to upgrade the aircraft's aero data package, and software improvements that are initiated by the Simulator Configuration Working Group (SCW! G).  This effort will maintain the trainers and implement concurrency changes to meet the requirements of AFI 36-2248 and 36-2251.  These AFIs outline the requirements for concurrent trainers and supplements the requirements of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular AC-120-40B/C, Airplane Simulator Qualification.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior's Burerau of Land Management intends to make award on a sole source basis to Headaters Economics 810 N. Wallace Avenue, Suite D, Bozeman, MT 59715.  Beginning in 1998, the EPS was developed through a collaboration between BLM and the Sonoran Institute to provide a better basis for public involvement in the socio-economic aspects of BLM's plans and projects, as well as to meet data needs of the agency.  EPS are in the public domain, contain no BLM data or data governed by the Privacy Act, and are freely available for download.  The development of EPS has been reviewed by BLM's Information Technology Investment Board, and has been approved for use on all BLM desktops.  See BLM IB 2006-124 for additional information.  EPS is also used by local governments, non-profit organizations, universities, and other federal agencies.  In 2006 the key personnel involved in developing EPS-Ray Rasker and Jeff van den Noort-left the Sonoran Institute and with other partners established a new non-profit organization, Headwaters Economics.  As a result, the Sonoran Institute no longer supports EPS.  The Sonoran Institute has endorsed Headwaters Economics as the appropriate entity to continue support of these systems.  EPS is available for free download from the Headwaters Economics web site.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation for Contractor to Administer the 2009 Point-of-Sale Facilitated Enrollment (POS FE) Process for the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to award a contract, after full and open competition, to a national Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) Sponsor to administer the Point-of-Sale Facilitated Enrollment (POS FE) process.  The POS FE process provides immediate Part D prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries who are also Medicaid eligible or LIS eligible, but not yet enrolled in a Part D plan.

The Contractor must:
1.	Be a PDP Sponsor under contract with CMS in both 2008 and 2009;
2.	Have in each PDP region (excluding U.S. Territories) a plan benefit package (PBP) with a basic benefit and a premium at or below the 2009 LIS benchmark; 
3.	Have the capacity to adjudicate claims at the point-of-sale;
4.	Have the capacity to contract with the CMS TrOOP Facilitator contractor to perform front-end edits on claims submitted by pharmacy providers;
5.	Have the capacity to partner with a CMS Eligibility Verification contractor who will query State Medicaid eligibility verification systems on those beneficiaries whose dual or LIS eligible status is unknown; 
6.	Have the ability to rapidly establish connectivity with CMS and its designated contractors;
7.	Have the ability to rapidly enroll eligible beneficiaries into its Part D plan; and
8.	Have the ability to notify beneficiaries whose eligibility for POS FE cannot be confirmed and collect claims costs from them if they cannot show proof of dual or LIS eligibility.

Period of performance will be one eighteen-month base period (three months for systems’ building and fifteen months of performance) beginning September 30, 2008 through March 31, 2010.  

CMS intends to issue the RFP in early August, 2008, with award anticipated by September 28, 2008.  All responsible sources who anticipate meeting criterion #2 above and who meet all other listed criteria, may submit a proposal for consideration by the Agency.  (Actual ability to meet criterion #2 will not be known for certain until mid-late August when the low-income premium subsidy amount is announced.)

<SUBJECT>Survey data on Food Safety and Nutrition Concerns
<SOLNBR>FDA1046498
<RESPDATE>080508
<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>FDA1046498<p>

STATEMENT OF WORK<p>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking full and open competition to provide the FDA with historical survey data focusing on food safety and nutrition concerns and consumption intentions among U.S. consumers.<p>

<b>I.  Background</b><p>

The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulates conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.  These products are regularly used by the consumer and have important impacts on their health.  To help consumers make informed consumption choices, CFSAN uses various regulatory and educational approaches to promote the availability and usefulness of consumer information regarding food safety and nutritional characteristics of food products.  <p>

In order for CFSAN to make informed decisions, it is crucial that CFSAN keep abreast of consumer concerns about food safety and nutrition issues related to foods under CFSAN jurisdiction, such as mercury in fish or seafood, foodborne pathogens, acrylamide, and trans fat, and how the concerns may be related to consumption of food products.  In particular, CFSAN is interested in tracking and understanding consumer responses to several recent events.  These events include (1) the announcement, in March, 2004, by FDA and Environmental Protection Agency of a consumer advisory on methylmercury in fish, (2) the announcement, in July, 2003, by FDA of a regulation requiring declaration of trans fat contents on food labels, and (3) the release, in March, 2004, by FDA of test data on the chemical acrylamide in 750 food samples and an action plan.  These events attracted intense media attention and could be reasonably expected to change the levels of consumer concerns over time, which in turn could have led to changes in consumption of certain foods resulting in potential impacts on consumer health.  <p>

<b>II. Scope of work</b><p>

This requisition provides CFSAN with historical survey data of U.S. consumers’ concerns and  consumption intentions that are related to food safety and nutrition issues, including but not limited to (1) mercury in fish or seafood, (2) trans fat, (3) acrylamide, (4) foodborne pathogens, and (5) other food safety related issues.  The data must reflect consumer concerns and intentions before, during, and after certain major events.  The data must also have been collected continuously and with regular and frequent intervals to enable detection of short-term changes and long-term patterns of consumer concerns and consumption intentions.<p>

<b>III. Deliverables</b><p>

Within ten (10) calendar weeks from the award of the requisition, the Contractor shall deliver raw data files and related documentation such as data codes, survey instruments, and description of methodologies survey.  The data period shall cover six (6) years, from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2007.<p>

The raw data files shall be (1) arranged so that each record uniquely identifies and corresponds to one respondent’s data; (2) coded as numeric values rather than character values; and (3) accompanied with documentation showing layout, codes and contents of the files.  The data shall include quantitative measures of consumer concerns and consumption intentions as well as individual background information, including but not limited to, gender, age, education, and race/ethnicity.  All personal identifiers, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, shall be excluded from the raw data files.<p>
      
<b>IV. Period of Performance</b><p>

August 15, 2008 – December 16, 2008.<p>

<SUBJECT>Survey of Cosmetic Products for Phthalate Esters
<SOLNBR>FDA1045448
<RESPDATE>080508
<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>FDA1045448<p>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking small business competition for vendors to conduct a survey of cosmetic products for phthalate esters. <p>

<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>

Phthalate esters are present in many consumer products, including food wrappings, medical devices (e.g., blood bags), children's toys, wood finishes, paints, upholstery, plastic products and cosmetics.  In cosmetic products, phthalate esters are used as solvents for fragrances, suspension agents for solids in aerosols, lubricants for aerosol valves, antifoaming agents, skin emollients, and plasticizers in nail care products.  As a result of their extensive use in this wide variety of applications, phthalate esters are almost ubiquitous in the human environment and have been found in food, water, and other sources.<p>

Phthalate esters are of potential concern because of reproductive and other toxic effects reported for phthalate esters in animal models.  Tests with rats have shown that some phthalate esters can damage the male reproductive system of offspring and cause other developmental abnormalities. The relevance of human exposure to phthalate esters is difficult to assess because the effects observed in animals resulted from exposure to relatively high doses, and more importantly, rats may metabolize phthalate esters differently than humans. <p>

Metabolites of phthalate esters have been found in human urine, but the levels are highly variable from person to person and between different demographic groups.  Because of the common use of phthalates in consumer products it is difficult to pin point any specific product as the source of phthalate esters in human urine. <p>

FDA initiated limited surveys of cosmetic products for phthalate esters in 2002. A more extensive survey of cosmetic products will help FDA determine to what extent cosmetic products contribute to the total human exposure to phthalates.<p>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF WORK</b><p>

The Contractor shall work closely with the FDA Project Officer throughout this project.<p>

The Contractor shall conduct a laboratory survey of cosmetic products for the phthalate esters that have been most typically found in cosmetics:  dimethylphthalate (DMP), diethylphthalate (DE), dibutylphthalate (DBP) and, for certain product types, butylbenzylphthalate (BBP).    General product categories to be analyzed include: body lotion, face lotion, hairspray, deodorant, fragrance, hair gel, hair mousse, body wash, shampoo, hand cream, and nail enamel.   Between 5 and 35 specific products per product category (depending on the category) shall be analyzed.  A total of 200 cosmetic products shall be analyzed and the levels of phthalate esters found reported.  <p>

Specifically,<p>

<li>1. The Contractor shall identify appropriate laboratory analytical methods and consult with the project officer in making the final selection of method(s) to be used in the survey.  

<li>2. The Contractor shall demonstrate the ability to perform the necessary analyses by performing recovery studies on a variety of cosmetic matrices identified by the Project Officer.  Results of the recovery studies must be reviewed and approved by the Project Officer before the rest of the work may proceed.

<li>3. The Contractor shall consult with the Project Officer to refine the list of product categories and the specific products to include in the survey.  The Project Officer must approve the final list.

<li>4. The Contractor shall purchase the specific cosmetic products on the final list described above.

<li>5. The Contractor shall analyze the specific cosmetic products on the final list for the phthalate esters identified above.

<li>6. The Contractor shall provide reports as described under “Deliverables,” below.</li><p>


<p><b>DELIVERABLES</b><p>

<li>The Contractor shall provide a report of recovery studies described under #2, above.  (One electronic copy and one paper copy, in a format specified by the Project Officer.) 
<li>The Contractor shall provide interim reports, at 3 month intervals, on the results of the analysis of cosmetic products for phthalate esters.  
<li>The Contractor shall provide a final report that includes the results of all analyses of cosmetic product for phthalate esters, a full description of the methods used, the results of the initial recovery studies, a description of problems encountered (if any) and their solution, and other issues relevant to the study.
<li>The Contractor shall ship all unused product to the FDA project team at the end of the study using an FDA FedEx or UPS account, which would involve no additional cost to the Contractor.</li><p>


<p><b>EVALUATION OF VENDORS</b><p>

<b>Personnel (40 points)</B><p>

Offeror shall demonstrate that it employs the personnel required to perform high quality quantitative analysis of cosmetics for phthalate esters.  The offeror shall name the participating personnel, identify their qualifications and experience, and for each person, indicate the percentage of time that would be devoted to this contract.<p>

<b>Overall Price (30 points)</b><p>

The offeror shall provide the best overall value for the FDA in terms of cost, relevant experience and approach.<p>

<b>Organizational Experience (25 points)</B><p>

Offeror shall demonstrate experience in analytical chemical analysis.<p>

<B>Project Management (5 points)</B><p>

Offer shall provide information on the administration of the project.  This should include management plans, methods for implementing, and quality control and cost control procedures.<p>

<b>Period of Performance</B><p>

The performance period will be one year from the time of award.  <p>

The Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 3), must be completed by the past performance references identified in Attachment 2 and submitted to the identified Contracting Officer by the closing date and time of this synopsis/solicitation.  If the questionnaires received by the date and time indicated are incomplete, they shall not be considered a material flaw in the proposal; however, such non-receipt of completed questionnaire may adversely affect the rating of this factor.

Electronic submission is acceptable.   
EVALUATIONS
In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whos offer conforming to the synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:    
Factor #1 Corporate Experience
The evaluation of corporate experience examines the relationship of your company, personnel, and proposed subcontractors, in working with each other as a team on recent or relevant past project(s) of similar scope and magnitude to this project.

Factor #2 Past Performance
Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective.  The evaluation of past performance will include the contractors history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, record of conforming to applicable law and industry standards, quality of workmanship, record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies, record of controlling costs, safety performance record, and adherence to schedules.  If the offeror is relying upon subcontractors or consultants to meet the requirement of contract, past performance for those contractors will also be evaluated.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most beneficial proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to proposals of other offerors. In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via offeror supplied reference commercial sources, and federal sources including the Past Performance Information Retrieval System and Excluded Parties List System.  Past performance information shall pertain to work performed that is similar to work outlined in the Statement Of Work.  In determining relevance, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule.
Factor #3 Subcontracting Plan
Evaluation will be based on how well percentages, as identified by the Small Business specialist from SBA for NAVFAC targets, are met.
Factor #4 Price
The price proposal will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the offerors proposal.  One or more of the following techniques will be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price:
1.	Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.2.	Comparison of proposed prices with the independent Government estimate.3.	Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.4.	Comparison of proposed prices with resources proposed.
A price that is found to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable.
Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: Corporate Experience and Past Performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.
Alignment with training and Parts Infrastructure:  Due to Government investment in technical training and spare parts, it is in the Governments best interest to select equipment similar to the current inventory.  In evaluating two similar proposals, the system aligning with current Government training and repair parts inventory will be graded more favorably than a proposal not in alignment with current Government training and repair parts inventory.
No contract award will be made to any contractor that is not already registered or is in process of registering on the CCR and ORCA.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to TSE International for the acquisition of one (1) power reel stand (model PRS 18 132 x 115) to support the handling of minesweeping cables during field repairs.  The reel stand must deliver 90,000 In-Lbs of torque while handling an 18,000-pound reel measuring 132 inches in diameter and 115 inches in width.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons: TSE International Incs Powered Reel Stand is the only system qualified to meet the Navys requirement to handle minesweeping cables during field repairs.  The TSE Powered Reel Stand is the result of several difficult redesigns of previous models to support the handling of minesweeping cables.  The reel stand is designed for quick change of the reel without tools.   The reel stand is the only stand that employs a post-type level-wind, caliper brake, and can pay out or pay in the cable.  The reel stand operates on diesel fuel and is designed to withstand the weather of the Texas coastline.  The current reel stand, in use by the Navy, required extensive testing, redesign, and modifications to meet the navys unique field repair requirement.  An alternate manufacturer will have to duplicate TSEs design and development effort, which would make the alternative reel stand cost prohibitive in the quantities the Navy, requires. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency; contact Andrew Tatem 850-234-4001.  NAICS code: 333120 FSC: 3950 Size Std: 750 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation. Mail, facsimile, telephonic or electronic mail requests will not be honored.

In particular, for Phase 1, ARL is seeking prototype, technically mature, RF technology to participate in an experiment in a relevant environment.  The RF sensor system that will be considered acceptable for the purposes of this solicitation shall be technically mature such that:<BR><BR>"The RF technology must be either capable of performing on the move (at least 8mph) or have SWAP (Size Weight and Power) characteristics that would allow it to operate as a hand held unit.<BR><BR>"The technology shall be capable of detecting and geo-spatially locating IEDs at 10m range for moving systems and 1m range for hand-held units (thresholds for the purposes of this solicitation).<BR><BR>"The operator should only need a cursory level of interaction with the sensor system during normal operations.<BR><BR>The Army Research Laboratory plans to set up a temporary facility to conduct the RF technology experiments. ARL is requesting proposals from organizations that currently have a prototype that is capable of gathering data at this facility.  Proposals selected for funding for Phase I will be awarded a cooperative agreement with only the following activities to be funded:  (NOTE:  Fee or Profit is not permitted under a cooperative agreement.)<BR><BR>"	Preparation of system for field experiment<BR>"	1 week of experiments at the Army facility <BR>"	Data analysis<BR>"	Written final report (one month after the experiment)<BR>o	Report must include a description of the RF technology set up during the experiment. The results of the experiment. A technology maturation plan that could be implemented if the government selects the system for a phase 2 effort.  <BR>"	Funding not to exceed 6 man-months<BR><BR>Recipients of the cooperative agreements will have access to the prepared test site for up to one week (on a non-interference basis with other systems).  Based on the Governments assessment of the analysis of the results from these experiments, ARL may invite successful performers to submit proposals for further development and technology maturation, which is Phase 2. Such technology development efforts are expected to be performed under a procurement contract.  The objective system which may be developed under this further effort will require additional features, such as:<BR><BR>"The human interface must simplify the operation and allow someone with limited technical knowledge to operate the sensor system. <BR><BR>"Analysis of collected data must be automated so that a human operator would not be considered part of the processing loop<BR><BR>"The overall solution must function in a heavy electromagnetic environment (EME) and be interoperable with all robots, communication, navigation, and Counter Radio Controlled IED Electronic Warfare (CREW) equipment. <BR><BR>There is a classified (Secret) addendum that more accurately describes the expected RF technology systems capabilities that all offerors MUST review before submission of a proposal to participate in the RF experiment.  Offerors must determine the classification of proposals and the report of the results of the experiments based on the Security Classification Guide provided along with the addendum. Offerors MUST possess a security clearance to be able to review the classified information.   Proposals awarded for further technology development will contain security requirements as appropriate for those specific efforts.  Requests for the Secret addendum and any questions concerning security issues may be directed to the Technical Point of Contact. (Please see Full Announcement)<BR>

<DESC>Subject: Special Notice, Citrix Presentation Server licenses  It is the intent of the Government to purchase Citrix Presentation Server licenses or license renewals and support maintenance using the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Solution Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC). The Statement of Work will be provided in the solicitation. The successful offeror shall provide licenses, license renewals and support maintenance for Citrix Presentation Server software which will be described in the subsequent solicitation for the Dept. of Veterans Affairs - Austin IT Acquisition Center located at 1615 Woodward Street, Austin, TX 78772.  The solicitation will only be available to NASA SEWP IV contract holders.  Comments are due on or before August 1, 2008.Sincerely, Mark ShumakeContracting Officer(512) 326-6029Email:  mark.shumake@va.govJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION(FAR 6.302-1(c)) 1.	Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity:Requesting Activity:	USVA OI&T Region 3 OfficePO Box 131250Ann Arbor, MI   48113-1250Attn:  J. VerreauContracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs	IT Acquisition Center (200/00D3)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX  787722.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved: The purpose of this action is to:	Upgrade 1,510 Citrix perpetual Presentation Server licenses from Enterprise to XenApp Plati-num with Subscription Advantage	Upgrade 1,100 Citrix perpetual Presentation Server licenses from Platinum to XenApp Plati-num with Subscription Advantage	Upgrade 250 Citrix perpetual Presentation Server licenses from Platinum with Subscription Advanced to XenApp Platinum with Subscription Advantage	Restore 840 Citrix expired Presentation Server licenses from Enterprise with Expired Subscrip-tion Advantage to XenApp Platinum with Subscription Advantage	Restore 300 Citrix expired Presentation Server licenses from Platinum with Expired Subscrip-tion Advanced to XenApp Platinum with Subscription Advantage	Consolidate Citrix licensing management across the region	Provide Citrix technical support service bundle of 25 calls	Provide three option years of 4,000 Citrix perpetual XenApp licenses Platinum Edition with Subscription Advantage RenewalThis purchase will protect VAs invested base by:	Leveraging current investment of dollars  Over the 41 sites in Region 3 there are currently some 3,400 licenses already owned by VA.  However, of these about 2,000 are current.  An ad-ditional 1,400 have lapsed which have varying expirations at the Region 3 facilities.  So on completion of this procurement, Region 3 will have in place the upgraded perpetual licenses to the Platinum level which provides newer technology and features for thin client technology, and will have an overall subscription plan for all active licenses.	Leverage current investment of staff training and operational familiarity  Over a number of years various facilities throughout what is now region 3 have accumulated the existing substan-tial pool of Citrix licenses.  In that time technical staff and users throughout those sites have gained familiarity with the product and how to make it work for them in the VA context.  In-troducing a different brand would cost the VA to make a substantial investment in retraining both users and technical staff.This purchase will provide compatibility and communication with the larger VA context.  Regions 1, 2, and 4 have already invested heavily in the Citrix product with a total of 16,266 existing licenses.  Region 3 expects to gain the advantage of the synergy of using the same platform across the VA enter-prise.  Citrix has a known capability to meet the following VA requirements:	For protecting WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure (WAPI) -- One of the attrac-tive features of the XenApp product is the ability to minimize the exposure of protected infor-mation.  There are a number of techniques available with the Citrix product for isolating and disposing of electronic data that are much more difficult to implement on a full desktop.   A re-cent SEWP brand name or equal RFI conducted in May 2008 resulted in only one product, the Citrix XenApp product.  	For application compatibility  Over the years that staff at the various facilities and networks in Region 3 have worked with the product technical staff have come to know how to engage the commonly and not so commonly used desktop applications in this context.  Introducing a new layer of software between the operating system, Windows, and the hardware on which the two run at the point of use invariably introduces subtleties in the arena of application workability.  In addition to the skill set developed to make this configuration work is the knowledge of the limits of the configuration.  Of particular import is compatibility with and special features con-figured to support the Sentillion CCOW product in the VA environment for users connections to VA VistA.3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the es-timated value):This acquisition is to restore subscription service to 3,400 Citrix XenApp licenses, add 600 Citrix XenApp licenses, and upgrade 1,500 of the 3,400 licenses to the Platinum level of service for Ci-trix XenApp product (total 4,000 licenses).  This acquisition is a procurement with one base year and three option years.  The total value of the purchase in 4 years is $1,750,433.75.   4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufac-turer and 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is not a sole source justification; rather it is a justification to permit other than full and open competition due to a brand name requirement.5.	Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the ac-quisition requires use of the authority cited:The Citrix XenApp (formerly known as Presentation Server, and Winframe before that) software and servers are already installed around various sites in the region.  Region 3 staff have recently configured a server to take on the role of Citrix license server for the 41 facilities of the region.  Adding Citrix seats to the configuration is deemed a relatively minor upgrade process.  The hard-ware is in place and an earlier version of the product is running at the selected locations. In the market place today there are three protocols that can deliver the virtual desktop environment. They are Independent Computing Architecture (ICA), Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and Vir-tual Network Computing (VNC).  ICA is proprietary, only offered by Citrix.  Among other advan-tages, it offers access to printers local to the user, published applications, and compatibility with imaging applications commonly used by clinicians.Failure to refresh the Citrix XenApp software will result in the desktop environment operating in an unsupported mode at many of the 41 Region 3 sites.  This infrastructure supports all key clinical and administrative applications across the VA and is critical to the delivery of accurate patient care and management of business operations at VA medical centers.By refreshing and upgrading the Citrix software, the VA will be able to take advantage of new fea-tures Citrix has incorporated into the XenApp solution (formerly known as Presentation Server, and Winframe before that) since the original deployment at the various sites.  Of special interest will be application monitoring and analysis and streamlined security capabilities that are available with the Platinum level of service.In comparison to the 4,000 licenses needed by Region 3, Region 1 currently has 5,251 Presentation Server licenses, Region 2 has 6,590 Presentation Server licenses, and Region 4 has 3,055 Presenta-tion Server licenses.  These license numbers show that the VA is already heavily invested in the Ci-trix product.6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:This acquisition will be solicited under the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Solution Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), to all SEWP contract holders (this includes multiple small, veteran-owned and woman-owned businesses).7.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:Pricing shall be determined fair and reasonable based on competitive quotes, as prescribed in FAR 16.505 (b)(1)(ii)(E).8.	Description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:Market Research was conducted on the SEWP portal.  Currently, Nine SEWP vendors offer the Ci-trix XenApp software on their contracts:  Apptis, Blue Tech, GTSI, Gov Connect, PC Mall Gov d/b/a GMRI, FCN Technology Solutions, Dell, IGov, and WWT.  On May 1, 2008, an RFI an-nouncement #31036 was posted on SEWP as an RFI seeking alternative products for the Citrix XenApp brand name or equal product.     The RFI included a description of the general and tech-nical requirements.  GTSI is the only vendor that responded to the RFI providing no alternative products.  9.	Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  A recent SEWP brand name or equal RFI #31036 was posted on May 1, 2008 resulted in only one product, the Citrix XenApp product.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information from commercial vendors that are capable of providing a piezoelectric drop-on-demand materials deposition printer system.  This system will be used to support a  time-critical research program to produce standard materials for calibration of explosive and narcotics trace detection instruments deployed throughout the United States in support of Homeland Security. The printer is needed for precision delivery of high-explosive and narcotic solutions on a variety of substrates including floppy disks, simulated luggage, cloth and paper. A critical requirement for this deposition system is the integration of a precision mass measurement capability. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsuquently award a Purchase Order. If 2 or more small businesses are determined to be capable of meeting the requirements set forth herein, NIST will conduct the complete procurement as a small business set-aside.

NIST has a need for a materials deposition printer that would meet the following requirements:

Overall  System Requirements

•	The system must be able to dispense droplets-on-demand (in various modes such as single, burst, continuous, and on-the-fly) on media supported on a stage such that patterns may be applied.  The stage must be able to support media with dimensions up to 8.5 x 11” and 2” in height. Ejected droplet sizes of  40-60 micrometers in diameter are required for this application. Typical viscosities of the jetted solutions are less than 20 cP.


Mass Measurement Functionality Requirements

•	The station must have functionality that allows gravimetric determination of dispensed droplet mass (mass-on-demand) with a sensitivity of 0.1 ug. 
This capability must be fully integrated into the instrument control software. This requirement is the most critical for the NIST application. Specific requirements of this functionality are listed below. 

Gravimetric Functionality
Physical
1.	A suitable electronic balance must be incorporated that allows mass-on-demand determination of dispensed droplets.  This may be the average mass in a burst or continuous stream of dispensed droplets.  
2.	The resolution of the electronic balance must be 0.1 microgram or below, and be accessible for routine calibration and maintenance.
3.	The electronic balance must be rugged and stable enough to withstand the vibrations and stage movements that may normally occur in the system.  If recalibration would be required sooner than normally recommended by the balance manufacturer, this must be stated in the proposal.
4.	Other than changing weighing boats or performing routine maintenance duties, the user shall not need to modify the station from its normal physical configuration in order to achieve mass-on-demand.
5.	Because semi-volatile fluids will be used in the system, evaporative effects will be an issue in the mass measurements.  These effects must be controlled and minimized by appropriate design of the system.  This may include high-walled weighing boats and vapor saturation chambers, but the vendor is welcome to consider other options.

Software
1.	Software that controls the electronic balance must be completely integrated into the system software, which must be compatible with MS Windows. 
2.	If the electronic balance has operating options that include internal refresh rate and stability controls, these must be accessible through the software.
3.	Mass-on-demand (MOD) must be a subroutine for inclusion into method scripts, and must have the following user-selected parameters:
a.	Fluid used (and specific gravity)
b.	Ejection rate (in Hz)
c.	Ejection mode (burst or continuous)
d.	Reading interval (in seconds)
e.	Number of intervals per measurement
f.	Measurement table (to select measurement types, such as weighing during stabilization or evaporation or jetting)
g.	Tolerance (sequential interval weighing stability needed before proceeding to next step in measurement table)
4.	Results from mass-on-demand must correct for evaporative effects, and include nanograms per drop, picoliters per drop, and standard uncertainties from the replicated measurements.  
5.	MOD results must be displayed on the computer monitor in real time, as well as sent to a printer and stored on the hard drive in a suitable format for later retrieval.

Hardware Requirements

•	The sample stage must  be able to print on items weighing at least 10 pounds.

•	Stage travel must be able to accommodate materials with dimensions of 8.5 x 11” and 2” in height. Printable area should be at least 10 x 10 inches. 

•	The sample stage shall have a  mechanism to  hold samples flat with the stage surface.

•	Absolute positioning of the stage is required to allow droplet deposition onto selectable areas of various samples. After registration, the system shall be  capable of delivering individual droplets within  25  micrometers of a predefined location (at room temperature). 

•	Pneumatic control of the pressure/vacuum system shall be controlled and digitally monitored with a  precision of at least 2 mbar. 

•	The printing area shall be fully enclosed to prevent outside contamination of the printed standards.

•	Vibration isolation of the stage is required.


Printing Modes/Software Control

•	Both vector and raster printing modes are required. 

•	Print on the fly and drop-on-demand modes are required.

•	Instrument control software must allow for input of user supplied printing arrays/patterns.

•	The software must  allow the user complete control over the printing parameters including adjustment of all waveform parameters.

•	The system shall be capable of printing dilute explosive and narcotics solutions in water, isobutanol and acetonitrile. Typical viscosities are less than 20 cp with surface tensions of 20-70 dynes/cm.

•	Vendor must supply documentation that the printhead can produce drops with a drop-to-drop volume variability of less than 2%.  A primary use of the printer system is to print dilute solutions of high explosives in isobutanol. If possible,  documentation of the drop-to-drop variability should be conducted with isobutanol.

•	A solid state charge coupled camera system with strobe light illumination is required for visualization of inkdrop formation.

•	A solid state charge coupled  camera for real time visualization of the substrate to be printed is required

<RESPDATE>073108
<CONTACT>Karen L Christian, Phone (816)426-7286, Email karen.l.christian@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 8 each of the Feed Supporting Waveguide, ASC Signal P/N 171747X, (formerly Andrew Corporation) NSN: 5985-01-411-7618. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. BACKGROUND: ASC Signal (Andrew Corporation) brand antennas are installed at 168 Weather Service Radar (WSR-88D) radar sites. These antennas have a Feed Supporting Waveguide manufactured by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), ASC Signal (Andrew Corporation) and are required for spare stock at the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO. The Feed Supporting Waveguide is specifically for use in the antenna installed in the NEXRAD radar system. The unique characteristics and physical form of this assembly makes it the only acceptable part for this application. SPECIFIC TECHNICAL FEATURES: This particular feed supporting waveguide is application specific and the design of the assembly is the intellectual property of ASC Signal (Andrew Corporation). Because the design is the intellectual property of ASC Signal (Andrew Corporation), neither the Government nor any other outside entity has access to the specific design features. The form, fit, and function of this assembly is driven by the design of the next higher assembly, which the antenna itself. The Government has no design rights to the antenna, but does have limited design documentation. The limited documentation carries a restriction against providing this information to any third parties without the written consent of ASC Signal. The legality of duplicating the design impacts the cost of such an effort. The NWS cannot provide a third party with design documentation needed to support the manufacture of this part. The data would have to be measured from an actual unit. It is not clear whether this would also be an infringement of ASC Signal's design right, but the costs would likely triple the costs of the units. The NWS performed a market research and found there are no substitute part numbers or manufacturers identified through the search. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The anticipated award date shall be within 15 calendar days after the date of this publication. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product. Interested firms must submit support documents if providing or proposing to provide other than the specified feed supporting waveguide that meets the same fit, form and function as the specified part number. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification of registration in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). This is a Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs) process. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered with CCR. For more information and to register with the CCR and ORCA, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://www.bpn.gov. In order to register with the CCR and ORCA offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) colorimetric or explosive detection equipment (EDE) requiring visual interpretation by the operator.  Interpretation of resulting colors or changes can be automated or performed by the operator.  The EDE needs to be capable of determining the presence of explosives in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that are contained in mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and on personnel.  This market survey solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance.  NAVEODTECHDIV plans to select EDE systems for comparative testing and evaluation.  A report will be written and made available for use by government agencies and military services.  Technologies for IED detection that protect the force and prevent terrorist bombings against military personnel, equipment, and military installations by finding them at points of entry are sought.  Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to find IEDs effectively and reliably, while inspecting mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and personnel (to include personal articles carried by personnel) for IEDs at military installations' entry points without slowing throughput.  Our intent is to test technologically mature and market ready equipment.  Currently, we plan to test and evaluate up to eight systems. 
The following performance parameters will be assessed throughout the test: 
1.0 Detection Effectiveness
1.1 The IED may include the following explosives: ANFO, RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, SEMTEX, chlorates, water gels, black powders, smokeless powders, perchlorates, peroxides, and dynamites.

<a href="mailto:Leo.Fratis@amedd.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command on behalf of the Critical Reagents Program (CRP) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) for a 3-month, firm-fixed-price contract.  The purpose of this acquisition is to fulfill Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) requirements for carrier box assemblies (CBAs) to support both CONUS and OCONUS operations, as well as Foreign Military Sales.  JBPDS is is intended to detect the presence of airborne Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and identify the type of agent where the system is deployed.  BWA detection depends on the detection capability of immunoassay strips found inside the JPBDS CBA.  The CRP is currently the provider of JBPDS CBAs; San Antonio Scientific, previously the supplier of the immunodetection strips used in JBPDS CBAs produced by Battelle, is now contracted as the sole production facility for JBPDS carriers.  The contract with Battelle will fulfill an interim requirement for JBPDS CBAs pending award of a competitively awarded contract.  If JBPDS CBAs are not acquired from Battelle then more than 300 JBPDS fielded CONUS, OCONUS, and U.S. allies sites will be unable to protect the warfighter and the nation from BWA attack.  This contract action shall be issued usinig the statutory authority permitting acquisition of these items by other than full and open competition detailed in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2(a)(2), which specifies that full and open competition is not necessary when the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling nature that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.  Due to the specialized nauture of building the JBPDS CBAs it would take an unacceptable amount of time and cost to stand up the new production facility.  The need for JBPDS CBAs is immediate and can only be fulfilled by Battelle..  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services without unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements must respond by 25 July 2008, and furnish, in writing, factual information, which clearly supports and demonstrates that their facility is sufficiently able to produce quailified JBPDS CBAs.  This information must be e-mailed to Leo Fratis at Leo.Fratis@us.army.mil or faxed to his attention at (301)619-5069 by close of business 25 July 2008.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a request for quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 721110; size standard $6.5 M.</p>
<p>IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES</p>
<p>A. The following items will be provided:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001:<br />Description: Exhibit booth space (8' X 10')<br />Qty: Twenty-one (21)</p>
<p>B. Period of Performance: 15 Sep 2008 through 17 Sep 2008</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Marriott Wardman Park Hotel and the Omni Sheraton Hotel have been selected to host this year's CSTEA participants. The CSTEA has been scheduled for 10-18 September 2008. Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception. As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-one competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements. The Air Force Association (AFA) has selected the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel to host the AFA National Convention. AFMA planning committee has determined that it is in the Government's better interest to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place. The AFA has leased the entire Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for 15-17 September 2008 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel. During CSTEA 2008, the AFA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA National Convention and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel. The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA National Convention as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement. The AFA convention is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists. Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment. The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA's CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program. Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Marriott/Omni vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation number is RFQ626629 and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.    This is a small business set-aside.

The Technology Transfer offices within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Human Genome Research Institute, two Institutes of the National Institutes of Health , for purposes of this RFQ herein referred to as Neurology and Genome Technology Transfer Offices (NGTTO) is seeking a single Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system capable of meeting NGTTO’s combined requirements for managing technology transfer data and documents from the two Institutes respective Technology Transfer Offices. 

I.  INTRODUCTION
NGTTO supports their intramural and extramural research programs by facilitating collaborations between researchers within the Institutes and with external research and development organizations. NGTTO utilizes scientific, legal and business expertise to negotiate agreements with academic and nonprofit institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and other government agencies. NGTTO serves as the Institute’s official repository for these agreements and is responsible for the management of the Institute's patent portfolios and related expenses and serves as the resource for all of the Institutes issues concerning intellectual property. In addition, NGTTO also manages receipt of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) funds (supports NIH's licensing program, and tracks license royalty receipts and provides investigators with training on NIH technology transfer policies, regulations and processes.  A CRADA is a written agreement between a federal research organization and one or more federal or non-federal parties (collaborators) to work together as partners on a research project of mutual interest.
In order to better manage these activities and comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the NGTTO requires a single COTS system of Knowledge Management. This Technology Transfer Knowledge Management System (TTKMS) will also access and incorporate  information at other databases, including (not exclusively) NIH Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), the USPTO, EPO, and others to input data and cross check the accuracy of TTKMS information. NGTTO will assist in supporting TTKMS in attaining software integration services with other relevant NGTTO and NIH systems (as examples NED and N-vision) to the extent required by this project. NGTTO will provide a managed hosting environment for the database system.  N-Vision is the financial and reporting system used by NIH.  NED is the web-based employee information database.  

II  PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to procure and implement a single Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system capable of meeting NGTTO’s combined requirements for managing its technology transfer data and documents. The scope of the intended system is to meet the data management for all NGTTO technology transfer activities in a single system. 
II.a. - The records and documents handled include, transactional agreements, patent correspondence, license and royalty monitoring, publication, and special consulting projects. 
II.b. - The TTKMS system must take in data from NIH’s centralized Office of Technology Transfer (directly or through N-vision) on a daily or weekly basis and allow comparison of that data with the information within NGTTO’s database. 
II.c. - The system must also be able to check with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) websites to obtain information from those databases on patents maintained for NGTTO.
II.d. - The system must allow users across NGTTO to use a web based portal for accessing standard forms (not exclusively, e.g. material transfer and invention reporting forms) to track tasks, information and agreements.
II.e. - The TTKMS system must be able to generate standard correspondence and forms using data from the database and provide notification alarms of critical dates for patenting or information gathering.
II.f. - Documents in various formats ( pdf, jpg, etc) should be able to be linked to specific records. 
II.g - A standard and query style reporting capability is essential.  Ability to allow various customers direct access to standardized reports on their own specific docket is required.

The system shall provide tracking and organization of invention disclosures, licenses, patents during and after prosecution, funded transactional agreements like CRADAs, Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs), and Confidentiality Disclosure Agreements (CDAs) and also non-funded transactional agreements. The system must also be capable of inventor uploading of invention disclosures, investigator uploading of MTA and CDA information, tracking important dates across the database, email reminders and alarms to inform individual NGTTO staff of important events. Further the system must be capable of tracking Special Projects (extramural, consulting, and marketing) as well as funding associated with agreements, licenses and patent costs. The system must also be capable of using Adobe PDF forms for inputting data and other NGTTO/NIH compatible programs. Further the system must be able to import files (PDF, Word or other formats), link documents to records, document preparation using form letters and database fields, printing of Adobe PDF or MS word forms and document version control management, manage workflow by projects, and individual staff, tracking of daily actions and the ability to send e-mail notifications of critical dates to staff and list action items required of the particular office staff per document. The system must be capable of performing retrievals or searches using Fuzzy Logic, Stemming, Wildcards, Boolean Operators, and Proximity Searches. The TTKMS should be able to generate a variety of reports based on the following: actions and status for Inventions, actions and status for all types of agreements, actions and status for Special Projects actions and status for Activities over a given time period; as applied to any given company or institution; by a given user; by a group of users; and be able to export the reports to NGTTO compatible spreadsheets or applications. In addition, the system must allow customizable permissions such as administrator functions and rights; system management requirements; making global changes; remote access; and customizable levels of security so that different groups can be given access to subsets of data.

Contracting Activity:  Headquarters, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), SDDC Contracting Center, 709 Ward Drive, Bldg 1990, Scott Air Force Base, IL  62225<BR>B.  Description of Action:  The purpose of this action is to renew license agreement through a purchase order on a Brand Name basis, to renew NAVTEQ Premium United States, Hawaii, and Canada quality map data in (NAVTEQ) Shape-File format.  The contract that is currently in place is W81GYE-07-P-0103 and is a firm fixed price contract.  TWCF funds are available for this purpose.<BR>C.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The proposed contract will allow the continuation of United States, Hawaii, and Canada map data in Shape-File format, as well as the expended/enhanced Points of Interest (POI) for the United States and Canada.  This data is for Intelligent Road and Rail Information Server (IRRIS).  The digital map data features - road geometry contains dozens of road attributes for every kilometer, from speed restrictions to lane configurations.  IRRIS has integrated the routing capability of NAVTEQ in with numerous other transportation datasets and attributed the specific Military Convoy routes.  The network allows users to create origin to destination routes in web application.  It also offers users Point of Interest (POI) for the United States and Canada.  The Points of Interest along the route include approximately 12 million points of interest.  They include shopping centers, gas stations, hotels, schools, hospitals, fire, police and other emergency response information, etc.  The data enables turn-by-turn directions.  The network allows users to create origin to destination routes in web applications.    The data is received in ArcView Premium Shape-File format.  The Points of Interest are used to effectively analyze and respond to emergency situations.  IRRIS uses this data for automated alert notifications.  For example, certain shipments are restricted from stopping near certain retail facilities.  The POIs are needed to perform spatial analysis on shipments, compare locations of shipments to restricted facilities and send out an automated alert to the Operations Center and the Defense Transportation Tracking Service (DTTS) of the violation should one occur.  <BR>D.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority is 10.U.S.C 23304(1) as implemented by FAR6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. <BR>E.  Reason for Authority Cited:  The IRRIS project at SDDCTEA has been in development and production over 8 years.  Re-tooling and re-programming for an application other then NAVTEQ would result in significant costs far exceeding the acquisition price of this requirement.  The impacts include NAVTEQ data integration into the IRRIS production application and National Bridge Inventory (NBI) integration activities with the IRRIS application.  Use of different applications would require significant re-tooling of the IRRIS application to support multiple sources in lieu of the NAVTEQ comprehensive source.  The IRRIS routing engine has been tested and matched to NAVTEQ data as an important feature of the IRRIS application and re-tooling to an alternate application would require significant development and testing and would not achieve the accuracy of the current NAVTEQ data.  NAVTEQs data collection methodology using GPS and driving provides an accurate source of ground truth positioning and most closely aligns with positioning specifications of the IRRIS tracking application.<BR>1.  IRRIS integrates and is required to maintain compatibility with the National Geospatial and Intelligence (NGA) Palenterra application Homeland Defense.  <BR>2.  NAVTEQ has over 60 countries to date with full routing and turn by turn navigation attributions which are essential components for accurate IRRIS tracking and routing.  NGA has standardized on NAVTEQ data for both Homeland Defense and the source for worldwide routing and navigation.  This affords the Army superior ability in quickly deploying the IRRIS tracking application worldwide. Currently IRRIS is used in North America, has been tested in Western Europe and is planning expansion into the Middle East.  NAVTEQs worldwide coverage affords the Army the greatest flexibility in deploying IRRIS worldwide in response to military deployment activities worldwide.<BR>3.  NAVTEQ has the basic data layer.  The data was coded by GeoDecisions and SDDCTEA personnel.  Significant changes would be required if another application was selected, coding would have to be re-done, the routing system, and the tools within IRRIS that access the data would also have to be recoded. This would involve many man hours, plus a learning curve.  While the conversion was being implemented, IRRIS would be down.  IRRIS has integrated the routing capability of NAVTEQ in with numerous other transportation datasets and attributed the specific Military Convoy routes. <BR>F.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: Sought potential sources that might be available to fulfill this requirement.  This effort was unsuccessful because of the uniqueness of the systems with which the product interfaces. Reviewed Army and DoD IDIQ contracts and Enterprise agreements and found no compatible software or the availability of this item. GSA was also reviewed and there are no available contracts to purchase this or any other compatible software.<BR>G.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Technology will be monitored periodically to determine potential sources. <BR>H.  Market Research:   The internet was used to research companies that provide premium quality map data.  Tele Atlas was located.  A comparison was done and after performing research is was determined that NAVTEQ has the best source of road network data with a focus on data accuracy, data coverage, and the ability to maintain the accuracy of the data as new build-out and new construction occurs.  NAVTEQ was determined to be the only application with the features, compatibility and quality required. No other comprehensive application was found that meets the governments need. <BR>I.  Other Facts:  By continuing the services with NAVTEQ - funding, downtime of IRRIS and manpower will be saved. Should another vendor be awarded this contract, the processes would have to be rewritten. The data structures and formats for the data received would be different.  Not only would the processes have to be rewritten but new software would have to be purchased, new approvals would have to be obtained from DISA and NETCOM and the IRRIS Accreditation would have to be updated.  New approvals and accreditation would be required.  While the conversion of the data was being done, there would be down time.  Downtime of this system is unacceptable as it negatively impacts the tracking of AA&E and OSM shipments in CONUS.<BR>1.  As a result of 9/11 terrorism the National Geospatial and Intelligence Agency (NGA)  Office of Americas which has the charter of Homeland Defense was formed.    <BR>2.  Data testing and analysis was performed by NGA  Office of Americas.  After their research is was determined that NAVTEQ was the best source for this code.  As such, NGA has standardized on NAVTEQ data the Transportation Layer Road Network provider.  As such, all systems like IRRIS that must interact with NGA systems such as Palanterra must use the NAVEQ data so that data will remain aligned and the applications will remain tightly integrated.<BR>3.  Switching to another application at this time is not considered logical based on the additional dollars and risk that would be required, re-programming of code, down time of IRRIS to accomplish the conversion and due to the fact that NAVTEQ data interfaces with University of Tennessee and NGA.  As well as Tele Atlas not having the qualifications that are required to meet SDDCTEAs requirements.

Equipment Description:  The dust collector shall be a single compartment, continuous automatic self-cleaning cloth, pulse-jet dust collector.

Clean air then migrates into an upper clean air plenum and is exhausted through the enclosure discharge opening to the atmosphere.  The filter tubes are cleaned periodically by bursts of dry compressed air which is injected down the insides of the bags.  A venturi mounted inside each bag also assists the compressed air cleaning action.  Only a portion of the total number of bags will be cleaned at one time to prevent interruption of service.  Bags that are not being cleaned shall continue to filter the air for continuous operation.  This solicitation is issued as a Commercial Solicitation under W911RP-08-T-0162.

Note: The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

 HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

<p><br />1. Question: What is the purpose of the 12 meter interconnect cable?<br />Answer: The 12 meter length allows the J-PRIMES Test Facility to locate the amplifier to the large anechoic chamber or smaller EMI/EMC Lab. The cable allows remote control of the amplifier.</p>

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

THIS NOTICE IS AMENDED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
A design that is scalable, reconfigurable and provides an open architecture. An open architecture is characterized as utilizing well-established, non-proprietary standards for interfaces, services, software, and supporting formats. Kindly provide more detailed information as to your definition of open architecture. Are you saying that you can plug any device or instrument into our system and expect it to function. What are these well-established, non-proprietary standards ?
The government does not want a system that can not grow as technology changes or parts need replacing, nor do they want to be locked into vendor proprietary software. For example, if a component/card fails, the government wants to be able to replace this part without having to go back to the vendor for maintenance support. It is expected that a standard interface like USB would be able to be plugged into your system and it will be recognized.

(2) A modular connector and multibus switching architecture, covering at least 100 channels, that supports the use of one-to-one universal adapter cables which do not need to be dedicated to a specific assembly or system, this would require applying the multibus signals without having to breakout parallel lines from the universal adapter cables. We require more details with regard to the “ universal adapter “, Who defines that adapter ? What is the definition of this adapter as well as its operating environment ?
A “universal adapter” is an interface cable / module which adapts the tester connector to the UUT connector with one (contact)-to-one (contact) connectivity.  When using an automatic wiring tester, the tester feature which makes this adapter truly “universal” is multibus switching.  When both test and excitation connections can be made to each or predetermined set of contact(s) in the adapter, then it can truly be called “universal.”  That is because ALL cables / relay boxes / switch panels utilizing that connector can be tested without modification to the adapter (i.e. without breakout or “Y”-off). 

(3) Generating and viewing real time schematics diagrams of the harness under test; If schematics are to begenerated real time ( during the test process ), who generates the layers for the .dxf file ?
Government is not sure what is meant by layers of .dxf file. The harness under test can be ‘learned’ first by the tester and then the schematic can be generated. 

(4) Where ONE power supply, is programmed with ONE output level, then that ONE output is available and selectable by any or all 100 test channels?  OR Is there a different operating scenario?
There needs to be only one power supply.  A voltage will be selected and the sequential stepping will start and that voltage applied whenever the test program call for it.  An additional scenario should be accommodated where different voltages are needed during the course of the program.  Here, the stepping can be paused while the new voltage is called for, and then continue stepping.  Only one voltage will be required at any one time.  

(5) Closing date is 24 July 2008. Can this date be extended out past July 24th ?
Closing date will be extended to 7 AUG 2008.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS ADDED TO PARAGRAPH (7) IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK:

(7) Programmable power supply (0-30VDC, 5 Amp minimum) available to multibus switching for stimulus power for test article components. There needs to be only one power supply.  A voltage will be selected and the sequential stepping will start and that voltage applied whenever the test program call for it.  An additional scenario should be accommodated where different voltages are needed during the course of the program.  Here, the stepping can be paused while the new voltage is called for, and then continue stepping.  Only one voltage will be required at any one time.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Questions and Responses 1 through 37<BR><BR>Question: 1 Page: 2 Para.B.3.1  <BR>B.3.1 Time and Material Labor Hour/Firm Fixed Labor Rates states:<BR><BR>Program Management Support Costs.  Contract-level program management support costs are included as a percentage of each individual labor category rate, and encompass support for contract-level management, reporting requirements (See Section F) and related travel and meeting attendance costs associated with the Contractors program management staff, as it relates to overall management of the BOSS-U.  As a result, these program management support costs are allocated across all of the task orders issued under this contract.<BR><BR>Question- How does the Government envision these costs being reimbursed on a cost reimbursable task?  Would the Government consider allowing these costs to be bid as an ODC on Cost Reimbursable tasks?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>When proposing labor rates under a Cost Reimbursable Task Order the Contract-Level Program Management cost should be incorporated in the G&A rate used to burden the labor rates.<BR> <BR>Question: 2 Page(s): 2, 85 Para.B.3.1.a, L.2.3.e.5 <BR>Section B states that hourly rates will be based on a 40-hour work week (ex. 1920 hours per year or in accordance with the Contractors Cost Accounting (CAS) Disclosure Statement), while the Section L reference states the offeror shall &provide hourly rates based upon a 40-hour work week (1920 hours per year).  Please clarify if all offerors are to 1) base hourly rates on 1920 hours per year, or 2) develop hourly rates based on their CAS disclosure statement. <BR><BR>Response: <BR>All price proposals should be based on 1920 hours.  The RFP language has been revised before release.<BR> <BR>Question: 3 Page: 2 Para.B.3.1.a <BR>In the pricing discussion of section B, the RFP details all the labor-related costs to be included in our burdened labor rates (page 2, B.3.1 (a)).  <BR><BR>Question- Will the Government provide instructions as to how to price shift differential pay and overtime pay in the ID/IQ submission, so that comparable input is provided by all respondents?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>If required, shift differential and overtime pay will be negotiated at the Task Order level.<BR> <BR>Question: 4 Page: 2 Para.B.3.1.a <BR>Paragraph B.3.1(a) cites the following, All hourly rates are based on a 40-hour work week (ex. 1,920 hours per year or in accordance with the Contractors Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Disclosure Statement. However, Paragraph L.2.3(e)(5) only cites the following, Contractor shall provide hourly rates based upon a 40-hour work week (1,920 hours per year).<BR><BR>We suggest that the language in Paragraph L.2.3(e)(5) be modified to match the language in Paragraph B.3.1(a) to provide consistency with a contractors CAS Disclosure Statements.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>All price proposals should be based on 1920 hours.  The RFP language has been revised before release.<BR> <BR>Question: 5 Pages: 2,40 Para.B.3.1, H.29<BR>Attach J4 <BR>For the purpose of determining Government site rates, what are the assumed CONUS work locations?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Washington Capital Region and Clarksburg, West Virginia.  <BR> <BR>Question: 6 Page(s): 2, 85 Para.B.3.1, L.2.3.e.5 <BR>The use of uncompensated overtime is not encouraged.<BR><BR> L  The use of uncompensated overtime is not allowed.  <BR> <BR>Question:  Section B does not use the same language on this subject as that found in Section L.<BR>Are we correct in assuming that the use of uncompensated overtime is disallowed?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Uncompensated overtime will not be allowed under the BOSS-U contract.<BR> <BR>Question: 7 Page: 7 Para.C.1.2<BR>There appears to be some functional category overlap between BOSS-U and BOSS-R, specifically in the management support and technology management areas. How will the Government determine which vehicle will be used for task orders falling in the overlapping areas?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Normal procedures will be followed in accordance with the DFAR, AFAR, FAR and local policies by each Task Order Contracting Officer to determine if the Level of Effort of a TO is suitable for Small Business.         <BR> <BR>Question: 8 Page: 8 Para.C.2.1<BR>Please clarify scope of the services expected under the bullet transformation. <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Support the transition/transformation of DoD Biometrics capabilities, standards, policies, and architectures.<BR> <BR>Question: 9 Page: 8 Para.C.2.1 - C.2.6 <BR>All six functional categories contain sub-functional items. <BR><BR>While the sub-functional elements further delineate the elements within a particular functional category, we suggest that clarifying text be added for each sub-function to minimize uncertainty and potential duplication, while ensuring that proposals meet requirements and expectations.<BR>Response: <BR>Comment has been noted.<BR> <BR>Question: 10 Page: 9 Para.C.2.2 <BR>The list of anticipated activities for Functional Category 2 includes Incidental construction, component/system certification.  Are we correct in assuming that these are two separate functional activities? <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Correct, the elements should be under separate bullets.  The RFP has been modified to reflect the error.<BR> <BR>Question: 11 Page: 12 Para.D.1 <BR>D.1 Packing, Packaging, Marking and Storage of Equipment states:<BR><BR>All initial packing, marking and storage incidental to shipping of equipment to be provided under this contract shall be at the Contractors expense.<BR><BR>This ID/IQ may require the shipping of significant amounts of equipment overseas.<BR><BR>Question- Can this requirement be addressed at the Task Order level, to account for these projects?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Section D.1 has been changed in the RFP to read All initial packing, marking and storage incidental to shipping of equipment to be provided under this contract shall be at the Contractors expense, unless otherwise determined at the Task Order level.<BR> <BR>Question: 12 Page: 13 Para.E.1  <BR>Will the Government consider tailored acceptance criteria for each task order?<BR><BR>Some examples on the need for flexibility- The 30 days to correct a rejected product may not be in the Governments best interest for fast-moving projects. A systems integration task order should be measured on verifiable interfaces created and utilized.  A product should be measured on the degree to which it complies with a relevant specification<BR><BR>Response: <BR>As stated in E.1.c, (c) The Government requires a period not to exceed thirty (30) days after receipt of final deliverable item(s) for inspection and acceptance or rejection, unless otherwise specified in the individual TO.<BR><BR>Question:  Section G.2.4 <BR>Contractors Program Manager states:  The Program Manager shall act as the central point of contact with the Government for all program-wide technical issues, and will represent the Contractor at all post-award status meetings.<BR><BR>Does this apply only to ID/IQ-level (Master Agreement level) status meetings, or to both ID/IQ-level and Task Order-level meetings?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Section G.2.4 will be clarified in the RFP.  It is intended that the Program Manager shall be responsible for all issue resolution, program management, and other contract support including providing comprehensive account support for the BOSS-U contract and all Task Orders issued under the Contract.<BR> <BR>Question: 14 Page: 29 Para.H.2 <BR>(a) Unless exempted by the Contracting Officer (KO), communications after contract award shall be transmitted via electronic mail (e-mail).  This shall include all communication between the Government and the contractor except Classified Information.   Return receipt will be used if a commercial application is available.  <BR>(b) The format for all communication shall be compatible with the following:  <BR>  (1) Microsoft Word 2000 (Not to exceed 20 pages or  megabyte).<BR>  (2) Microsoft Excel 2000 (Not to exceed  megabyte).<BR>  (3) Microsoft PowerPoint 2000 for presentation slides.<BR>(c) Files larger than 2 megabytes must use alternate means of transmission.  (Note:  This includes both the text message and the attachment).  Large files can be submitted in disk format and mailed with the Contracting Officers approval.<BR><BR>What method of delivery is preferred for electronic files greater than  megabyte but smaller than 2 megabytes?<BR>processing, so that Proposals will be developed on a constrained timeline.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Limitations for size of electronic mail will be called out in Task Orders.  Size constraints in H.2.b have been removed. <BR> <BR>Question: 15 Page: 30 Para.H.4(b) <BR>Paragraph H.4(b) states the following, The maximum cumulative dollar ceiling value of all contracts  in this multiple award procurement is established at $497 maximum. However, the Solicitation Notice posted May 12, 2008 indicates $479M, while Solicitation Notice posted on May 23, 2008 indicates $498M.  <BR><BR>Suggest the numbers be aligned to avoid confusion and to best manage expectations.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>The correct contract ceiling value is $497 million<BR> <BR>Question: 16 Page: 30 Para.H.4.b <BR>This statement conflicts with the Boss-U Draft Request for Proposal Notice which states The total estimated value for the BOSS-U requirement is $479 Million.   <BR>Does the government intend to set the ceiling at $497 million or $479 million?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>The correct contract ceiling value is $497 million<BR> <BR>Question: 17 Page: 30 Para.H.4.b  <BR>There is a discrepancy between the contract ceiling value listed in the RFP and the value listed in the May 12, 2008 FBO posting. Is the total contract value $497 million or $479 million?  <BR><BR>Response: <BR>The correct contract ceiling value is $497 million<BR> <BR>Question: 18 Page: 35 Para.H.16 <BR>1. Please clarify what cross-teaming is allowable: <BR>a. Is a single contractor allowed to participate on a team under both the Unrestricted and Restricted BOSS solicitations, either as a prime contractor or subcontractor?  <BR>b. Specifically, may a large business prime under the Unrestricted solicitation and also be a subcontractor to a small business under the Restricted solicitation?  <BR>c. Is a large business allowed to be a subcontractor under both solicitations?  <BR>d. May a business prime and sub on multiple teams under the same solicitation?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>a.  Yes<BR>b.  Yes<BR>c.  Yes<BR>d.  Yes<BR> <BR>Question: 19 Page: 35 Para.H.16 <BR>This section states that the contractor is encouraged to have non-exclusive access to multiple products and service providers.  However, there is nowhere in the proposal for offerors to describe their corporate resources, including the business relationships they have in place to ensure access to multiple products and service providers.  Please indicate where this information should be presented (with appropriate page allowances) and how it will be evaluated.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>It is up to the offerors discretion if and where they may wish to address this in their proposal.<BR> <BR><BR>Question: 20 Page: 35 Para.H.16.a <BR>The referenced section states Prime Contractors may subcontract with other Prime Contractors on an individual TO basis; however, the Government reserves the right to prohibit Prime Contractor teaming on an individual TO basis.  On what basis might the Government prohibit Prime Contractor teaming?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Decisions regarding teaming arrangements after award will be made at the Task Order level.<BR> <BR>Question: 21 Page: 35 Para.H.16.a  <BR>States that Prime Contractors may subcontract with other Prime Contractors on an individual TO basis; however, the Government reserves the right to prohibit Prime Contractor teaming on an individual TO basis.  We expect that the Government will have an expeditious process for Task Order processing, so that Proposals will be developed on a constrained timeline.<BR>Question- Will the Government provide a timeframe in which they would notify the contractor for allowing one PRIME contractor to team with another PRIME contractor on Task Orders?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Due dates for proposal submission is at the discretion of the Task Order Contracting Officer.<BR> <BR>Question: 22 Page: 35 Para.H.16.b <BR>The referenced section states The Contractor is also encouraged to have nonexclusive access to multiple product and service providers.  This statement appears to encourage subs to team with many prime bidders non-exclusively, which could result in many teams consisting of the same key product and service providers.  With little to differentiate the teams from one another, we are unclear what benefit the Government may realize by allowing non-exclusivity to this extent.  Could the government explain the purpose/objective of this provision? <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Under an exclusive arrangement the Government may not be able to provide awardees a fair opportunity to compete for Task Order awards.<BR> <BR>Question: 23 Page: 35 Para.H.17 <BR>The subcontracting goals stated in this section are different than the goals stated in Section M.  Please indicate which set of goals is the correct set.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>The goals displayed in section M are correct.  This reference will be modified.<BR> <BR>Question: 24 Page: 35 Para.H.17 <BR>Under section H.17, the mandatory small business contracting goal is listed as 25%. Do the small business subs (of the prime with NAICS 541611 bidding the effort) have to fit under the NAICS code of 541611 to be a part of meeting this goal? For example, if a sub has a NAICS code of 541710, would the subs work be considered as part of the 25% goal?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>I have been advised by our Small Business Specialist that the subs work would be considered as part of the 25% goal.  <BR> <BR>Question: 25 Page: 35 Para.H.17(b) <BR>Paragraph H.17(b) states, The Small Business Subcontracting Participation Plan reporting will be as required in Section G, Contract Management. This reporting is separate from the Small Business Subcontracting Plan requirement as required for Contractors with a business size designation of large in accordance with Section I, FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, Alt II and DFARS clause 252.219-7003, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DOD Contracts). The draft RFP requires specific small business subcontracting goals and cites FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.<BR><BR>Suggests the RFP be revised to allow DFAR clause 252.219.7004 be substituted for FAR clause 52.219-9.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Section H.17(b) has been removed, and section H.18 has been revised.<BR> <BR>Question: 26 Page: 35 Para.H.20 <BR>H.20. Key Personnel states:<BR>No changes in TO Key Personnel will be made unless the Contractor can demonstrate that the qualifications of prospective replacement personnel are equal to or better than the qualifications of the TO Key Personnel being replaced.<BR><BR>This may cause an unanticipated escalation if a position requires a Masters Degree and a contractor fills it with a person with a PhD. All further replacements must have a PhD, even though it may not be necessary for full performance of the work. This may impact timely fills and may not be in the Governments best interes.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>The intent of the Government is to keep highly qualified personnel in key positions. TO Key personnel will be the responsibility of the TO Contracting Officer.  Minimum qualifications of Key Personnel will be managed at the Task Order level.   <BR> <BR>Question: 27 Page(s): 35, 36, 80_ Para.H.20.1/2, L.2.2.1.b   <BR>Is the Program Manger considered the only Key Person for the IDIQ master contract?<BR><BR>If not, what are the criteria for being designated Key Personnel on the IDIQ master contract?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>As of now, the Program Manager is the only identified Key Person for the ID/IQ master contract.<BR> <BR>Question: 28 Page: 36 Para.H.20 <BR>The second paragraph on this page addresses key personnel designations and defines how key personnel are identified under TO responses.  Specifically, subparagraph (b) states; Personnel whose resumes were submitted with the TO proposal.  With the understanding that TO Statements of Work will vary in management, technical, and staffing requirements and a Contractors response to a TO may require justification of providing appropriate staff experience the referenced subparagraph would dictate that any resume included under a TO response would be declared a key personnel resource.  As subparagraph (a) captures the ability for the government to designate key personnel positions for the TO and subparagraph (c) captures the ability for the government and contractor to negotiate key personnel positions, would the government consider deleting subparagraph (b)?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>H.20 has been revised in the RFP.<BR> <BR>Question: 29 Page: 42 Para.H.35 <BR>In Section H. 35 License Rights, the Government incorporates DFARS 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, which requires the contractor to assign copyrights of works first produced under this contract to the Government.<BR><BR>The draft RFP also incorporates DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items, and 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. These provide the Government unlimited rights to the same IP. <BR><BR>We believe that the Government will want to promote the use of innovative technology in this contract. Past DoD-sponsored studies have indicated that the potential loss of IP rights has deterred companies, especially non-traditional DoD contractors and small businesses, from providing cutting-edge technologies to the Government. It is believed that as a general policy, contractors are permitted to retain ownership (e.g., title) of the IP that they develop or deliver under DoD contracts; and that normally DoD receives only a (nonexclusive) license to use that IP  the scope of the license depends on the nature of the data, the relative source of funding for development, and negotiation between the parties. Additionally, the exact nature of the work to be performed under the contract is not fully known at this time and may vary greatly from an IP rights perspective.<BR><BR>Question- Would the Government consider removing the DFARS 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, from the Master Agreement and invoke this only when needed, on an individual Task Order basis?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>This clause will remain in Section H.35 of the RFP.<BR> <BR>Question: 30 Page: 46 Para.H.43.d.2 <BR>H.43 Continued Performance during Support of Crisis Situations, Contingency or Exercise (d)(2) states:<BR><BR>If a Contractor employee departs an area of operations without Contractor permission, the Contractor shall ensure continued performance in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  If the Contractor replaces an employee who departs without permission, the replacement is at Contractor expense and must be in place within five days or as directed by the KO.<BR><BR>Providing a replacement in place in Iraq or a similar location within five days may not be possible due to CONUS Replacement Center (CRC) timelines, government transportation limitations, etc.<BR><BR>Question- Can the timeliness requirement be addressed at the Task Order level?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>H.43.d..2 Language reads or as directed by the KO.  Consequently, the TO KO can make a change as they determine necessary.<BR> <BR>Question: 31 Page: 65 Para.H.16 <BR>Are we correct in assuming, for purposes of submitting a response to the IDIQ RFP, Prime Contractors may not be on other Prime Contractors teams?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>There is no constraint precluding a Prime contractor being a sub-contractor on another Prime Contractor team.<BR> <BR>Question: 32 Page: 71 Para.J-4 <BR>On the pricing template, category number 37 repeats the Quality Assurance Specialist as Level III on site and off site two times.<BR> <BR>Should the second Quality Assurance Specialist instead be listed as either a level II or a level IV?  Please clarify<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Correction has been made to Quality Assurance Specialist Category in J-4 to identify levels as being II and III.<BR> <BR>Question: 33 Page: 71 Para.J-4 <BR>The Labor Categories and Qualifications Education and Experience Level Matrix contain just one matrix for all labor categories  exempt, nonexempt, and management.  Level 1 requires only a High School diploma or GED Certification and 1 year of experience.  For many of the exempt jobs, the RFP job descriptions start at Level I.  It will be nearly impossible to find an Application Systems Analyst with just a High School Diploma and 1 year of experience.  Industry expects a Bachelors degree. <BR> <BR>Since we are mapping exempt and management categories based on the above logic, please clarify whether you will be updating the matrix in Attachment J-3 to more accurately to reflect industry? This guidance will save future confusion and help level the playing field in case other competitors are following the above matrix exactly as defined.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Comment has been noted.<BR> <BR>Question: 34 Page: 73 Para.J-3 <BR>In the attachment J-3, Labor Category Table, there are no levels provided for the Facility Maintenance Tech and Facility Mgr (pages J3-5&6).  <BR><BR>Question - If labor rates need to be provided, what is the minimum education and years of experience requirements for these positions?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>A change has been made to J-3 to identify the appropriate qualification levels.<BR> <BR>Question: 35 Page: 73 Para.J3-1/12 <BR>Section J - List of Attachments on page 73 of the DRFP lists attachment J-3 as Pricing Table. However, the actual attachment provided shows J3-1 as Labor Categories and Qualifications.<BR><BR>Suggest renaming the J3 Pricing Table entry on page 73 to match the J3-1 page, titled Labor Categories and Qualifications.  <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Changes have been incorporated to Section J of the RFP.<BR><BR>Question: 36 Page: 73 Para.J4-1/11 <BR>Section J - List of Attachments on page 73 of the DRFP lists attachment J4 as Pricing Model. However, the actual attachments provided shows J4-1 as Price Table. <BR><BR>Suggest renaming the J-4 Pricing Model entry on page 73 to match the J4-1 page, titled Price Table.  <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Changes have been incorporated to Section J of the RFP.<BR> <BR>Question: 37 Page(s): 79, 82 Para.L.1.d, L.2.2.3 <BR>The proposal content table shown on page 79 of the draft RFP shows that the maximum number of pages allowed for Part 4  Small Business Participation Plan is 5.  Paragraph L.2.2.4 requires the following to be included in Part 4 of the proposal: (1) percentage of subcontracts planned for, (2) ACO rating, SF295 information, etc., and (3) a Small Business Participation Plan containing the elements required by FAR 52.219-9.  Please clarify in the final RFP which portions of the material required to be submitted as part of Part 4  Small Business Participation are counted in the allotted 5 pages, or it is recommended the Maximum Number of Pages shown in the Proposal Content table on page 79 for Part 4 be changed to read no limit.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Page limit for Small Business Participation Plan has been changed to 15 pages.<BR> <BR>

<DESC>Questions and Responses 38 to 80<BR><BR>Question: 38 Page(s): 79, 84 Para.L.1.d, L.2.2.4.2 <BR>The Volume 2 page limitations shown on Page 79 do not appear to allow for the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, as required in Volume 2 per Page 84.  Will the Government add pages to the Volume 2 page limitation to allow for the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or should offerors include the Small Business Subcontracting Plan in Volume 3?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>A page requirement for the Small Subcontracting Plan has been incorporated into L.1 of the RFP and will be part of the Volume 2 submission requirement. <BR> <BR>Question: 39 Page(s) : 78, 91 Para.L.2.2.4, M.4.4<BR> <BR>Section K establishes the NAICS code for this acquisition as 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a small business size standard of $6.5M. This code would seem more appropriate to the Functional Categories in the BOSS-R acquisition. The Functional Categories in BOSS-U appear to be more closely related to the engineering and R&D activities described in NAICS 541330, Engineering Services (Military Equipment) with a small business size standard of $25M..<BR>" Will the government change the NAICS code to one that reflects the technical nature of the Functional Categories in the BOSS-U Performance Work Statement?<BR>" Does this NAICS code establish the small business size standard for subcontractors to qualify as small businesses per the references in Section L and Section M?<BR>" Are all subcontractors required to have the NAICS 541611 or is it only the Prime that must meet this requirement?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>The NAICS code isnt going to change.<BR>I have been advised by our Small Business Specialist that subs work would be counted toward the 25% goal even if sub does not have NAICS 541611. <BR> <BR>Question: 40 Page: 79 Para.L.1 <BR>There are no references to a contract master schedule in Section L.2 or Section M.  Normally there is not a Contract Master Schedule (CMS) associated with an IDIQ contract.  <BR>A) Are we correct in assuming that a CMS is not required for the IDIQ contract? <BR>B) If the Government requires a CMS in the master IDIQ contract, please define what is to be in the CMS and in which section it is to be included.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>A CMS is not required for the ID/IQ master contract.  The reference has been removed.<BR> <BR>Question: 41 Page: 79 Para.L.1 <BR>Is the response to the Sample TOs included in the Part 1  Technical Approach (50) page count? <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Sample Task Orders have been removed.

If so, please consider exempting the sample PWS responses from the page limitation or increasing the page limitation.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Sample task orders have been removed from the RFP.<BR> <BR>Question: 45 Page: 79 Para.L.1.3.d <BR>Please consider increasing the page count for Part 2, Management Approach.  The instructions require offerors to address eight crucial management activities, meaning offerors have, on average, less than two pages per topic.  While the instructions for each topic imply that offerors should provide a detailed response (e.g., The offeror shall provide a QCP that details how the offeror intends to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies&), the page limitation will precludes more than a superficial response.  At a minimum, we suggest that you exempt the QCP from the 15-page limit.<BR><BR>Response: <BR>The Part 2 Management Approach page limit has been increased to 25 pages in the RFP.  The Management Approach language has been changed.<BR> <BR>Question: 46 Page: 79 Para.L.1.3.d  <BR>The Proposal Content table on page 79 limits Part 3, Past Performance, to a maximum number of only five pages.

Please clarify in the final RFP whether the 5 pages are allowed for each individual contractual past performance presented in the proposal or the total number of pages allowed for Volume 2, Part 3  Past Performance.  Inasmuch as paragraph L.2.2.3 (3), page 82 requires past performance information, for any proposed subcontractor who will perform a significant portion of the effort, this offeror assumes that 5 pages are allowed for each individual contractual past performance described in the proposal.  Please clarify in the final RFP. <BR><BR>Response: <BR>Maximum page count will be extended to 15 pages in L.1.3.d<BR> <BR>Question: 52 Page: 80 Para.L.2.1 <BR>The lead paragraph in this section says that Volume 1 will consist of three parts but identifies only two parts.

In order to be fair to RFP respondents such that all will have access to the same information, has any bidders library or other documentation been or can be provided? <BR><BR>Response: <BR>The only information provided is via FedBizOps and the Army Single Face to Industry.  Any Task Orders to be issued after award of the contract will be conducted through fair opportunity per FAR 16.505. <BR> <BR>Question: 98 Page: J3-1 Para.J - Column 6 Header <BR>Are we correct in assuming this should this read Minimum Experience?<BR><BR>Response: <BR>Correct.  The title should read Minimum Experience.<BR> <BR>Question: 99 Page: J-6-1 Para.J-6 <BR>It is unclear when the contractor is to complete and submit Attachment J-6.

One obvious qualified source being considered is the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) of West Virginia University. In conducting our assessment we have found that the Department of Defense Biometric Task Force is an affiliate member of CITeR as are several other DoD organizations and commercial enterprises. The CITeR publicly states that the key to its success is the participation by its affiliates. As such, through the BTFs membership and affiliation with CITeR, by having CITeR proposed as part of any proposed team would literally be creating a situation whereby BTF would be a party participating in a proposal being submitted to and to be evaluated by the BTF. That being the case, we are concerned that having the CITeR join our team or support our proposal effort in any manner would be a clear and unequivocal conflict of interest under FAR Part 9.5. <BR><BR>Will you please provide us with a Conflict of Interest determination in this regard? Further, would a bidders use of this qualification or capability of being a affiliate of CITeR be considered as a legitimate competitive advantage and afford it a higher rating to its proposal in that BTF and DoD would essentially be rating its own capabilities? <BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>Any determination for Conflict of Interest will be made on a case-by-case basis after receipt of proposals.<BR><BR><BR>Question: 103 Page: General Para.<BR><BR>It is our understanding that West Virginia Universitys CITeR is a non-profit organization formed under the various applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. One fundamental requirement of obtaining and maintaining such favorable regulatory treatment is that any such organization must benefit the broadest community of interest and cannot be partial to any commercial interest(s). Further, by regulation, there can be no inherent advantage to any commercial party or preferential treatment of one commercial interest over another by virtue of a party being a member or not being a member in any such association. Specifically, through the performance of particular services for its member organizations an organization (such as CITeR) disqualifies itself for tax-exemption under the Internal Revenue Code(s). <BR><BR>In discussing CITeRs availability and ability to support any offerors proposal on the BOSS procurement, CITeR has indicated that they would only support the proposal efforts of parties who are members or affiliates of CITeR. We believe that this exclusionary practice is in direct conflict with the regulations which grant the CITeR favorable treatment under IRS regulations. <BR><BR>Will you please clarify this matter?<BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>Teaming arrangement are at the discretion of individual contractor organizations.<BR><BR>Question: 104 Page: General Para.<BR><BR>Under Section H.17, Small Business Subcontracting Goals (a)  A mandatory small business subcontracting goal of 25% of the total contract value is stipulated.

In addition, goal percentage reporting requirements per the FAR and as outlined on the SF294 and SF295 are listed as a percentage of total subcontract value (dollars).

In order to receive the most current information relating to A-SpaceX we ask that all potential performers be registered with A-SpaceX management team by sending an e-mail with your contact information and affiliation to: DNI-IARPA-ASPACEX@UGOV.GOV.  All A-SpaceX Industry attendees are already registered.  Parties seeking one-on-one communications should send an e-mail to the A-SpaceX management team at: DNI-IARPA-ASPACEX@UGOV.GOV . When appropriate, please indicate if the subject of the communications relates to contractual questions or technical questions by including the keyword: CONTRACT or TECHNICAL in the email subject line.  

Background.  
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), on behalf of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) hosted an Industry Day July 8, 2008 prior to soliciting proposals for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for the Analysis WorkSpace for Exploitation (A-SpaceX) program. The anticipated BAA will address Phase 1 of what is being conceived as a multi-phase program. A BAA is expected to be released following the Industry Day, and will provide additional details regarding the research opportunities within this program. The BAA will solicit proposals for conducting critical research and development for what is planned as the first phase of a multi-phase, multi-million dollar program. Phase 1 will have an expected performance period of 18 months, and would culminate with a technology showcase for the benefit of potential users and system integrators. Succeeding phases would focus on developing integrated systems.  Formal proposals will be reviewed by an IARPA selection committee based on source selection criteria to be published as part of the BAA. Separate proposals may be submitted for different requirements with the thrust areas, e.g., Time Machine and MindSnaps. We anticipate initial contract awards will be made by the first quarter of 2009.  AFRL is expected to be the Contracting Authority for the planned work, while IARPA will be responsible for technical oversight and the BAA solicitation process.

Overview: 
A-SpaceX is seeking to create an analytic environment where the workspace becomes an enabler for the analytic process – fostering creativity and effective analytic reasoning. A-SpaceX envisions two key emerging technologies being fused for the intelligence analyst workstation of the future: Virtual worlds, and Workflow management. 

Analysts will work with an integrated workstation that not only allows access to the legacy tools of today, but any number of virtual worlds designed to support the analytic process. Virtual worlds are defined here as: 1) Complex multi-dimensional digital environments (i.e. models) that are shared across many users; 2) They may incorporate data models from a variety of sources, made up of objective data as well as hypothetical and/or theoretical constructs; and 3) Both persist and evolve whether or not any individual user is actively engaged with that world. A-SpaceX will demonstrate that this technology affords transformational opportunities to change the way people work in general, and how analysts will work in particular. Synthetic worlds will be multi-dimensional, dynamic visualizations of data tailored to support different analytic problems. A-SpaceX anticipates focusing of the development of two Synthetic worlds that will: 1) Highlight the dynamic aspects of both factual and synthetic (hypothetical) data and models and the benefits of combining them in an integrated representation that provides a meaningful context; 2) Allows the changes in the data to be systematically explored so as to facilitate both forensic and proactive analysis; 3) Show the dynamic aspects of cognition, specifically the process of thinking about data as reflected by capturing decision states that can serve as mental bookmarks for the analytic process; and 4) Demonstrate how groups of analysts can collaborate in the exploration of data and the sharing of analytic strategies. 

The A-SpaceX vision allows for multiple synthetic worlds, each of which is optimized to support different kinds of analytic decision-making. Multiple synthetic worlds will be optimized for different analytic problems. The incorporation of multiple, coherent virtual worlds will require that there be a consistent set of protocols and usability standards to ensure that analysts may readily jump from one world to the next as needed to support exploring complex, inter-related data. 
Implicit in the A-SpaceX vision is premise that changes in the data used in defining a synthetic world will be available to automated agents working on behalf of the analyst to both find relevant information, and highlight when the data (already integrated into analytic products derived from that synthetic world) have changed. Accommodation for legacy software applications and analytic tools will be integrated into the workspace through the incorporation of “proximal displays” located on desktops close to the analysts, while exploration in parallel synthetic worlds will be available through “distal displays” on the periphery of the analyst’s workspace will serve as windows into the synthetic world. Though used for different purposes, the proximal and distal displays will be part of a single integrated digital desktop so that no matter how physical displays are used, the moving of information from one display area to another is as seamless as possible. 

Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program as currently conceived will have two major thrusts: 1) The research and development of key science and technologies to create a “Time Machine” synthetic world that allows complex data to be explored in a rich context, as well as allowing changes in data to be explored over time.  2) The research and development of science and technologies for tracking an analysts workflow to derive “MindSnaps”, or mental bookmarks that reflect key aspects of an analyst’s decision-making process in conducting analyses, as well as the development of a Decision Space virtual world designed to enable and analyst’s visualizing his or her own analytic process via MindSnaps. Time Machine and MindSnaps development is dependent upon a Synthetic World foundation which includes an over-arching concept of operations for the employment of virtual worlds as part of the analytic infrastructure, along with the definition of prospective architectures for the use of synthetic worlds with legacy software and hardware infrastructure. 

Time Machine Thrust. 
Virtual worlds are in fact models that have several relevant properties: they can be shared by multiple people, they are persistent, and they evolve over time. We anticipate that a virtual world may be built based on data derived from the physical world, as well as including models, events and other factual data. In addition, the data may be updated as a model, it is possible to systematically explore temporal aspects of change of data and events that occur in the physical world. Forensic analysis can be performed by replicating the real world in a synthetic world. In this forensic mode, alternative explanations can be explored by adjusting assumptions and the quality index of the collected data and allowing the changes to propagate into the future. Proactive analysis could be explored by applying predictive models that look forward in time and suggest indicators leading to future events.

Virtual worlds are interesting as they allow the representation of complex, n-dimensional data sets; they can be shared by multiple people, and they evolve over time. In developing synthetic worlds to facilitate analysis, one of the more interesting aspects of synthetic worlds will be their ability to explore how data changes, and therefore the  implications of that change can be used in formulating hypotheses about, and explanations of, change. We believe a key dimension of exploring changing data will be the ability to manipulate time in the synthetic worlds – in effect turning these worlds into Time Machines. The use of synthetic worlds as Time Machines is conceptually about the explorations of data, and as such, may be (but need not be) tied to a physical location. These synthetic worlds will allow a variety of data abstractions to be embedded, layered, and compared. A critical issue in creating a Time Machine capability will be the ability to detect and manage significant changes from data. A-SpaceX will seek research and development for technologies that will address contextually relevant change detections and management from raw data streams. Further, the complexity of the data sets possible in synthetic worlds for analysis suggest that tools to optimize how those worlds work and appear for specific analytic problems will require the development of context “lens & filters” that will make it possible to highlight, distort or block different kinds of data within a synthetic world. 

The CONOP for Time Machines is expected to transform how analysts would explore data. For instance, analysts would begin their analytic work by selecting a “here and now”— where they pick a perspective of interest from which to explore the data sets represented within a synthetic world. The analysts would then assess possible futures relative to their chosen perspective in place and time.  This would become the basis for  effectively assessing the possibilities for a “then and there” relative to the “here and now” and developing potential hypotheses for what is possible in the future given what is known and unknown from the “here and now”. Another analytic CONOP might be that analysts would hypothesize a discrete (specific) future and then assess the viability of that hypothesis by exploring both known and unknown data represented in the synthetic world. In effect, the Time Machine CONOP would allow analysts to engage in forensic and proactive analysis, by viewing past/future perspectives.

MindSnaps Thrust. 
Current information technology is completely agnostic regarding helping an analyst to perform work. The burden is on the analyst to use tools to annotate, organize, and associate their work products. The analyst’s workflow process is complicated by methodology practices and security requirements of the IC that add even more tedious and time consuming activities. Today, there is no formal or proscribed mechanism for tracking analytic workflow. Current automation limitations make it extremely difficult for analysts to remember, find, and return to their analytic decision points to reconsider information changes, or try alternative hypotheses. None the less, analysts have to explain, share and propagate work products with supporting rationale to peers and managers. 

The analytic process is inherently iterative and fractionated. The analyst will typically think about one aspect of analytic problem until it is no longer fruitful, new data comes in, or a new facet of the problem becomes more salient. Analytic decision making is iterative because the analyst will often return to a previous point in his or her thinking and resume analysis from that point in time until a solution is found to the analytic problem. We believe that there is a theoretical and technological basis to monitor an analyst’s workflow, and detect when the analyst has shifted their “decision trajectory” while engaged in this iterative, fractionated process. Further, when a shift in decision trajectory is detected, the system would collect meta-data regarding the analyst’s workspace including what software applications were in use, where they were located and the data sets open in those applications. By examining the work that was being done before the decision trajectory shifted, it should be possible to extract meta-knowledge about what the analyst was doing during that period of analysis. The meta-knowledge would become the basis for creating a meaningful abstraction to summarize that decision trajectory. Together, the meta-data about the workspace and the meta-knowledge data would be combined to create a MindSnap. MindSnaps will be the basis for the creation of mental bookmarks of an analyst’s decision making. A-SpaceX seeks to develop a research thrust that explores creating a synthetic world that is based on MindSnaps and facilitates an analysts exploring the analytic process tied to a problem of interest.  This  "Decision Space" synthetic world effectively maps the overall decision-making processes of analysts as graphical decision nodes, and allows them to find and, cognitively re-load their workstation from different points in their own analytic process. 
Common to both the development of Time Machine and MindSnap capabilities will be the development of an overarching concept of operations (CONOP) and a shared Human–Computer Interface for the use of synthetic worlds as analytic tools. Further, the application of current virtual world technologies to support the proposed CONOP will require the adaptation of current virtual world technologies. The A-SpaceX program will likely, therefore, include a systems engineering task to address the common information technologies anticipated as being required for the use of synthetic worlds in support of the analytic tasks. During Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program, we anticipate that these tasks will be largely limited to the definition of coherent CONOP as well as architecting the requirements for supporting systems architectures. There may be limited development of those services and the definition of knowledge representation in support of the critical services identified as being required for the A-SpaceX CONOP. 

Summary. 
An A-SpaceX Phase 1 Industry Day was held on July 8, 2008 .  The purpose of  Industry Day was to provide the A-SpaceX vision and concepts / ideas that may appear in the BAA, and solicit feedback from potential performers on key ideas and technical challenges. Parties still interested in participating in the A-SpaceX program or commenting on the program described above are welcome to communicate with the A-SpaceX team prior to the publishing of a BAA by sending an e-mail to: DNI-IARPA-ASPACEX@UGOV.GOV. You will then be contacted to arrange a brief conference call with the A-SpaceX management team. Please be advised, the management team cannot discuss or evaluate specific research or proprietary technologies.  Conversations relating to the A-SpaceX vision, general research A-SpaceX interests, or potential technical / theoretical challenges and significant development milestones are encouraged. 

We cannot control the types of problems that future analysts might face. We cannot control the demands for understanding information and the pressure for faster decision making. We can, however, provide the analyst with an environment that encourages creativity, reasoning, collaboration with internal and external experts, rapid exploration of alternate perspectives for greater understanding, and detecting change in data and through processes within a multi-dimensional information rich synthetic world. Welcome to A-SpaceX where it’s about… the future.

This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and NO contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<DESC><p>MODIFICATION 01- HEREBY ISSUED TO CORRECT TITLE DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) located in Santa Barbara, CA on a sole source basis with University of California. The government intends to acquire supplies using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The proposed contract is for services to maintain a series of oceanographic instruments in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.  Maintenance of these instruments requires a contractor to conduct multiple research cruises in 2005 to download data from instruments placed in the sanctuary in 2004.  In addition to downloading data and maintaining the oceanographic instruments, the contractor shall provide data and reports of their findings to CINMS. Contractor SHALL perform the following tasks:<br />1)	Project Reports: Reports detailing activities conducted and preliminary results will be provided to the CINMS in fall 2006.  <br />2)	Data: Contractor shall provide data from SEA stations to a database accessible to CINMS.<br /> 3)  Conduct a graduate seminar in ocean observatory data analysis and visualization     <br /> at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  <br /> 4)   Produce with a comparative process among the participants in the graduate      <br /> seminar, a data analysis, visualization and communication product that displays  <br /> the data collected with the ADCP ocean observing instruments and which can be  <br /> exported to web-based platforms including, but not limited to SIMoN. <br /> 5)  Develop exportable visualization tools. ONMS, in coordination with other  <br />NOAA and NOS offices, has been deploying ocean observing assets for several years across the Pacific Coast of the United States.  To date, this activity has amounted to deploying environmental monitoring instrumentation. CINMS and ONMS now need to develop tools and products to analyze, display and communicate the results of this monitoring to sanctuary managers, NOAA administration and the public.  Communicating this information is complex as the monitoring data are of high dimensionality (X-Y location, time, depth, U&amp;V current direction and magnitude, etc.), and simple solutions are not at hand and require creative technical development.  Therefore, the xx component of this project is to conduct a graduate seminar with a framework to competitively develop a data analysis and visualization tool that can be exported in diverse web-based platforms including, but not limited to the Sanctuary Integrated Monitoring Network (SIMoN).<br />This project builds upon an array of oceanographic instruments placed around the Channel Islands to track the movement of water masses.  The existing array is operated by scientists with the University of California's Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), which has installed an oceanographic instrument array at the islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel, as well as additional arrays along the mainland coast.  As such, PISCO scientists and technicians are uniquely qualified to maintain the six CINMS stations, they have an existing database of information that CINMS data can augment, making the information from CINMS stations a part of a larger oceanographic picture.  <br />The government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract with period of performance of six months from date of award.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. Questions concerning this acquisition must be directed to Maria Mendoza by email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov.  This is a small purchase action estimated value of less than $100,000.00.  ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.  After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are also required to complete online Representations and Certifications at HTTP://ORCA.BPN.GOV.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on a sole source basis to participate in a consensus committee on the Global Health Security Initiative, conducted by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM).  This is not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The IOM will convene a consensus committee to examine the case why multiple elements of American society should invest in global health, what areas need the most attention, and how best to accomplish the ultimate objective.  The report will address the case for deeper commitment to global health and associated aspects of human development by Americans and communicate specific conclusions and recommendations that would pertain to not only the government in general and individuals of variable economic means, but also the public health and scientific research communities sector, the media, new and established foundations, a range of elements from the university community, and non-governmental organizations to include faith-based and international service organizations.  A final report will be prepared and distributed to the participating Federal agencies and leadership. 

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-5 entitled “Authorized or required by statute.” Executive Order 12832 authorizes procurement of services from NAS on a noncompetitive basis when a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that NAS, because of its unique qualifications, can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department’s or agency’s program requirements. 

Therefore, based on the aforementioned facts and the statutory authority at FAR 6.302-5, the Government intends on making a single non-competitive award to the NAS after July 31, 2008.
