The ASCO Annual Meeting brings together more than 25,000 oncology professionals from a broad range of specialties from North America as well as the rest of the world, making it an excellent venue for CTEP program staff overseeing NCI-supported clinical trials to meet and discuss the latest clinical research findings in cancer. The venue of meetings at ASCO allows an unparalleled opportunity for NCI staff to address key issues affecting NCI programs and to make decisions regarding strategy, prioritization of research questions, and study operations related to ongoing and future clinical trials in a timely manner, especially with respect to late breaking research presented at the annual meeting.</p>
<p>CTEP is required to use a meeting space that is selected and approved by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for its 2018 Annual Meeting. Space at the Hilton Chicago was selected and approved for ASCO.</p>
