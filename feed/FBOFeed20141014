<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Basic Ordering Agreement Contract N00019-14-C-0066 with Carleton Technologies Inc. (Cobham) on an &lsquo;other than full and open' competitive basis to address Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Recurring Engineering (RE) associated with the qualification and procurement of the newly designed man-mounted O2 Advanced Breathing Regulator (ABR-300) as an alternative to the current CRU-103 regulator. Due to hindrance issues related to the size/location of the CRU-103 regulator, as well as egress concerns, Carleton designed the ABR-300 based on the proven CRU-103 design. Carleton Technologies Inc. (Cobham) is the manufacturer and possesses the requisite knowledge and expertise required to qualify the ABR-300 for use on the V-22 Osprey. Additionally, based on shared parts from the proven CRU-103 design, some qualification by similarity may be possible. Carleton Technologies Inc. (Cobham) has already completed the drawings/prototyping process and has manufactured four prototype ABR-300s. Carleton Technologies Inc. (Cobham) is the sole source required in order to incorporate the mentioned changes in order to utilize the regulators in a timely manner without duplication of development which has already been established.

<DESC><p>USAID/CAR Regional Mission intends to issue a solicitation to qualified offerors for the HIV Regional Flagship Activity to be implemented in Central Asian Region.</p>
<p>The purpose of this HIV Regional Flagship Activity is to increase use of evidence-based government- and NGO-provided HIV prevention, treatment and care services by people living with HIV and key populations: people who inject drugs, prisoners, sex workers and men who have sex with men. By providing targeted technical assistance to the government and NGO sector to reach the populations driving the HIV epidemic, this Activity will ultimately contribute to reducing the number of new HIV infections and reducing HIV-related deaths in Central Asia.</p>
<p>The purpose will be achieved through three intermediate results (IR), supported by five sub-intermediate results (Sub IR), drawn from USAID/CAR's Regional Development Coordination Strategy. Under this HIV Regional Flagship Activity, the Sub IRs from RDCS will be referred to as Results.</p>
<p>Result 1: Increased access to HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for key populations (Sub IR 3.3.1)<br />Result 2: Improved quality of HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for key populations Sub IR 3.3.2<br />Result 3: Stronger, more representative civil society (Sub IR 3.1.1)<br />Result 4: More robust mechanisms for social partnerships with CSOs in policy reform and service delivery (Sub IR 3.1.2)<br />Result 5: Improved capacity of key state bodies to govern well (Sub IR 3.2.1)</p>
<p>This procurement will support a core range of activities which support accomplishment of each sub-IR. Under the core budget scenario, activities will take place in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. In the event that additional funding becomes available, core activities could begin in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and activities within the contract's core Scope of Work may be scaled up or intensified to support achievement of the contract objectives. Under each objective, activities falling under the core set of objectives are referred to as core activities, while additional activities that may be purchased to increase impact are referred to as supplementary activities.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1. SUBJECT:</strong> The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research to identify vascular shunts, specifically indicated for treatment of distal vascular injuries, which can be applied in field or aeromedical evacuation (AE) conditions. Solutions should include commercially available devices, as well as prototypes that are expected to become commercially available. Responses are due to this request for information (RFI) by <span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase; COLOR: blue">1:00pm cst</span> on <span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase; COLOR: blue">14 November 2014</span>.<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"></em></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">3. BACKGROUND:</strong> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Military combat operations have resulted in a high incidence of extremity injuries which can be associated with a high incidence of amputation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to improve the salvage rate of injured limbs, forward surgical teams need an improved capability to utilize vascular shunts in field conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ability for a trained physician of any specialty to apply a vascular shunt in the field would be a marked improvement from current capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Therefore, the Air Force Medical Support Agency, Requirements Division (AFMSA/SG5O) is requesting information regarding extremity vascular shunt that can be easily and quickly applied to wounded vasculature in a trauma situation.</p>

<DESC>AEDC is seeking an organization with the multidisciplinary engineering&nbsp;ability to develop a domain connectivity software application that will be utilized in a high fidelity, physics-based, multi-flow solver paradigm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (DoD HPCMP)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is currently developing a Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) tool for aircraft design and analysis. The resulting program is called the Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments for Air Vehicles (CREATE-AV). Two of the three physics-based simulation software products being developed as part of the program are Kestrel and Helios. Kestrel delivers virtual design test and analysis capabilities for fixed-wing aircraft (full spectrum - fighter, bomber, tanker, reconnaissance, etc), while Helios provides that same capabilities for rotary-wing aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CREATE-AV Helios and Kestrel software<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>products utilize a "dual mesh" paradigm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, this is use of either a "strand" grid or "unstructured" grid near to a surface geometry (of an aircraft) to resolve boundary effects, and a high-order Cartesian system of grids away from the body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The desired organization must have the ability to develop the grid assembly software application that will enable efficient interpolation between the strand (unstructured) grid and the far-field (Cartesian) grid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This dual mesh combination present a novel and very powerful paradigm that none of the other commonly used domain connectivity tools is currently exploiting. Exploitation of these attributes is the critical path to development of both Kestrel and Helios.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The capability captured by this unique paradigm enables true automation of domain connectivity, is highly scalable, and enables efficient memory use.

<DESC>&nbsp; This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain capability statements, regarding: <br /><br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br /><br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br /><br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition (339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supply Manufacturing). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code (339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supply Manufacturing) should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br /> This Sources Sought Notice has been posted to establish, provide, and maintain a laboratory animal personnel protective equipment (PPE) resource to ensure the accessibility and availability of essential supplies throughout an emergency/disaster, government shutdown, or any other interruption of regular deliveries.  These supplies support irreplaceable multidisciplinary animal research, which is critical to the mission of eight institutes at the National Institutes of Health.  This requirement for supplies of a specific quality and quantity meets specific specifications.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The Contract will consist of a base year with four (4) option years. In addition to establishing and maintaining PPE as an emergency and disaster resource, the vendor must provide high quality laboratory PPE that meet the specifications as outlined below. Since PPE products have a definitive shelf life, to maintain the integrity of the stocked items the vendor shall deliver requested items from the reserve to the facility on a routine basis or upon request as outlined below. In addition, the vendor shall reestablish the reserve as directed by the Government on a monthly basis. It is the vendor's responsibility to manage the reserve to ensure the continued rotation of product to protect the integrity of the resource.</p>
<p>Project requirements:</p>
<p>Therefore, the vendor must be able to supply the following goods or services:</p>
<p>1.	Provide PPE products identical or equivalent to Life Science SMS Lab Coats, Polypropylene Coveralls, SMS Coveralls, Suntech Microporous Film Coveralls, the Non-Skid/Water Resistant shoe covers, Guardian Nitrile Gloves, and Rhino Shield Latex Medical Grade Gloves.  PPE items may be added, subtracted, or otherwise modified at the discretion of the Government to meet evolving program requirements;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.	Ensure that the lab coats and coveralls meet the sizing specifications, salient characteristics and physical properties as outline below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.	Ensure that the gloves meet the salient characteristic as outline below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.	Provide a specialized temperature, humidity, and vermin controlled storage/warehouse, as outlined below;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.	Provide routine deliveries to our research facility. Deliveries will be made Monday through Friday from 7:30 AM to 3:00 PM (excluding Federal Holidays);</p>
<p>6.	Provide emergency deliveries and services in the event of an emergency or disaster;</p>
<p>7.	Ensure that the integrity of the products is maintained throughout storage and delivery. This includes, but is not limited to, protection from moisture and dust which may carry unwanted pathogens;</p>
<p>8.	Ensure that less than five percent (&lt;5%) of boxes/items are torn, ripped, or damaged upon delivery; to include faulty zippers within the coveralls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.	Provide a credit/replacement, at the contractor's expense, for all broken, torn, ripped, or damaged PPE items;</p>
<p>10.	Provide return trips to correct an incorrect product delivery/order or replace damaged items within 24 hours of the original required delivery date and time;&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.	Unload pallets from the delivery truck and place them on the designated animal facility loading dock;</p>
<p>12.	Maintain current and accurate product inventory details and controls to ensure the rotation of stock, timely dating, and delivery;</p>
<p>13.	Supply a copy of the current inventory, including inventory numbers of each product by manufacturer and production dates, to the COTR on a monthly basis, at the end of each month, or upon request;</p>
<p>14.	Provide an Operations Statement which includes the vendors program for maintaining the integrity of the stored and delivered products, as well as product rotation and inventory programs; and</p>
<p>15.	Provide a Disaster Plan to include how the contractor shall ensure the provision of services and transportation of required supplies in the event of an emergency or disaster.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:</p>
<p>To Be Determined</p>
<br />
<p>Other important considerations:</p>
<p><br /> 1. Coupled with the potential for prolonged manufacturing times and a definitive product shelf life, underscores the critical need for this contract. It is the goal of this contract to establish a stable, cost effective, mechanism to ensure the immediate accessibility of up to a ninety (90) day supply of material, as well as provide for the availability of material for rotation and replacement throughout the twelve (12) month contract period. The initial emergency/disaster reserve volume of all PPE will be determined at the time of award. The reserve volume for each category and product will be subsequently adjusted on a monthly basis in accordance with available resources and program requirements.</p>
<p>2. The Building 49 Central Animal Facility (CAF) located on the Bethesda campus of the National Institutes of Health contributes to the advancement of biomedical research by providing professional and technical support services related to laboratory animal care and use, and housing laboratory animals in support of eight institute's intramural research program. In order to support our animals and the critical research programs they represent, we must ensure consistent supply PPE materials, even during emergency and disaster situations. Due to the critical nature of these supplies our program requirements have been incorporated into both our Facility and Institute disaster preparedness plans.</p>
<p>3. The value of disaster preparedness to laboratory animal facilities has been highlighted in recent years, because of several large scale disasters that have impacted the U.S. research investment.  Disaster preparedness in the workplace seeks to reduce direct and indirect losses resulting from disasters. Losses are smallest when the disruptions to animal care and research are minimized. During emergency/disaster events, the normal supply and distribution channels will most likely be unavailable/or protracted due to the impact of the emergency and the rush of immediate orders.  Our program's disaster plan takes these factors into account; it is therefore our intention is to establish an offsite source of critical supplies with an established, laboratory animal PPE vendor with a proven track record of providing quality products and services. As outlined in our emergency plan it is the intention of our program to be able to house up to a one year's supply of PPE products with a local vendor within a 90 mile radius of NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. The ideal vendor will need a strong disaster plan and have arrangements made with the state and federal agencies in the event of an emergency and or disaster to be able to arranged deliveries to the NIH. As a secondary backup, in the event that the vendor is not able to transport the required supplies we will work with the local vendor to directly pick up the required items.</p>
<p>4. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition) defines animal biosecurity as "all measures taken to identify, contain, prevent and eradicate known or unknown infections that may cause clinical disease or alter physiologic and behavioral responses or otherwise make the animals unsuitable for research". The National Animal Health Emergency Management System Guidelines define biosecurity for animal production facilities similarly as "a series of management practices designed to prevent the introduction of and spread of disease agents." Therefore, as part of our program's "Biosecurity Program" we must ensure the provision of an uninterrupted supply of essential supplies, this plan is a shared responsibility between our program and the selected vendor to ensure the consistent availability of high quality PPE products and services.</p>
<p>5. The Vendor's warehouse is required to have adequate, vermin free, space available for the storage of up to a year's supply of PPE. The supplies will be stored in an area that is protected from the risk of contamination from animal pathogens, toxic and or hazardous substances. Ideally, the product shall also be protected from dust which may carry or harbor pathogens. The warehouse shall have a pest control program designed to prevent, control or eliminate the presence of or infestation by pests. The Vendor must provide the name of the firm that provides vermin and pest control services as well as a description of their pest control program. A regularly scheduled and documented program of control and monitoring should exist. The Vendor also must provide documentation with regard to their quality assurance practices. All products supplied should be free of chemical or pathologic contaminants and the presence of natural toxicants.  Areas used for storage should not be subject to elevated temperatures or elevated relative humidity for prolonged periods of time as outlined below. The Vendor must provide information on manufacturing, monitoring, and storage of PPE products, as well as quality assurance results on a monthly basis.  As part of our programs' responsibility, we will inspect the site(s) annually to ensure that they are meeting the above requirements.</p>
<p>6. It is our intent to incorporate within the contract the ability to secure space within the suppliers' warehouse(s) that meets the biosecurity requirements listed above. As part of the agreement, we would meet with the vendor prior to award and once a year thereafter for a site visit of the warehouse to ensure that the stated requirements outlined in this statement of work are met or exceeded. This will ensure that the facility is able to maintain up to a year's reserve of PPE products at the respective location, as well as the vendor's ability to meet or exceed the requirement of this SOW. This vendor would be required to provide a detailed inventory list on a monthly basis, or more often if needed, and document that the reserve stock is being rotated to ensure the integrity of all products.</p>
<p>7. All PPE clothing and equipment should be of safe design and construction, and should be maintained in a clean and reliable fashion. The Government has taken the usability and fit of the proposed PPE into consideration with the specifications outlined in this RFP.  The specifications are based on the requirements that the PPE fits well and is comfortable to wear.  This encourages both our staff and researchers to use the PPE. The PPE specifications are available in multiple sizes and care should be taken to ensure that they meet the specifications so that the proper size for each employee is met. It is not uncommon for several different types of PPE to be worn together; the specifications found within the RFP ensure the compatibility of the different PPE. If PPE does not fit properly, it can make the difference between being safely covered or dangerously exposed. Ill-fitting PPE will fail to provide the required level of protection for the staff and the animals, as well as discouraging appropriate use.</p>
<p>8. The distinction between exam gloves proposed within the RFP and general purpose gloves needs to be clarified.  Exam grade gloves are different from general purpose gloves in that they must meet a series of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in order to be marketed as exam grade gloves and are acceptable for use by doctors, dentists, labs or any other application requiring a specific barrier to blood or infectious agents. Exam gloves are regulated by stringent FDA requirements requiring specific production and quality control standards. General purpose gloves are for use in food service, industrial or any other application that does not require a specific barrier to blood or infectious agents. This is the most common glove found in the marketplace and popular uses include food service, packaging, automotive, painting and health &amp; beauty. For this RFP only Medical-Grade gloves will be used and must meet the FDA Acceptable Quality level. This is a quality specification that manufacturers, as well as the FDA use to specify the pinhole rate in medical examination gloves.  FDA standards specify an AQL of 2.5 for the medical examination gloves.  This means that the defect level from a large number of gloves will not exceed 2.5%.  The tensile strength of a glove is the measurement of the amount of force or pull required to break any glove.  The length and thickness (Mil) is defined within the salient characteristic of each glove listed in the RFP.</p>
<p>9. Samples of each item will be specifically requested as part of any future proposal.  Samples are to be furnished free of charge.  Samples can be returned at an prospective vendor's request, provided that the vendor pay for the transportation costs.</p>
<p>Standards:<br />&bull;	National Research Council (2011). Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition. Pages 21, 22, 141. Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences</p>
<p><br />&bull;	National Institute of Health, Animal Research Advisory Committee Guidelines for Personnel Protection in Animal Facilities</p>
<p><br />&bull;	OSHA requires that many categories of PPE meet or be equivalent to standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The proposed PPE must meet the cited ANSI standard. PPE stocks must meet the ANSI standard in effect at the time of its manufacture or provide protection equivalent to PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria. OSHA requires PPE to meet the following ANSI standards:</p>
<p>o	Eye and Face Protection: ANSI Z87.1-1989 (USA Standard for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection).<br />o	Head Protection: ANSI Z89.1-1986.<br />o	Foot Protection: ANSI Z41.1-1991.<br />o	For hand protection, there is no ANSI standard for gloves but OSHA recommends that selection be based upon the tasks to be performed and the performance and construction characteristics of the glove material. For protection against chemicals, glove selection must be based on the chemicals encountered, the chemical resistance and the physical properties of the glove material.</p>

<p>Classification Code: R - Professional, Administrative and Management Support with the NAICS of 517919, size standard of $32.5M.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA) is to announce the Government's intention to pursue a sole source extension for a period of up to six (6) months for the MILSATCOM Orbital Operations &amp; Logis8808-tics Sustainment Support (MOO&amp;LSS) requirement. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to further evaluate capability briefs, release a competitive solicitation, or award a contract. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201, a sources sought synopsis was originally posted to FedBizOpps (FBO) on 30 Jun 08. The synopsis described the intent of the Government to combine efforts associated with Milstar/DSCS III Orbital Operations Support and MILSATCOM Logistics Sustainment Support. Interested parties were provided an opportunity to submit an unclassified Statement of Capabilities (SOC) demonstrating detailed design knowledge of Milstar and DSCS III satellites and ground systems including hardware design, test procedures, individual spacecraft configurations and orbital procedures. The SOCs were necessary to complete the market research and determine whether or not other potential sources were available to provide the required services. The Government did consider breaking out portions of the requirement where competition might be possible. The analysis, however, eventually concluded that a breakout was not a feasible approach, no significant benefits would be gained, and any derived benefits would not offset the potential duplication of costs by having two contractors perform the requirement. Furthermore, given the Government's limited ownership of technical and software data on the Milstar system, it was determined the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, was the only vendor capable of providing the highly specialized services and skill-sets to sustain an aging operational constellation.</p>
<p>Based upon the results of the market research conducted and the aforementioned Government analysis, the Government awarded a contract for these services on a sole source basis to LMSSC on 1 Dec 09 and with performance scheduled to complete on 30 Nov 14. It was anticipated the MOO&amp;LSS services would be combined later with the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) on-orbit and sustainment requirements upon an AEHF Initial Operating Capability declaration by HQ Air Force Space Command. The new Combined Orbital Operations and Logistics Support (COOLS) contract award, however, has been delayed and it is now critical that the current MOO&amp;LSS services continue uninterrupted. An extension for a period not to exceed six (6) months will be awarded under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency's Requirements. While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties including small and small disadvantaged businesses may identify their interest and technical capability to the prospective source identified below:</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin Corporation<br />Space Systems Company<br />1111 Lockheed Martin Way<br />Sunnyvale, CA 94089<br />Maria Hartin-Swart<br />408-742-1665</p>
<p>Description of Services:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Division contracting branch (SMC/PKJ) located at Peterson AFB, CO is contemplating acquisition and award of a contract extension for sustaining support of MILSATCOM Orbital Operations &amp; Logistics Sustainment Support (MOO&amp;LSS). The current primary places of contract performance are Los Angeles, CA; Vandenberg AFB, CA; Sunnyvale, CA; Colorado Springs, CO; Peterson AFB, CO; Schriever AFB, CO; Camp Parks Communications Annex, CA; Wideband SATCOM Operation Centers; all mobile deployed locations; and OCONUS.</p>
<p>The Government requires sustaining engineering and logistics support for Milstar (extremely/ultra high frequencies - EHF/UHF; low and medium data rates - LDR/MDR) and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) III (super high frequency - SHF/X-Band and high data rate). The MOO&amp;LSS effort includes satellite payload and bus sustainment, engineering and analysis; ground, satellite and payload command and control (C2) system engineering; systems integration and test; configuration management and status accounting; security engineering; help-desk and on-site technical advisors support (as required) and specialty engineering. These support functions are critical to maintaining continued day-to-day satellite/constellation operations, to resolving system-impacting anomalies when they occur and to maintaining and extending the service life of these multi-billion dollar space systems. Supporting the sustainment of the DSCS III and Milstar systems requires detailed knowledge of DSCS III and Milstar satellite bus and payload designs and operations, including functional interfaces and terminal interoperability.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the extension is for up to six months. The projected award date for this effort is in the final calendar quarter of 2014. The anticipated contract type is Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF).</p>
<p>This notice expires 15 days after publication.</p>

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of The Department of Defense (DOD) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties of an interest in establishing a Section 845 Other Transaction (OTA) agreement with an eligible entity or group of entities to develop and mature technologies and support policy development to enable advanced approaches to electromagnetic spectrum use. This initiative will support possible needs across the government and industry, in alignment with the National Information Technology R&D (NITRD)/Wireless Spectrum R&D (WSRD) Senior Steering Group (SSG) mission to promote collaboration among government, industry and academia.   The purpose of this effort is to identify areas of Research & Development/Prototyping (R&D/PROTOTYPING) of vital importance to the Department's ability to maintain access to the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).  The Government is seeking to facilitate optimal application of SRF funds in developing technologies that enable both spectrum sharing and more efficient spectrum use.   <br>  <br> Section 845(a) (2) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, as amended (Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 2371 note), authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems. The Government must ensure that, when an agency enters into an Other Transaction Agreement for a prototype project under this authority, nontraditional defense contractor(s) participate to a significant extent in the prototype project; or at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Government.  <br>  <br> Currently, the Government and industry share a common challenge of satisfying vastly increasing demand for the use of electromagnetic spectrum(s). Multiple efforts are addressing this fundamental issue as it hampers U.S. innovation and economic growth and hinders U.S. military operations both domestically and overseas.  <br>  <br> The envisioned collaboration between the Government and Industry focuses on (but is not limited to) the following Science and Technology areas for consideration:  <br>  <br> 1.	Investments in Radar-Commercial communications sharing technologies, targeted initially to the 3.5 GHz and 5 GHz bands.  Rationale:  the Department is currently in discussions with both Industry and federal regulators to explore options for sharing portions of these bands with commercial wireless providers.  There is also international interest in sharing these regions of the EMS.  Investments in these technologies will enable the Department to maintain mission effectiveness and operational readiness while supporting our own, and the Nation's, strategic goal of spectrum sharing. <br>  <br> 2.	Investment in use of Millimeter Wave (MMW) and Free-Space Optical (FSO) technologies for terrestrial and air-ground communications and C2/telemetry applications.  Rationale:  the Department's use of spectrum below 6 GHz for terrestrial and air-ground communications is vital to mission effectiveness; demand for these services is increasing and geographical availability of these spectral regions is static or declining, making sharing with commercial service providers difficult.  This problem is compounded in the case of air-ground communications and C2, where large exclusion zones have been encountered in the AWS-3 auction proceedings due to the nature of the airborne applications.   Investments in MMW and FSO technologies will enable the Department to strategically explore these spectral regions and transition terrestrial and air-ground services into these less congested areas.  <br>  <br> 3.	Development and deployment of the Air/Maritime Training Instrumentation (AMTI) waveform.  Rationale:  The AWS-3 auction proceedings enables commercial access to the lower portion (1755-1780 MHz) while DoD will have access to the upper portion (1780-1850 MHz) indefinitely.  Though this provides commercial access to only a small amount of spectrum, the economic and political situation at the time made this an acceptable solution.  Underlying this solution is the general understanding that industry will be seeking access to the upper portion in the near future.  One of the concepts that has been investigated is modifying the ACTS system to use a much more efficient waveform, the AMTI; using the AMTI will better position the Department to open up additional spectrum access, on a shared basis, with commercial service providers.  <br>  <br> 4.	Investments in Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Frequency Reuse (FR) technologies for communications and radar systems.  Rationale:  As sharing becomes more prevalent, systems will need to adjust dynamically to their current electromagnetic environment (EME) automatically and considering their geospatial and temporal location.  Investments in this area will enable the Department to consider more dynamic sharing scenarios and mechanism and improve reliability and mission effectiveness in spectrally-constrained environments.  <br>  <br> 5.	Investments in algorithms and approaches for improving spectrum situational awareness (SA), spectrum command & control (C2), and management of the electromagnetic environment.  Rationale:  As the Department moves towards sharing, with itself and with commercial service providers, while maintaining our ability to project power globally, it will be vital to improve our ability to maintain positive control of the spectrum resource and solid situation awareness of the spectrum  quote mark terrain quote mark , both from a friendly force and enemy force perspective.  This investment will develop technologies and techniques that can be deployed into land, air, sea, and cyber domain capabilities to achieve spectrum SA and C2 under the auspices of the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) doctrine. <br>  <br> 6.	Investments in improvements for modeling and simulation of the Electromagnetic Environment (EME).  Rationale:  Emerging results from the DoD EMS Strategy Roadmap and Near-Term Action plan indicate that the Department must improve our ability to model and simulate the EME, to include assessing sharing approaches and techniques, and addressing attending interference and propagation effects.   <br>  <br> 7.	Investments in Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) and other communication and radar waveform efficiency technologies.  Rationale:  As more regions of the spectrum become open to sharing, the Department will need to be more efficient with our available spectrum access.   Investments now in basic and applied R&D/PROTOTYPING will yield useable technologies for programs in a few years at a time when spectrum sharing will be implemented on a wide scale. <br>  <br> 8.	Interference tolerance and hardening technologies for communications and radar system.  Rationale:  As the department transforms to a share-first model, it will become increasing important for new communications and radar systems to be tolerant of interference that characterizes sharing environments.  Department R&D/PROTOTYPING investments now will create technologies mature enough to be implemented in programs later when spectrum sharing becomes more widespread, both nationally and internationally. <br>  <br> 9.	Investments in adaptive RF technologies.  Rationale:  In Quadrennial Defense Review 2014, the Department recognized that the EMS, along with international waters and airspace and the cyber domain were vital to the Military's ability to project the force internationally.  As spectrum sharing increases both domestically and internationally, the Department will face additional barriers to spectrum access as it deploys into regions of the globe that either do not support sharing arrangements in particular bands or deny use of those bands.  It is prudent for the Department to invest in technologies now that will enable communications and radar systems to be able to change the spectrum regions in which they operate in response to either enemy action or the exercise of nation-state sovereign rights. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that industry members may propose forming a consortium that would seek to work with the Government through an OTA in this area. DOD and NITRD/WSRD recognize that both Government and industry can benefit from an OTA  with a consortium, in order to achieve more rapid contracting, acceleration of discovery, unparalleled ability to tailor research, policy consideration concurrent with technological advances, a more focused and synergistic research agenda, and relief from excessive  requirements.  Any company, university, or research organization is eligible to join the consortium.  The Government is seeking interested parties that are willing to join and/or establish a consortium with collective expertise in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS). <br>  <br> The Government anticipates responses from this announcement from interested parties, with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for research and development efforts to support the NITRD/WSRD.  Responses can be sent to Ms. Kristen Kachur, Contract Specialist, via email at kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Responses should contain the interested parties' experience and capability information.  In addition, if any existing consortium wishes to respond as an entity, the response shall include consortium name, vision, mission statement, goals, membership (indicating traditional and nontraditional defense contractors), success criteria, metrics, management framework, articles of collaboration/by-laws, Consortium Member Agreement (CMA), accounting practices, fee structure, and other information which the respondent considers of assistance in developing successful Government/academia/industrial partnerships. In addition, the interested parties shall provide specific experience in technology areas listed in this notice along with a description of their capabilities for the categories under which they have experience. <br>  <br> Electronic responses are to be in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format using a size 12 font with one inch margins.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to extend an existing contract on a sole source basis to ATAMIR-WSMR LLC, 1300 Britt St SE, Albuquerque, NM 87123-3353, for the Test Engineering and Analysis Services (TEAS) contract at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. The proposed contract action will add a six-month option period to Contract W9124Q-08-C-0547 under the provisions of statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The estimated dollar value of this action is approximately $9.5M for the period of performance of 1 December 2014 through 31 May 2015.  <br>  <br> The Government's intent is to extend the current services with ATAMIR-WSMR in order to continue performance of the required services until the fully competitive follow-on contract can be solicited, negotiated, and awarded. Award to any other source at this time would negatively impact WSMR's ability to perform its mission. It would be impossible for any other contractor to perform all of the highly specialized services required for the TEAS functions without causing an unacceptable delay in the performance of the mission and incurring an additional cost burden. <br>  <br> Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to: cynthia.m.uribe.civ@mail.mil, no later than 28 October 2014 at 4PM MDT. Comments submitted for consideration of other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 192 MSG/MSC VaANG Base Contracting Office <br> II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED <br> The contractual action is a Firm Fixed Price Contract for the acquisition of customer service functions: Customer Services to include CAC Card Services, DEERS, and RAPIDS on Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends. <br> III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS <br> Under the contemplated contract, HYPERION BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC., will provide the following supplies and services in sustainment of the VaANG: Customer Services to include CAC Card Services, DEERS, and RAPIDS on Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends for a period of time not to exceed 12 months. <br> IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1. <br> V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br> Request to award this requirement to only one responsible source. The requirement is a follow-on contract for the same services currently offered during the work week on Joint Base Langley Eustis throughout the week. Recommend sole source negotiation with recently awarded contractor to be employed at JBLE for these services under contract # FA4890-13-C-0108, Contractor: HYPERION BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC. This vendor has been provided all Government furnished facilities, property and equipment necessary to run the program for JBLE. The Government currently has no way to perform this function outside of contract. Award to any other source in the interim would result in substantial duplication of cost since all of the equipment required to complete the work associated with the contract is already installed and being operated and maintained by HYPERION BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC. The duplication of cost is not expected to be recovered through competition. In fact, if a different contractor is awarded a separate contract effort through the VaANG, there will be additional costs incurred for the VaANG to allow their contractor to change over custody of all equipment/supplies every Friday and Monday before and after the UTA. This would also require the ACC-AMIC contractor to work additional hours which may not be in the Air Force budget or which Air Force is not willing to allow, even if reimbursed. <br> VI.

A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  <br> The New Orleans District, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) - Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br> This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.   <br> USACE requires immediate response to contaminated water and possibly contaminated soil within the cofferdam at the 17th Street Canal Permanent Canal Closures and Pump Stations project location:  6800 Bellaire Dr. New Orleans, LA 70124.  Here is the project website: http://pccpconstructors-com.webs.com.  There are also other hazardous materials at the London Avenue and 17th Street project locations that must be properly handled and disposed of to complete construction.  <br> Response to the contaminated water may include, but is not limited to, treatment, removal and disposal at a permitted facility, or removal and treatment at a water treatment facility.  Response to soil contamination and other non-water hazardous substances could include sampling, lab analysis and disposal at a permitted facility. Handling of hazardous substances must be in compliance with Federal, State, and/or local hazardous waste handling and disposal regulations. This potentially includes actual disposal of hazardous wastes generated by others.  The Contractor shall perform limited contaminated soil excavation and disposal as it relates to containerized HTRW work or other small areas that have contaminated soils due to historic conditions.  Corps of Engineers EM 1110-1 502, ENGINEERING AND DESIGN - TECHNICAL GUIDELINES FOR HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE TREATMENT AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES dated 30 April 1994 will provide guidance for these activities. The Contractor shall also remove, decontaminate and dispose of any related debris that is associated with soil excavations and project demolitions.   <br> All hazardous substances shall be removed and/or treated from the project site no later than 30 Nov 2014.    <br> This service will be delivered to the New Orleans District, USACE. FSC Code is S222, NAICS Code is 562211, and Size standard is $38.5 Million. <br> PCCP Constructors JV is the only eligible company that can deliver the desired service without resulting in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Furthermore, the removal of the hazardous substances is time sensitive in nature.  Utilization of a different contractor would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.  In addition, coordination with multiple contractors within a congested construction site  makes use of another contractor extremely high risk. <br> Parties may express their interest; accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 29 October 2014 by 4:00pm Central.  Responses should be sent to timothy.black@usace.army.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement; therefore, the initial submission must include adequate information for the Contracting Officer to determine whether the contractor is capable of providing the required services.  Additional information will not be requested. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. <br> This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> US Army Engineer District, New Orleans, Attn: Contracting Officer  <br> P.O.

<DESC>This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL) to buy brand name software licenses without competition as prescribed in FAR 6.302-1. Specifically, the government will purchase the following items manufactured by The Nonin from the manufacturer or one of its distributors: <br>  <br> 1.	Ten (10) boxes of 8004CA SenSmart EQUANOX Advance Adult/Pediatric 4-Wavelength rSO2 Sensor <br>  <br> The requested items are 10 boxes of sensors, with each box containing 20 sensors, for a total of 200 sensors that are needed for human subject research addressing the effects of aviation-related hypoxia on the levels of oxygen in the brain. Each measurement requires 2 sensors so that the 200 sensors will support 100 measurements. These sensors are not reusable. The sensors stick to the forehead of the human research volunteer and provide a light that illuminates the brain through the skin and intervening tissue and then measures the light reflected back out of the brain through the tissue. The specific characteristic of the light are such that the amount of reflected light indicates the amount of oxygen in the brain tissue.  <br>  <br> The specific sensors requested, the 8004CA SenSmart Advance Adult/Pediatric 4-Wavelength rSO2 Sensor (Part Number 8974-001 - Box of 20), are available only from the manufacturer, Nonin Medical, Inc. These specific sensors are requested since they are the only sensors that are compatible with the specific equipment that makes these measurements, the Model 7600 4-channel Regional Oximeter system and the 7600PA oximetry pod. There are no other sensors from any other source that can be used to make these measurements. <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 339112 and the size standard is 500 and FSC 6640. <br>  <br> This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102(a)(6) and 5.203(a).

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD CONTRACT TO MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE A MOTOROLA SYSTEM UPGRADE AGREEMENT(SUA II) FOR THE EXISTING RESCUE 21 ALASKA&nbsp;MCC 7500&nbsp;DISPATCH CONSOLE SYSTEM.
<p><br />The United States Coast Guard announces its intent to enter into a contract on a sole-source basis with Motorola Solutions, Inc. under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The anticipated period of performance will be a two year base period with eight (8) twelve (12) month option periods.</p>
<p>The anticipated award to Motorola Solutions, Inc. is to procure a Motorola System Upgrade Agreement (SUA II) which constitutes an estimated 10-year subscription service to provide complete system version upgrades and other hardware/software tech refresh to the existing Rescue 21 Alaska MCC 7500 Dispatch Console System. The SUA is a complete package of hardware, software, and implementation services required to update the Coast Guard's existing MCC 7500/ASTRO25 system to future system releases. Motorola MCC7500 system release software is proprietary in nature and Motorola maintains a lab at their Schaumburg, IL facility to test and vet both hardware and software upgrades to ensure complete system functionality once updates are delivered. The Coast Guard's MCC 7500 system requires utilization of fully vetted components and software updates to ensure 100 percent interoperability and functionality of the system. Future system upgrades are necessary to support essential search and rescue radio communications throughout the state of Alaska.</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard is aware of no organization, other than Motorola Solutions, Inc. that can provide the proprietary service (hardware and software) upgrades for the Rescue 21 Alaska Motorola MCC 7500/Astro 25 Dispatch Console System described above. However, any organization (other than Motorola) who believes that it is capable of providing an equivalent service for this specific console system shall e-mail a capability statement to Kristina.A.Morris@uscg.mil and Mari.K.Meiners@uscg.mil no later than 4:00 PM EST November 4, 2014.</p>
<p>Respondents are advised that the United States (U.S) Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this notice. All costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for proposals or quotations. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [XX], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [xx], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?
      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 
      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>

    (2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of equipment.

  (c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision-
    (1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and

  (d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

Each visit to PBA shall be for a 2 hour period from 9:00AM to 11:00AM local time on each date specified in the resultant BPA.   <br>      <br>   Emergency services may be required within 48 hours of request.   <br>      <br>   EVALUATION FOR AWARD:   <br>      <br>   In accordance with FAR 12.602, streamlined evaluation procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  Award will be made to the offeror who provides the lowest total evaluated price, who is deemed responsible, and who is compliant with all the requirements of this solicitation, to include submission requirements listed under  quote mark Quote Submission Requirements quote mark  below.  Award will be made on a Firm Fixed Price basis.  Price evaluation is as follows:   <br>      <br>   1. The offeror will enter unit prices for all shoe styles for the base year and each evaluated option year on the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet's first tab titled Summary of Unit Prices.  All unit prices shall be binding.   <br>      <br>   2. The Government reserves the right to require submission of any data necessary to validate the reasonableness of an offer.   <br>      <br>   3. Based on procurement history, the majority of purchases have been for the 8 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix.  The Government will evaluate offers based on unit prices proposed for these 8 shoe styles on the base year and each evaluated option year.  If an offeror fails to propose all of the unit prices for the base and evaluated option years, the Government may reject that offer as unacceptable.   <br>      <br>   4. For each proposal, the Government will calculate a weighted evaluated price by multiplying the proposed unit prices for the 8 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix, by their respected weights, and summing their totals.  The weight associated with each unit price, represents the likelihood among the most 8 prevalent shoe styles purchased, that an order, if placed, would be placed for that shoe style at the quoted unit price.   <br>      <br>   5. A Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the weighted evaluated prices for the 8 shoe styles found on the second tab of the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet titled Pricing Matrix for the base year and each evaluated option year.   <br>      <br>   6. Price Analysis shall be used to determine price reasonableness.  Additional analysis techniques may be used as determined necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REVISED SYNOPSIS, AS OF 14 OCTOBER 2014:</p>
<p>This request is issued on an unrestricted basis. This is not a solicitation or request for proposal; this synopsis is for the purpose of soliciting SF 330's from Architect-Engineer firms in order to select the most highly rated firms for the purpose of possible discussions. There is no specific design effort being solicited. This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and four option periods of one year each. The NAICS Code is 541330. The resultant solicitation and award will be accomplished in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in the procedures of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 36.6. A-E services are required for development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various/potential projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.</p>
<p>A. Type of Work: North Carolina Registered Professional A-E services with the required disciplines of architectural, structural, civil, environmental, electrical, fire protection, and mechanical. Field surveying, geotechnical, landscaping design and architectural rendering capabilities must be identified. Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm. A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. The selected A-E firm will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project that will result in a task order. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $4,900,000.00 with the maximum task order amount of $500,000.00. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $2,000.00 for the life of the contract. The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, plumbing, electrical, fire protection, site work, and mechanical requirements. Field surveying, geotechnical investigation, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required. Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required. The firm must also be able to provide on-site engineering to perform complete/partial designs, design reviews, cost estimates, etc. on an on-call basis for one (1) to five (5) days per week (not every week, just as needed based on workload), part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services. All drawings are to be D size (24" x 36") in paper and electronic attachment, DWG format and shall be 100% compatible with Computer Assisted Design Drawing Software (CADD). Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing layer usage, and scale information for drawings. CADD Drawings shall conform to SJAFB CADD standard which is based on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers CADD STD 4.0 dated July 2009. CADD drawing sets shall use the Drawing Sheet Set Manager, drawing templates, and layer standards as described in SJAFB CADD standards. Title blocks shall remain unaltered and title block data shall be updated utilizing the Sheet Set Manager. The selected firm must have the capability of providing final drawings formatted in AutoCAD 2012 or higher, drawings produced using AutoCAD LT versions are unacceptable. Each final drawing set shall be provided using the "E-Transmit" function of AutoCAD, and provided on CD-ROM formatted for the Windows operating system. On occasion, Building Information Modeling (BIM) may be requested or required (see http://www.wbdg.org/references/afbim.php). Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm or its sub-contractors. The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&amp;M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work. All offerors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to receiving a contract award.

Q&A attachment added.

*************************************************
Original Announcement on 10/09/2014:

(1) INTRODUCTION
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ASR-9 RADAR Operational Support Group (AJW-146) may have an upcoming requirement for redesign, manufacture/ production, and procurement of one of two options:  

Option 1:  The COHO CCA/Module or;  
Option 2:  The Phase Shifter daughter CCA (only).   

The COHO CCA/Module is comprised of (2) Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA):  the Coherent Oscillator (COHO) main board CCA and the Phase Shifter daughter CCA and; a molded hardened aluminum chassis casing.  The Phase Shifter daughter CCA plugs into the COHO main board CCA.  

This Market Survey is for redesign and production of the entire COHO CCA/Module, Option 1, or the Phase Shifter CCA only, Option 2.   

For Option 1, the FAA is looking for a form, fit, and functional replacement which means that through redesign vendors are free to combine what can currently be categorized as sub-assemblies or components of the COHO main board CCA (e.g. the Phase Shifter unit and/or the Oscillator Assembly) onto the COHO main board CCA if desired.

Option 2 is a form, fit, and functional replacement of the Phase Shifter daughter CCA.

This requirement would support the present national deployment of 132 Airport Surveillance RADAR (ASR) model-9 locations throughout National Airspace System (NAS). It is the FAAs intent, via the replacement of the COHO CCA/Module to continue sustainment of an aging system that is encountering obsolescence problems such as Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).

Several piece parts that comprise the COHO have been identified as discontinued or obsolete including a component on the main subunit, the Phase Shifter.  The FAA is no longer able to obtain repair support of the Phase Shifter as repair piece parts are no longer available and, in the future, anticipates problems with the COHO main board CCA as more components become obsolete.

The FAA is seeking companies with experience in design of RF circuits, CCAs, and assemblies, with particular emphasis on radar RF circuitry and to include technical expertise, corporate knowledge, facilities, manufacturing / assembly equipment, logistics, configuration management and quality control provisions.

(2) NATURE OF COMPETITION
The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time.  This determination for the level of competition will be based on the results of this market survey.

(3) STANDARD LANGUAGE
(a) This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposals of any kind;
(b) The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;
(c) The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey, and responses will not be returned;
(d) Any costs associated with the market survey submittal is solely at the interested vendors expense;
(e) The FAA reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey; 
(f) Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted; and
(g) Any confidential or proprietary information submitted in response to this announcement must be marked accordingly by the vendor.  Such information will not be disclosed outside of the acquisition team.

(4) NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 750 employees.

(5) SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET SURVEY
The FAA requires the following (limited to 35 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with the attached COHO CCA/Module and the Phase Shifter daughter CCA drawings and specifications:

(a) Capability Statement  This document shall identify:
(i) Type of products/services provided by your firm
(ii) Size and types of products/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)
(iii) Number of years in business

(b) Clearly state whether or not you can manufacture the COHO CCA/Module:  the COHO main board CCA, the Phase Shifter daughter CCA, and the molded hardened aluminum casing in accordance with the attached specifications and drawings.

(c) Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses, if applicable.

Additionally, for submissions to this market survey, include the following information:
(a) Name and Address of your Company; URL of Company website (if applicable), and Point of Contact with telephone number.
(b) Do you have and use a Quality Assurance (QA) process?
(c) Is your company ISO certified? Identify which certification
(d) Does your company have experience in design and/or manufacture of RF Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA)s for the U.S. Government?  Identify the agency, number of years and describe experience.
(e) Does your company plan to redesign the main COHO main board CCA, the Phase Shifter daughter card /module, and the molded hardened aluminum casing (in part or full) or does you company only perform one or more but not all of the desired requirements (e.g. design and procurement of parts only but manufacturing of CCAs are sub-contracted out)?
(f) What is your estimated time period for redesign of both options?
(g) What is your potential monthly production/delivery rate?
(h) Identify warranty policies, extended warranty programs
(i) Provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) and identify any quantity discounts. This ROM will be used for planning purposes only. The ROM should include shipping cost to the FAA Logistics Center in Oklahoma City, OK.

<DESC><strong>PROJECT DETAILS: CA FTNP YOSE PRES 1(14) Yosemite N.P. Tunnel Preservation</strong>
<p>This project is located on Big Oak Flat Road (CA Route 120) within Yosemite National Park in Mariposa County, California. The project includes preventative maintenance work to Big Oak Flat Road Tunnels No. 1, 2 and 3. The project starts approximately 1 mile west of the intersection with El Portal Road in Yosemite Valley. The proposed work primarily consists of spot repair of damaged reinforced concrete tunnel lining, sealing leaking joints in tunnel liners, improving tunnel liner drainage to existing drainage channel along roadway, installing trench drains across roadway, coring 3 inch weep holes in existing concrete curb and removing and replacing damaged concrete roadway slabs.</p>
<p>Tunnel No. 1 is 371 feet long with a cross section of a 14.5 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, and an 18-inch thick reinforced concrete lining. Tunnel No. 2 is 227 feet long with a cross section of a 14.5 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, and an 18-inch thick reinforced concrete lining. Tunnel No. 3 is 2,087 feet long with a cross section of a 14 foot radius arch on a five foot spring line, with a lining which varies from reinforced concrete to exposed rock with a thin layer of shotcrete.</p>
<p>The project is located in Yosemite Valley within the National Park which has high visitation and sensitive resources. The tunnels are on Big Oak Flat Road which has average daily traffic of approximately 1,500 vehicles. Construction caused traffic delays will be limited to 15 minutes during daytime work and 30 minutes during nighttime work with one lane closures allowed.</p>
<p>The project requires specialized, highly technical work within the tunnels while maintaining one lane of traffic at all times. Concrete spall repairs will require location of the actual extent of deteriorated or delaminated concrete by the contractor, including location of the existing reinforcing bars. Chemical grout injection repairs will require qualified personnel with documented previous experience. Acceptance of the grout injection repairs will be based on performance requirements for stopping leaks. All concrete pavement and spall repairs will be integrally colored to match existing treatments, and colored joint sealant will need to be provided to match adjacent sidewalks. All wash water from power washing operations will need to be contained and filtered before being discharged or disposed of.</p>
<p>This project will require approximately 12,000 LNFT of joint and crack sealing (tunnel liner), 91,000 SQFT of tunnel cleaning (power washing), 130 SQYD of reinforced concrete pavement (at tunnel portals), 900 SQFT of concrete pavement patch (within tunnels), 50 SQFT of concrete spall repairs (tunnel liner), and 100 LNFT of coring/pressure grouting (tunnel liner leak repairs). In addition the project will require approximately 800 LNFT of 6 inch underdrain pipe installation and 2 inlets within the tunnels, and 80 LNFT of trench drains just inside the portals.</p>
<p>This project is located in a challenging and highly sensitive location in Yosemite Valley within the National Park, and great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of tunnel repairs, quality control, traffic control and timely completion of work.</p>
<p>Construction is anticipated from February to May 2015. The approximate range for this project is between $1 million and $3 million.</p>

 Request for Information
For
 DYNAMIC AEROMEDICAL EJECTION SEAT TRAINING SYSTEM 



INTRODUCTION: The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is defining its acquisition strategy for the aeromedical ejection seat training system program.
The U.S Navy currently utilizes a dynamic ejection seat training device, also known as Device 9E6, to train aviation personnel in proper pre-ejection procedures and to familiarize them with the sensations experienced during an actual ejection in order to promote proper body position and confidence in emergency survival equipment. Device 9E6 is part of an ejection seat curriculum that includes a lecture on potential injuries and proper body position, static seat trainer activities on proper body position and basic seat familiarization, and the dynamic device.
 NAWCTSD has  and estimated budget of $2.0-2.5M with which to provide two devices suitable for simultaneous ejections seat training for the next 15 years.  The purpose of this request for information is to obtain feedback from industry to assist in determining the best approach in meeting the Governments requirements. Specifically, the Government is interested in solutions consisting of a service life extension program (SLEP) for two of the existing dynamic ejection seat trainers or two new trainers to replace the existing dynamic ejection seat trainers. Of the available strategies, NAWCTSD is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) and Total Small Business set-aside.
 The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, or Small Business entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. You are advised that the Government is seeking to define the applicability of the requirement with regard to the available socio-economic programs. From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy. Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your companys business interests. If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis.
 Therefore, information from both large and small business is requested. It is anticipated that any resulting contract would be accomplished under the provisions of a firm-fixed-priced (FFP) contract. The following NAICS code 333318 with the size standard of 1,000 employees will be used in this acquisition.

TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:

The Government envisions solutions for the dynamic aeromedical ejection seat trainer that meets the following requirements:	
1)	The trainer shall emulate the complete ejection process including the function and operation of the manual override handle
2)	The trainer shall provide indications of incorrect body positioning via sensors (e.g., chicken wings, feet on rudder pedals, when looking up, or when shoulders are back)
3)	The trainer shall provide visual indication easily viewable from the instructor station (e.g.
 lights on the front of the device) of the status of ejection-readiness conditions (e.g., safety pins have been removed, leg restraints have been fastened, lap belt has been fastened, shoulder harness has been fastened, feet have been placed correctly, and the throttle and canopy are positioned).
4)	The trainer shall allow the instructor to override ejection as a safety feature.
5)	The trainer shall produce a continuous G force exposure between 2-4 positive Gz over a minimum vertical travel of 5 feet not to exceed 15 feet at maximum height from the point of initiation.
6)	At no time during the entire Gz ejection seat training shall the dynamic simulation exceed an instantaneous exposure of more than 6 Gz total for a period longer than 1/200th of a second.
7)	The trainer shall have appropriative Gz force monitoring equipment / safety sensors to ensure Gz forces are not exceeded.
8)	The trainer prevents operation via dynamic motion cessation.
9)	The trainer shall allow the operator (personnel) to return the seat to the home position when commanded.
10)	The Trainer seat travel shall be tilted backwards 15% - 18 % to match the Martin Baker Ejection Seats actual travel out of T-6, T-45 and F/A-18 E/F  and  G aircrafts.
11)	The trainer shall incorporate an ejection seat that is accurately representative of an actual fleet aircraft equipped ejection seat.
12)	Ejection simulation sequence shall be student initiated via an upward pull force on an actual Martin Baker Ejection Initiation Handle while strapped into an actual Martin Baker seats via the two waist and two shoulder straps.
13)	The breakout and fire pull forces of the ejection handle shall be in accordance with Aircraft Specific NATOPS requirements for each particular aircraft specific seat.
14)	The trainer shall provide, at a minimum, a one-way communication system between the trainee and the instructor that integrates with standard flight gear
15)	The trainer shall conform to the facility requirements as per Section 2 of the O and M Manual P-3779 (referenced in the GFI section of this document)
16)	The following table lists critical simulation and instructional attributes:
Integrates with standard flight gear
Integrates easily into the existing physical space and fits existing power capabilities
Provides safe sound limits and levels (decibels)
Requires a minimal number of staff for operation 
Easy to operate and maintain (with minimal training required for operation)
Use commercial and non-developmental items to the maximum extent practicable such that the  device can be maintained without the need for proprietary components or components that are difficult to find
Provides data and data distribution rights for all associated technical documentation 
Provides minimal requirements for proprietary tools or support equipment with components that are commercially available for replacement
Offers minimal requirement for technology refreshers and low Information Assurance (IA) requirements
Allow for minimal time for pre- and post-operational checks (less than 30 minutes)
Takes a reasonable amount of time to reset the device between trainees

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command has a requirement for the execution of work during the USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (CVN 75) Continuous Incremental Availability (CIA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from late 2014 to early 2015.&nbsp; CIA efforts include manpower, support services, design integration, engineering and management support, and technical data required to prepare for and accomplish this work during the availability.&nbsp; The work to be accomplished will include repair or replacement of shipboard nuclear propulsion components or systems along with installation of applicable Ship Change Documents.
<p>The requirement will be procured, without full and open competition, from the only qualified source capable of performing the CIA work for the USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (CVN 75) nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.&nbsp; Because of the unique certifications, capabilities, and expertise required to work on nuclear propulsion and other specialized systems (e.g. catapults, arresting gear, CIWS, etc.), the Government does not anticipate significant subcontracting opportunities for this requirement. &nbsp;Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Huntington Ingalls Incorporated - Newport News Shipbuilding directly.&nbsp; This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https: <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>. &nbsp;FBO is the single point of entry for the posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet.</p>

Under Step 1, amendments to this BAA will be issued as Topic Calls requesting white papers for specific topics issued on behalf of NSWCDD Technical Departments. Please keep your eyes open for Topic Call amendments related to DD09 Human Systems Integration Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>QUESTION 2: The following are the questions for recently published Broad Agency Announcement BAA N00178-14-Q-1200 Step 1 of this BAA, Topic Call(s) requesting white papers for specific topics:<br />1. Can we use published DD06 - Surface Combat Control Systems S&amp;T RDT&amp;E for submission of our white paper, or there will be sub-programs under this Topic Call (TC)?<br />2. Are there any restrictions or limitations on the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for this BAA? For instance our work is currently at the TRL4.<br />3. Are there any specific TRL' fund limitations?<br />4. Are there any DD06 restrictions for splitting the Financial Year (FY)? (For instance - 2014-2015 Financial Year (FY) phase TRL4 to TRL5) in sequential proposal knowing that overall project will require more phases and will be expanded into 2016-2017 FY</p>
<p>ANSWER 2: This is a multi-part answer in response to a multi-part question:<br />1. No white papers will be accepted under the basic BAA (Step 1), see above. Potential offerors should submit white papers in response to Step 2 "Topic Calls," which will be issued as amendments to the basic BAA.<br />2. Restrictions or limitations, if any, will be stipulated under the Step 2 Topic Calls. <br />3. See previous answer.<br />4. See previous answer.</p>
<p>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov. <br />This notice amends the basic BAA and does not constitute Topic Call. Therefore no white papers should be submitted at this time.<br />Any questions regarding this synopsis should be addressed to Debbie Frank at Deborah.N.Frank@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>Dugway Proving Grounds:  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, software, and programming to upgrade the Siemens Apogee Utility Monitoring and Control System and subsequent building level BACNET controls with integration in multiple buildings. This allows Dugway to upgrade to a secure platform and provide a single seat UMCS for energy management and Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) integration. Utilizing another contractor's system would adversely affect the installation systems continuity, reliability and the technical capabilities of the site to manage their base energy consumption. Also, providing a standard/secure UMCS provides the Government a platform for the ESPC contract to integrate the additional buildings at Dugway and provide a comprehensive system for energy use and conservation.  The Contractor shall supply all equipment to provide secure, complete, and usable systems.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to negotiate on a sole source basis. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary (USP), Atwater, California, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dish Network. This announcement constitutes the only notice of intent. A written notice will not be issued. This is an annual service contract agreement for satellite television services at USP Atwater. Specifically, the contract secures satellite television services to the inmate population for United States Penitentiary Atwater. Dish Network has been the satellite television service provider since activation of the institution. The framework and equipment is set up to support Dish Network. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written notification by mail or email to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be mailed to Celeste Walker, Contract Specialist, USP Atwater, 1 Federal Way, Atwater, CA 95301. Information can be emailed to c5walker@bop.gov. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT
This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with NetworkFleet, Inc. to fulfill a requirement for GPS fleet tracking. It is the Government's belief that only NetworkFleet, Inc. can provide these unique service requirements.
A redacted Limited Sources Justification is attached.

Responses to this notice must be provided within ten (10) calendar days from the date of this notice. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 2:00 P.M. HST, October 10, 2014. The responses may be submitted via e-mail to Nicole Do, Contract Officer, at Nicole.do@va.gov.
