<DESC>The Capable Manpower (CM) Future Naval Warfighter Capability (FNWC) program office at the Office of Naval Research, is inviting full proposals. These proposals should suggest innovative science and technology developments to overcome the capability gaps described later in this announcement. 

The Capable Manpower Future Naval Warfighter Capability program (CM) is a set of capability-development projects focused on the human performance aspects of the Navy and Marine Corps. CM supports work to further human-systems integration, particularly in the areas of human factors engineering, manpower and personnel, and training. 

In this announcement, the Navy and Marine Corps are seeking the development of innovative technology-based products to enable transformation in their Human Capital programs, targeted at human systems integration (HSI), that enable SYSCOM program managers to optimize total system performance, minimize total ownership costs, and ensure that systems are built to accommodate the characteristics of the user population that will operate, maintain, and support systems, for the warfighting pillars of Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, and FORCEnet. A description of these Sea Power 21 pillars can be found at: http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/proceedings.html. 

Reduced manning and increased mission requirements will demand greater competencies of Naval warfighters than ever before, and also greater synchrony among individual competencies, in teams and in interaction with complex systems. New approaches to performance support and system design are necessary to ensure that future combatants and related sea-service components are adequately staffed and have optimal readiness. 

The Capable Manpower Future Naval Warfighter Capability program is dedicated to development and focused transition of products to the Navy / Marine Corps. Products are new technologies, methodologies, processes, systems, and/or devices, together with evidence of their cost/effectiveness, based on research and development. The goal is to deliver these products to Navy / Marine Corps customers, to improve system design, utilization, training, and performance of Sailors and Marines, enabling significant Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Human Systems cost savings and improved warfighting readiness.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Progress Software Corporation, 14 Oak Park, Bedford MA 01730 for the purchase of fifty (50) Software License, Objectstore - Deployment Software Licenses on Solaris for MTIX Applicable Bundle with one (1) year of Maintenance.  Information received within 7 days after date of publication of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   The NAICS code is 541511.  

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  

Moving Target Information Expolitation (MTIX) is a tri-service (AF, Army, and Navy) deployment program that uses and OODB produced by Progress Software, called Objectstore.  AFRL expects to deploy these licenses in support of both operational and R&D efforts.  The manufacturer, Progress Software is uniquely qualified as the developer of this database and is the only existing responsible source for the software and associated license.  There would be both a substantial duplication of cost to the Governement and unnecessary delays in fullfulling requirements if an award is made to any other database software source.  To maintain this essential engineering, research & development capability for the DoD, Objectstore is required.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify interested parties of the upcoming Request for Proposal release for the Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI).  USTRANSCOM intends to issue an unrestricted solicitation, resulting in an indefinite delivery, requirements-type contract.  Period of performance for this contract will include a 3-year base period with two 1-year option periods, and the potential for the contractor to earn two additional 1-year award-term option periods, for a potential 7-year contract.  Solicitation release is scheduled on or about 21 Jun 06, and solicitation closing date is scheduled on or about 11 Aug 06.  Past and present performance information will be required to be submitted approximately 30 days after solicitation release.  This solicitation will be processed as a best-value source selection IAW DFARS 15.3 and USTRANSCOM/TCAQ Operating Instruction 05-11, TCAQ Source Selection Instructions.

DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations/load optimization and mode conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DOD shippers.  An implementation approach is envisioned with multiple phases based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements. 

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 488510 – Freight Transportation Arrangement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport has a requirement to establish a contractor managed Sight Conservation Program to obtain safety glasses for NUWCDIVNPT employees.  Our initiative is to establish a program that is responsive to Safety and Health issues as well as customer needs.  The system must be cost effective, efficient and responsive to customer needs.  The Standard which safety eyewear must meet is the current American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z87, this includes frames and lenses.  This program will provide all authorized NUWCDIVNPT employees direct ordering of safety glasses, fitting and repair of eyeglasses frames and permanently affixed side shields.  NUWCDIVNPT employees will also be authorized to purchase bifocals, trifocals, progressives, tinting and sunglasses.  Appointments will be made by telephone, fax or electronic means.  The selected vendor(s) will be required to record and maintain a system that tracks the type of glasses order, the end user, invoice and credit card numbers charged.

<CONTACT>Kim Louth, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-0712, Fax 301-480-3338, Email kl218h@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) NHLBI-WH-06-09 will be available on or about January 9, 2006.     The objective of the RFP is to maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data generated by the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) research studies.  The overall WHI program is intended to improve knowledge about the predictors and prevention of some of the more common diseases affecting older women (cardiovascular diseases, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, and fractures).  Because of their importance to public health, the BAA will expand existing efforts within WHI centered around these diseases.  However, extensive information was also collected on other outcomes, such as other cancers, cognition, and functional status, and proposals using these phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will also be considered.  NHLBI anticipates that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine.  This BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive yet efficient investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease outcomes.  Focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications.

Detailed information on the WHI program will be found at http://www.whiscience.org/. The NHLBI anticipates awarding contracts based on technical merit, available funds, and programmatic balance. Prospective Offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference on February 27, 2006, from 1:00-3:00 pm, at the Natcher Building on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland. NHLBI staff will explain the purpose of the initiative, provide instructions about the proposal process and answer questions. Questions provided by February 20, 2006 will be answered at the conference. Offeror institutions are urged to send a representative to this conference. All attendees, as well as anyone who cannot attend the pre-proposal conference, will be given access, through an amendment to the Solicitation, to any distributed materials, questions and answers, and a summary of the discussion. These materials and additional information about the meeting will be posted with the BAA. Attendance is not a pre-requisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.

This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although eight to ten awards are anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.     The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov.     Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.     It is also offerors’ responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP.     Letters of intent are due no later than February 10, 2006.     This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for 9 Paraffin Based Hybrid Rocket Fuel grains (14 inches in diameter by six feet long). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Space Propulsion Group Inc. (SPG Inc.) because SPG Inc. holds two patents on this class of fuels. The two patents are High Regression Rate Hybrid Propellants, # 6684624 and High Regression Rate Hybrid Rocket Propellants and Method of Selecting, # 6880326. The patents preclude any other company from manufacturing the fuel grains and therefore SPG Inc. is the only company that can be used for this purchase.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 26, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the design, development, test, and evaluation (DDT&E) of an engine to support the Core Stage of the Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle (CaLV).  The RS-68 engine was selected for this DDT&E effort because it is a high-performance, simple gas generator cycle engine utilizing liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as propellants.  The end item deliverable will be a certified engine design for the RS-68B.  NASA will develop the RS-68B jointly with the United States Air Force (USAF). Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, NASA intends to purchase this requirement from Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) Inc., 6633 Canoga Avenue, Canoga Park, California, 91309-7922.  PWR designed and developed the RS-68 series of engines and has been responsible for its production, refurbishment, and improvements.  PWR's unique capabilities with design, fabrication, production, and testing of the turbomachinery for the RS-68 series are presently employed on the USAF’s Delta IV program.  NASA performed an assessment of available engines for this application as part of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS).  Through the ESAS, NASA determined that the only US manufactured rocket engines that possess the performance capabilities required with a sufficient Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to fulfill agency requirements were the RS-25 and RS-68 (both developed and manufactured by PWR).  A further analysis showed a potential for significant cost savings by utilizing the RS-68 engine.  In addition, PWR has recent experience on other major engine development activities such as the RS-83, RS-84, and COBRA.	The production effort for the engine beyond the requirements of the DDT&E effort will be a separate procurement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 27, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact PWR directly. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Army Research, Development and Engineering Center (USARDEC), ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA- C), 401 Lee Blvd., Ft. Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.  POC Ms Sandra Schuck, Contract Specialist, 757-878-4819.   AATD is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.3 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein and the referenced supplemental package.  This Broad Age ncy Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may permit extensions to the proposal submission date.   INTRODUCTION: The Army desires to transition its aviation fleet to Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), as directed by the DoD Logistics Transformation Strategy and the Army Aviation CBM Plus Plan.  This BAA is responsive to the Armys plan to mature embedde d diagnostics and prognostics. Current maintenance is reactive to faults, not proactive, resulting in an excessive logistics support burden and high O&S costs. The Army S&T goal to decrease O&S cost by reducing maintenance, which was derived from the Rotar y Wing Vehicle Technology Development Approach and the Aviation S&T Strategic Planning Workshops, supports this transition to CBM.  Specific 2010 program metrics are 25% Reduction in Inspections/ Flight Hour, 8% Reduction in Maintenance Labor/ Flight Hour,  10% Increase in Component Mean Time Between Removals and less than 10% False Removal Rates measured against a 2005 fielded aircraft baseline. Technologies are required to provide aviation platforms the ability to accurately assess health and project failu re of critical aircraft components, based on actual usage in operational environments.  The Operations Support & Sustainment Technologies (OSST) program will develop and demonstrate an integrated set of diagnostic, prognostic and system health assessment technologies to support Army objectives and enable transition to a CBM based philosophy. Specific OSST objectives are reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance, expansion of serviceability criteria, extension of life or time between overhaul, and prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance.  Ma ny technical opportunities exist to enable implementing condition based maintenance; however there are several key technical challenges. High fault detection rates need to be achieved with minimal false alarms. A wide range of aircraft components and failu re modes need to be monitored with limited sensor data and a minimal weight penalty. Accurate estimates of remaining useful life for components across varying usage and environment are required. Various technologies such as physics of failure modeling, res idual strength/life prediction, wear prediction, performance models, system level reasoners and anomaly detection may be used to address these challenges. This program will result in an integrated set of demonstrated technologies that can be transitioned t o support CBM. For this program, transition is defined as implementation of the technologies, after successful completion of this program, into a fielded Army rotary wing aircraft (CH-47, UH-60, AH-64, ARH-70).  This OSST BAA will be limited to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development. Efforts under this BAA will mature and demonstrate the technologies required to provide useful prognostics and system health information to support maintenance and operational decisions.  Through this effort, technologies are expected to be matured to a TRL 6 (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment), as well as be on a path for transition. Demonstration testing shall be full scale and representative of the expected  aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to validate the capability, accuracy and robustness of the technologies TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION The Government is seeking an integrated OSST solution that will reduce the future maintenance burden, reduce O&S costs, and enable implementation of CBM methodologies. Specifically, the Government desires an integrated set of technolo gies to allow: reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance; expansion of serviceability criteria; extension of life or time between overhaul; prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance. Open systems architec ture and use of common data standards are required. Proposed technologies shall be demonstrated to validate their capability, accuracy and functionality of sensors, interfaces and algorithms. Integration into an on-board data collection, processing, and st orage device shall be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the technologies as a single solution. Methodology for demonstration of proposed technologies as well as an integrated solution shall be addressed. Offerors shall address each o f the six rotorcraft technology areas, listed below as an integrated solution. Offerors shall describe a clear path for transition and quantifiable benefits relative to the 2010 metrics. Propulsion   Efforts under this technical area should focus on engine system diagnostics and performance prognostics. Army data shows low power or torque as the highest engine removal cause and power management as a driver in engine related accidents. FOD and erosion contribute to these removals for low performance. Errors in torque measurement add to the variability of power predictions, impact engine removals and reduce the fidelity assessment of usage monitoring. There are ongoing efforts demonstrating a dvanced engine diagnostics and on-board automatic power available algorithms.  Development efforts should build upon current work to provide accurate, on-board fault isolation of engine components and prognostication of engine performance. Drive Systems/Mechanical Components Advanced Technology Development efforts for the drive systems efforts should demonstrate advanced diagnostic techniques. Algorithms for detecting gear and bearing failures through vibration have been developed and demonstrated using test stand data. Planet ary gear fault detection remains difficult with current diagnostic techniques. Internal debris generating failures can be detected for ferrous components through current chip detectors but advanced non ferrous or non metallic materials are not covered. Det ection of corrosion on the cases of transmissions and gearboxes, mounting locations and fasteners is possible but has not been fully demonstrated.  Electrical Power & Wiring Efforts should focus on the accurate diagnostics of electrical system components. Reliable and clean electrical power is essential for aircraft operation. The quality of power affects mission reliability and can impact high value avionics and controls. Pow er problems can lead to inaccurate BIT messages, no fault founds and component false removals. Proposed tasks should demonstrate the ability to determine the health of electrical components such as generators, power converters and batteries.   Structures Structural maintenance labor and cost will be reduced by more accurately calculating service life expended and managing the helicopters structural integrity. Advanced Technology Development is needed to validate the ability to effectively diagnose and man age rotorcraft structural integrity. This can be accomplished through technology demonstration efforts that ascertain localized loads from global aircraft parameters, accurately predict remaining service life, and support assignment of usage credits based upon a comparison between design life and actual usage. Rotors & Dynamic Components Rotors and their associated dynamic components operate i n high-cycle and environmentally challenging conditions. Maintenance of the dynamic hub components (spherical bearings, bushings, pushrods, root end couplings, etc.) is driven by high-cycle fatigue, while blade maintenance is predominantly driven by impact  damage (e.g., ballistic damage, delaminations, voids). Advanced Technology Development is needed to demonstrate the ability to monitor and effectively diagnose the integrity of the rotor system, which includes tracking actual usage, actively detecting dam age, and providing ample data to support either the assignment of usage credits or a reduced inspection/diagnostics effort once damage has occurred. Offerors need to consider the unique challenges in reliably transferring data and power across the rotating  frame (rotating component to static airframe). Flight Controls & Hydraulics  Current aircraft flight control and hydraulic system components require specific maintenance dedicated to pre-flight inspections, post-flight pilot recommendations, and routine maintenance actions.  Due to inconvenient component locations and system comple xity, current inspection techniques of flight control and hydraulic system components (hydraulic lines, servos, pumps, bell cranks, bearings, electronics, actuators, etc.) are labor intensive and often result in low fidelity diagnosis. This often leads to fixing failures by replacing several costly subsystems rather than replacing specific faulty components (e.g. completely replacing a servo instead of fixing a faulty servo component).  Advanced Technology Development is needed to demonstrate the ability to  effectively monitor, diagnose, and manage the service life of the aircrafts flight control and hydraulic components.  This can be accomplished through a technology demonstration effort that tracks actual component usage, detects damage, and provides ampl e data to support the assignment of usage credits to life-limited components. Deliverable Items:  The program will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan, (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (4) Final Report, (5) Final Briefing at Ft.

Perform quality assurance and completeness screening on the data to ensure consistency and reliability 3. Apply software to adjust short period of record station averages to 1971-2000 period 4. Use the PRISM model to create 1971-2000 mean monthly and annual grids of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature for the CCRB and a small buffer region around its perimeter 5. Merge the Canadian Columbia River Basin grids with the appropriate grids from conterminous United States to create one grid per month per element for the entire US/CCRB region 6.

<DESC>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.  On January 1, 1981, The NHTSA issued Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, Child Restraint Systems.  FMVSS No. 213 specifies various performance tests which include material test and dynamic test.  FMVSS No. 213 sets forth the performance requirements for many types of child restraint systems.  It includes the testing provisions which are necessary to determine whether a restraint system meets those performance requirements.  The test provisions include material tests which are intended to verify webbing, hardware and other components of a child restraint system comply with the requirements of those components. 

Specific Requirements:  NHTSA intends to procure testing services and reports so that the Government can determine whether child restraint system components comply with the requirements of FMVSS No. 213. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary qualified technical personnel, facilities, and equipment to perform testing services necessary to determine conformance of child restraint components, provided to the contractor as Government Furnished Test Items (GTFI), with the applicable requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems. Either whole child restraints or individual components will be provided. 

Contract Award:   NHTSA intends to award multiple Firm Fixed Price contracts with a base year to include optional quantities during year one (1) of the contract.  The contract will also include a provision by which two 24-month option periods can be exercised (in two-year increments) resulting in a total possible performance period of five (5) years. 

This solicitation is full and open competition. 

Solicitation:  The solicitation DTNH22-07-R-00011 will be available for downloading from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about February 26, 2007.  All questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to chelly.johnson-jones@nhtsa.dot.gov no later than March 5, 2007.  The anticipated award date for this resultant contract is expected on or about June 15, 2007.

The contractor shall respond to all identified security problems on CCAFS.  The contractor shall provide security of the perimeter of CCAFS.  The contractor shall staff certain designated internal secondary perimeter posts for the protection of priority resources.  

Due to the mission of the 45th Space Wing at CCAFS the contractor will need the ability to surge manning for space launch operations, launch vehicle processing, and contingencies (physical security malfunctions/failures, or immediate threat conditions).

The contractor will maintain an alternate CSC.  The CSC will be operated by an armed security force member.  Maintainers of such equipment are required to maintain a DoD Secret security clearance.

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a Security Management Plan (SMP).  This SMP will be submitted to the Security Functional, 45 SFS/S6, for concurrence.  The SMP will specify the Contractor's implementation of security for priority resources.  The SMP shall support the daily operational missions and threats of CCAFS plus the various contingencies to ensure security of priority resources.  The plan shall include the integration of security requirements for resources protection; methodology for expanding the workforce when required to support variable security needs; command, control, and communication procedures for Security Forces; and maintenance of Security Forces personnel qualifications.          

The contractor would maintain public safety and the safety of the workforce.  The contractor would maintain safe and secure operating locations and be flexible and innovative in protecting and preserving physical and environmental assets.  The contractor would professionally manage resources and the infrastructure to ensure sustainability, reliability, energy conservation and cost efficiency of the facilities, systems and equipment at CCAFS.

<SUBJECT>A -- Conduct Second Follow-up of Patients Enrolled in the Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study
<SOLNBR>NIAAA-07-07
<RESPDATE>033007
<CONTACT>Patricia Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a second follow-up study of subjects who were previously enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) of combined medication and behavioral therapy for alcoholism.  

RTI is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency's requirement because (1) RTI is the sole owner of critical previously collected data on human subjects, (2)
has extensive experience necessary to conduct the study proposed  for the current contract; and  (3) no other source can supply the services and data that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this study.

Development of the original study, called Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE), was initiated in 1998 and supported by NIAAA under a co-operative agreement.  Data collection was begun in 2001.  In COMBINE, 1383 subjects were randomized to medications: one, both or neither (placebo) naltrexone or acamprosate combined.  In addition to the medication subjects were assigned to either (a) a 16-week behavioral therapy or (b) no behavioral therapy.  Eleven recruitment/ treatment sites and one co-coordinating center participated in COMBINE.  Extensive information was collected on subjects, including data from numerous questionnaires over several time points, tissue samples and genetic analyses.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) participated in development of data collection instruments.
 
A 5-year grant for a follow-up study (Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol Treatment) was awarded to RTI in 2002.  Eight hundred thirty-five subjects and 9 of the 11 original study sites participated in this, the first COMBINE follow-up study.  Follow-up data but no treatments were administered under this study.  A series of in-person interviews were conducted at the 9 participating sites.  Data collection for this study will conclude in the fall of 2006.  Most participants at the 9 sites provided informed consent to (a) be interviewed and (b) have their data from the COMBINE study, with identifiers, linked to data collected under the first-follow-up study.  Under the grant mechanism, these data belong to the grantee, RTI.  In addition to these data, the study maintained records of subject location information and one or two personal contacts useful for tracing subjects who moved and/or changed phone numbers.  

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIAAA plans to conduct the second COMBINE follow-up study using a single contractor (RTI) and telephone interviews.  The contractor will help design and gain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study.  Confidential contact information, already maintained through the RTI grant, will be used to track currently-enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be provided with details of the new follow-up study and asked to provide informed consent for the new study.  Four half-hour telephone interviews, planned at yearly intervals, will be administered to consenting subjects.  Development of the interviews will be done by personnel familiar with the COMBINE and first follow-up instruments.  As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the second follow-up study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants' confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants' confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the second follow-up phase as described.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the Research Triangle Institute is the only source capable of performing this requirement due their ownership of the data and prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their work under the Cooperative Agreement and performing as the grantee for the COMBINE study under the NIAAA Grant.   

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in obtaining the required data.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the second follow-up study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants' confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants' confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the second follow-up phase as described.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the Research Triangle Institute is the only source capable of performing this requirement due their ownership of the data and prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their work under the Cooperative Agreement and performing as the grantee for the COMBINE study under the NIAAA Grant.   

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in obtaining the required data.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Conduct Second Follow-up of Patients Enrolled in the Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study
<SOLNBR>NIAAA-07-07
<RESPDATE>033007
<CONTACT>Patricia Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a second follow-up study of subjects who were previously enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) of combined medication and behavioral therapy for alcoholism.  

RTI is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency's requirement because (1) RTI is the sole owner of critical previously collected data on human subjects, (2)
has extensive experience necessary to conduct the study proposed  for the current contract; and  (3) no other source can supply the services and data that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this study.

Development of the original study, called Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE), was initiated in 1998 and supported by NIAAA under a co-operative agreement.  Data collection was begun in 2001.  In COMBINE, 1383 subjects were randomized to medications: one, both or neither (placebo) naltrexone or acamprosate combined.  In addition to the medication subjects were assigned to either (a) a 16-week behavioral therapy or (b) no behavioral therapy.  Eleven recruitment/ treatment sites and one co-coordinating center participated in COMBINE.  Extensive information was collected on subjects, including data from numerous questionnaires over several time points, tissue samples and genetic analyses.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) participated in development of data collection instruments.
 
A 5-year grant for a follow-up study (Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol Treatment) was awarded to RTI in 2002.  Eight hundred thirty-five subjects and 9 of the 11 original study sites participated in this, the first COMBINE follow-up study.  Follow-up data but no treatments were administered under this study.  A series of in-person interviews were conducted at the 9 participating sites.  Data collection for this study will conclude in the fall of 2006.  Most participants at the 9 sites provided informed consent to (a) be interviewed and (b) have their data from the COMBINE study, with identifiers, linked to data collected under the first-follow-up study.  Under the grant mechanism, these data belong to the grantee, RTI.  In addition to these data, the study maintained records of subject location information and one or two personal contacts useful for tracing subjects who moved and/or changed phone numbers.  

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIAAA plans to conduct the second COMBINE follow-up study using a single contractor (RTI) and telephone interviews.  The contractor will help design and gain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study.  Confidential contact information, already maintained through the RTI grant, will be used to track currently-enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be provided with details of the new follow-up study and asked to provide informed consent for the new study.  Four half-hour telephone interviews, planned at yearly intervals, will be administered to consenting subjects.  Development of the interviews will be done by personnel familiar with the COMBINE and first follow-up instruments.  As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the second follow-up study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants' confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants' confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the second follow-up phase as described.

A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) has a requirement for a secured bed detention facility to house up to 1,000 detainees (male only) in the custody of the U.S Department of Justice, United States Marshals Services (USMS) and the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The successful offeror will provide a Contractor-owned and operated facility capable of housing up to 900 USMS detainees charged with federal offenses, detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, and 100 ICE detainees awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation. The facility shall be located within 75 miles of the Lloyd D. George - U.S. Federal Courthouse, 333 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Suite 2058, Las Vegas, NV 89101.  The successful offeror will be required to provide all personnel, services, equipment, material, supplies (to include full medical services and all transportation services within 250 miles of the facility) required for management and operation of a secure detention facility. 

Offeror will be required to provide information to the Government to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq., and the implementing regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 1500. To qualify for participation in this procurement, all potential offerors shall submit the following information for each site for which the offeror plans to provide a proposal. Not later than January 31, 2007, the offeror shall submit a Phase I Survey conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), E-1527-97, "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process." The Phase I Survey shall include, as a "Non-Scope Consideration" under Chapter 12 of the Standard Practice, a delineation or identification of on-site wetlands, and an analysis of potential impacts to threaten or endangered species or species of special status. The identification of on-site wetlands should include and on-site reconnaissance level survey/report by a qualified wetlands specialist, the National Wetlands Inventory map for the project area, and an identification of hydric soils on the proposed property. The analysis of potential impacts to threatened and endangered species of special status should include a site reconnaissance report identifying potential habitat or presence of protected species (plant and animal) lists. Failure to submit the Phase I Survey by January 31, 2007 shall preclude that site from being considered for this procurement. The Government will only accept offers for which a Phase I Survey has been timely submitted. All other offers will be rejected.  All information submitted as a part of the Phase I Survey shall be considered non-proprietary and, at the discretion of the Government, be made public during the Scoping process under NEPA or at any other appropriate time. 

To be considered, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission it has corporate experience operating secure detention facilities over a continuous three-year period as of the date the RFP was issued. Note, point ventures will be considered as long as one partner meets the corporate experience requirement. Multiple proposals from one offeror will not be accepted.  OFDT intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for an estimated term of 20 years (base period of five years and three (3) five year option years). The Government reserves its right to negotiate the terms of the contract. Interested parties are advised that Past Performance and Experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers and award selection shall be made on a Best Value basis.   Consideration will be given for new construction, expansion, renovation or use of an existing facility.

OFDT estimates issuing the solicitation on or about April 1, 2007.  All interested parties requiring further information should send an email to Lori.Ray@usdoj.gov.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institute on Drug Abuse to solicit, negotiate and award a continuation of a current Purchase Order with Susan David, Ph.D. for an additional 612 hours. The period of performance for the additional hours is anticipated to be 9 months. This order is being conducted under FAR 13.  Ms. David is currently performing the following services.  NIDA has several research networks, such as the Community Epidemiology Work Group, the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies and the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) collecting data at sites throughout the country.  These networks operate independently from one another and the level of communication among them likely varies widely.  The purpose is to explore whether there is any value added to enhancing the communication among the networks.  It is possible that the data emerging from these networks can not only inform the activities of the other networks, but may also stimulate new research opportunities and collaborations among the established networks.  Further, research dissemination efforts could be enhanced through collaborations with the Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs) supported by both SAMHSA and NIDA similar to the dissemination projects that have been developing between the CTN and ATTCs.  A recompetition of this requirement would cause significant delays in the ongoing data collection and analysis.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. 

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI70045 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer   

AMENDMENT ONE DATED FEBRUARY 13, 2007 IS ISSUED TO AMEND THE ABOVE NOTICE TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

Susan L. David, Ph.D., LLC is located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The services to be performed include:  provide consultation to NIDA on a model communication effort across the aforementioned networks, assist with incorporating plans for dissemination, and evaluate models and lessons learned.  Dr. David will continue to write an assessment of the model communication effort and dissemination plans across the networks.  

Dr. David has experience in the development of model communication plans of similar networks for local hospitals and hospital associations.  She also coordinated a network effort to respond to the "Not in my BackYar" initiative, which was keeping drug abuse treatment programs from being built in communities across the country.  She has also provided workshops on model communication efforts and dissemination plans.     The additional hours are in order to complete the written assessment of a potential model communication plan for NIDA.

For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is  December 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.     Point of Contact Susan Hwang, 808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Waterless Based Hand Antiseptic Sanitizer. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $90,358.00 this is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information,  and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the decision makers for thi s initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to particip ate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert like one to five rating sc ale. One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered accep table and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the  MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 year s).  1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: 1.

<DESC>The Maintenance & Logistics Command Pacific is seeking industry comments and potential sources for its plan to solicit a multi-ship multi-option (MSMO) Phased Maintenance (PM) type contract similar to the Phased Maintenance contracts that the U.S. Navy has implemented for its ships.  This contract would be for support of USCG 378' High Endurance cutters home ported in Alameda, CA.

The proposed contract is not simply a re-packaging of previous Coast Guard contracts for dockside and dry dock repairs into a multi-year contract.  It differs significantly from the model previously used by the Coast Guard.  Under that model, the Coast Guard developed detailed specifications, bids were taken, and award made.  Here, rather than hiring a contractor to perform work packages specified by the government, this contract seeks a single Maintenance Integrator.  It is a complete paradigm shift, moving the 378’ WHEC maintenance program in line with Best Practices pioneered and refined by the U.S. Navy during the past 20 years in its PM contracting programs, and the Best Practices of the ship repair industry.  After testing and refining these practices beginning in the late 1980’s and into the 1990’s, the U. S. Navy has largely abandoned its traditional, single ship repair contracting program in favor of these multi-ship, multi-option (MSMO) type of contracting vehicles.

This acquisition will seek a single maintenance integrator to develop, plan, manage, and execute all commercial depot level maintenance for the WHEC class in Alameda under a single contract.  The contractor will participate as a full member of MLCPAC’s Acquisition Team in reviewing maintenance needs, performing detailed ship checking, writing of the repair specification for USCG approval, development of the final work execution plan prior to the star of work, work execution.  Complete integration of maintenance management activities is crucial to the PM concept, the key to which is active involvement of the integrator into all phases of the maintenance cycle.   It is from this complete integration that MLCPAC expects to obtain the same cost savings and efficiencies and savings of critical maintenance days that have been achieved by the Navy.  By switching to the single maintenance integrator model, the Coast Guard expects to duplicate the both the reductions in maintenance costs and maintenance days that the Navy has achieved since moving to the Phased Maintenance model.

Execution of work will be either at the cutter’s home berth in Alameda, CA, or at the contractor’s commercial dry dock facility.  The Pacific Area Commander has restricted dry dock repairs to the immediate San Francisco Bay Area.  Prospective contractors would need to either possess their own USCG certified dry dock facility or have access to a USCG certified dry dock facility in the Bay Area.  At present MLCPAC is aware of only two suitable dry dock facilities within the area of restriction established by the PACAREA Commander, one operated by a small business and one by a large business.

Comments from industry regarding the proposed plan are encouraged.  In particular, MLCPAC is interested in determining how many small businesses may be interested in competing for the award, especially small businesses that would choose to compete by establishing partnerships or teaming arrangements with other businesses, small or large, or by relocating new or existing ship lifting facilities to the Bay Area.

This notice seeks only potential sources and industry comment.  Offers are not being solicited and if received will not be considered.  Based on industry comment and MLCPAC needs, the Coast Guard's requirements will be finalized and a solicitation may be issued at a future date.  The preferred method for submission of comments and information is via attachment to email to the addressees listed below.  To be considered, input must be received not later than close of business on Thursday, December 8, 2005.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is conducting this market survey to identify small businesses with the capability to serve as the Clinical Trials Coordinating Center (CTCC) for a large, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, three-arm trial comparing a strategy of  initiation of warfarin therapy based on an algorithm using both clinical and genotypic information on genetic variants in two genes known to influence warfarin metabolism (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes) versus a strategy of initiation of warfarin therapy based on an algorithm using only clinical information and versus a standard, guideline-based strategy. The trial will randomize approximately 2,000 participants with any indication for chronic long term anticoagulation and no previous treatment with warfarin.  Participants will be recruited over 18 months and followed for one year. The CTCC in collaboration with the trial Steering Committee will select and coordinate a network of clinical sites that can adequately select a large number of eligible participants, randomize and follow them according to a trial protocol, and obtain genotyping data.  In addition to acquiring genotypic and clinical data, the trial will include detailed measurements of anticoagulation status, collection of detailed information on factors (nutritional, pharmacologic and others) influencing the anticoagulation status, and collection of quality of life and cost-effectiveness data.  The trial will include a central laboratory to serve as a DNA repository for quality control of the local genotypic laboratories and DNA storage for future analyses.  The study may also include core facilities for performance of future genetic analyses.  Only one contract will be awarded for this project.

The CTCC will coordinate all aspects of the research and manage and analyze patient and research (both clinical and genotypic) data.  The CTCC will manage and coordinate the efforts of the clinical sites.  It is expected that 15 clinical sites in the United States will be required to enroll the number of patients needed for the study.  The Principal Investigators from the CTCC and clinical sites, and the NHLBI Project Officer will form a Steering Committee that serves to provide scientific direction to the program.   The CTCC will prepare confidential reports and analyses for NHLBI review committees including a Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  CTCC personnel must be knowledgeable and experienced in the design, conduct and analysis of pharmacogenomic studies, as well as in large, complex, multicenter clinical trials in thromboembolic diseases or other randomized prospective clinical trials of similar complexity.  Medical and scientific expertise in pharmacogenomics and in clinical conditions requiring oral anticoagulation, in data collection, management, monitoring, quality control, management of medication side effects and adverse reactions to drug therapy, data analysis and reporting is required. Institutional ability in dealing with regulatory issues involving genetic analyses is required, and with quality control and analysis of genome-wide association and sequencing data.  The CTCC will provide leadership in the statistical issues including the design of a study protocol and analysis of study data.  The CTCC will be responsible for the design or selection and management of data collection tools and ensuring quality control, including the design and management of a study website. The CTCC will coordinate the randomization of patients into the trial and will be responsible for maintenance of data forms, computer systems for storage and retrieval, and for ensuring the timely collection, entry and editing of the data.  The CTCC should be able to provide continuous assistance to the clinical sites for issues related to study execution. The CTCC will also be responsible for coordinating communications among the various components of the study, and for scheduling meetings and conference calls of the study committees as needed.  The CTCC will also organize the PRC and DSMB meetings and prepare statistical reports and the minutes of these meetings.  The CTCC in collaboration with the NHLBI will arrange and conduct site visits to the clinical sites.  

The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of 3 1/2 years.  The contract will be a cost-reimbursement, completion-type. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND NO RFP IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. Small businesses who believe they possess the capabilities to perform this work must submit an original and three copies of a capability statement to this office by 4:00 PM EST on February 28, 2006. Responses to this market survey should include pertinent information and meet the requirements of this notice. All information submitted in response to this notice must arrive on or before the closing date and time. Capability statements should be submitted to the following address: Lawrence M. Butler, Contracting Officer, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockledge 2 Building, Room 6104, 6701 Rockledge Drive, MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902.

<DESC>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the informatio n solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will  be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on F-16 ARC-210 SATCOM Antenna that have already been developed and may be modified to meet the agency requirem ent as listed below:   AATC is conducting an effort to determine potential industry sources for a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Antenna configuration for Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) F-16C Block (25, 30, 32) aircraft. This announcement is for marke t research and does not constitute an RFP.   AATC is seeking contractors who are interested in providing an affordable antenna using the latest Commercial off-The Shelf (COTS) technology with minor modifications as part of an Operational Test and Evaluation effort (OT&E).  A No Cost Loan agreement will be entered into with all acceptable solutions for OT&E of F-16 ARC-210 SATCOM Antenna.  The tail fairing of the F-16 is presently the most logical placement for an internal SATCOM antenna, alternate locations will be acceptable.  AATC has an available  tail fairing for measurement or possible modification allowing for an internal SATCOM antenna.  A COTS SATCOM antenna will then be placed inside the fairing by the respective antenna company.  Proposals for either modification of existing tail fairings or  fabrication of a form fit replacement for the fairings will be acceptable.  Companies interested in this effort will be required to have an agreement with Rockwell Collins, the supplier of the ARC-210 radio, for exchange of proprietary information.  In ad dition, prior to the modification of any tail fairing, flight clearance authorization must be approved by the F-16 SPO.  Possible follow on procurement and production phases and funding are dependent on Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE) results. The government is looking for a system that offers best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost; however, affordability is the most important factor.  The following information is provided to assist in conducting a Request for Information/Sources Sought synopsis by identifying potential contractors who have the COT solution, skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort.     SATCOM Antenna Requirements: Tail fairing capable of all F-16 operating conditions and limitations; 240 to 380 MHz for SATCOM; 125 watts minimum with 200 watts maximum. Possible Additional Requirements: 400 to 450 MHz for possible simultaneous EPLRS radio use; 30 to 512 MHz for possible ARC-210 LOS use. Interested parties capable of providing these antennas and fairings, which meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system and a des cription of system capabilities.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as r elated to the technical effort requested above.  A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses. Responses should be received by close of business 30 February 2007.  Tail fairings will then be sent out to those acceptable companies providing nece ssary documentation.  Testing will determine the most effective system.   Please e-mail all Infor mation and SOC to the Contracting Officer, Michael DeSouto, at Michael.desouto@aztucs.ang.af.mil.  For programmatic questions or technical questions contact LTC Leonard Dick at (520) 295-6930.  The Rockwell Collins POC is Don Horton, (319) 295-4635. This s ynopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this synopsis.

Any information regarding that future acquisition will be outside of the KSC Institutional Base Support Restructure (IBSR) strategy. All additional information will continue to be provided at http://ibsr.ksc.nasa.gov No solicitation or additional information exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

The minutes of the meeting will be made available to all interested parties.  All expenses for attending this meeting shall be the responsibility of the attending organization or individual.

<DESC>1.       Amendment 0001 is hereby incorporated into Request for Quote (RFQ) numberW912JF-07-T-0004 and shall become a part of any resultant contract. 2.       The following is a response to contractor submitted questions: Question: The pictures we see show no corrosion protection (i.e. primer or paint).  Is this the final product we see in the pictures and does the solicitation require any corrosion treatment on the metal?  Answer: No paint or other corrosion protection required. Question: There is no drawing or any pictures showing a particular placement for the handles requested on Line Item 0001.  Is there any information to clarify this item and information to give us a size, material and placement?  The solicitation document s only give us which side of the plates to install the handles on. Answer: Attached to inside of plate to allow for moving and emplacement. Question: On Line Items 0002 and 0003, are the brackets welded to the plates?  At what dimension from the edge and bottom?  Is the 32 edge of the bracket welded to the plate? Answer: Up to contractor as long as plates can be fit together and connected securely. Question: On Line Item 0001, after laying out the dimensions given for the new larger front plate (as compared to the smaller unit in the pictures) the new dimensions do not give the same shape plate as the pictures.  Using 73 for the base of the front pl ate, 33 for the height of the front plate and 48 for the angled edge of the front plate yields an almost closed pyramid once the side plates are attached.  Are we misinterpreting the dimensions?  We would assume that the new larger Line Item 0001 is just  a larger version of the smaller one in the pictures.  If so, we cannot get the listed dimensions to yield that result. Answer: Correct it will resemble the one in the picture. As far as specific measurements that will have to be done by the contractor, as long at it is large enough to fit the target mechanism and allow them to operate correctly. 3.       The closing date for submission of offers will remain as February 22, 2007 at 10:00 AM CST.

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add the Performance Statement of Work here at the top of the document.  The combined synopsis solicitation follows below.

Performance Work Statement - entitled ' Quarterly Mass Spectral Assessment Services ', dated January 18, 2007

TASKS : 
The contractor shall perform evaluation of the quality of Electron Ionization (EI) mass spectral data, and of the compound ID information attached to the spectra (such as the Main name, and synonyms) for the inclusion in the commercially distributed NIST/NIH/EPA Mass Spectral Library (The Library) (http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1.htm). For the assessment of mass spectra a contractor shall use structure of a compound to determine that the spectrum is logical for a given structure by analyzing probable losses from molecular ions and well established rearrangements of ions in the gas phase, as defined by NIST in the document ?The critical evaluation of a comprehensive mass spectral library?, published in the Journal American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 1999, vol. 10, p, 287-299. In addition a contractor shall compare the spectra to the previously identified high quality spectra of similar compounds, such as, homologs, analogs, and derivatives. The assessment of the quality shall include the selection of the best from the choice of multiple spectra for a compound.

The assessment of the names/synonyms attached to the spectra shall include examination of the main name and of all the synonyms attached to the spectra. The name should be consistent with the structure and reflect stereochemistry. The evaluation of names/synonyms shall include the selection of the main name that will appear with the spectrum in the Library. The main name should be the most commonly used ?trade? name when available. The IUPAC name shall be the main name when trade names are not available for a given compound.

The Contractor must provide to NIST the justifications electronically (in electronic ? to be removed) (Microsoft Word) of any recommended changes to be made to the spectra  and the chemical structures (when changes are suggested) in an electronically readable format (mol. Files,
 http://www.chemaxon.com/marvin/doc/user/mol-csmol-doc.html).

ACCEPTANCE TESTING-SURVEILLANCE : 
NIST shall perform acceptance testing of spectra delivered by the contractor by random sampling. NIST shall examine the spectra, compound ID information attached to the spectra, and experimental conditions according to the guidelines defined by NIST in the document ?The critical evaluation of a comprehensive mass spectral library?, published in the Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 1999, vol. 10, p, 287-299. The criteria for acceptance shall be that no more than 3% of spectra submitted to NIST are found to be in need of editing of any kind.

Two types of errors will be focused on during the acceptance testing:

When good spectra (or names) are deleted, it is possible that there are genuine differences of opinion by scientists. It is also possible that the contractor will reject too much in order to be safe. If the rejection rate is significantly higher than NIST deems to be reasonable, NIST reserves the right to reject the batch and completely withhold payment. If the contractor does not reject clearly bad spectra (or names), which NIST determines in its random sampling, then the contractor shall reprocess the entire batch at no additional cost to NIST.

NIST will randomly sample the result of each batch; rejection, if it occurs, will be by batch. Detailed discussion of why the batch was rejected will be sent to the contractor. If random sampling indicates a problem, NIST will examine the batch more closely. If the close inspection reveals a pattern of errors (for example, secondary and tertiary amines or alcohols are all incorrectly handled), NIST reserves the right to recall spectra of similar molecules from all previous batches, and the contractor shall reevaluate the spectra (or names/synonyms) at no additional cost to NIST.  

KEY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS:
Key personnel shall have a degree in chemistry or physics, at least 5 years experience with obtaining EI mass spectra and interpreting the spectral data, and at least one year experience in evaluating data in a mass spectral library.

SCHEDULE OF DELIVERABLES:
Schedule for delivery: No later than 120 calendar days after receipt of mass spectra from the NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC) (to be named at award.)

The contractor shall provide to NIST 
1.	An electronic copy of the assessments of the spectra (names/synonyms) in the ?NIST users library? format. 
2.	An electronic copy of the justifications of any recommended changes to be made to the spectra (or names/synonyms) in a ?Word? format.

<SUBJECT>54 -- Military Working Dog Deployment Kennel with Run

<DESC>This amendment is issued to respond to additional questions submitted by a contractor.

Question:  The industry convention for measurement is length by width by height.  Going by the information provided in the amendment would make the kennel 12 feet high. We assume that is incorrect and the measurements are 12L x 6W x 6H. Please clarify.

Response:  The kennel shall be approximately 48"W X52"H X 74?L - The run area that attaches to it once put together shall be at least 12'L X 4'W X 6'H.  The run hardware all fits inside the kennel for deployment purposes.  This requirement of storing the run inside the kennel for movement is a strict requirement for deployment purposes.  The kennel run is 6' high is a correct statement.

Question:  The note at the bottom is difficult to understand. A one piece kennel cannot slide because it is one piece. Please clarify. 

Response:  This should be a one piece kennel and no component slides in any way on this kennel.  The dog kennel should attach to the dog run.

Question:  Are drawings available for review?

Response:  No.  The Government does not have any drawings.

Question:  Solid wall panels on four sides may not allow for adequate ventilation. DOD veterinary command has required jail bar style on our latest kennels for ventilation and elimination of sharp edges. Are solid walls required on all four sides?

Response:  The stated specification requires high denisity polyester sides on the kennel runs for the dog's safety.  The other reason is to block the dog from the outside world, helping to keep them calm.  The front and back are ventilated.  Vendors must understand this is for the dog run area, not the kennel itself.  There is no such requirement for jail style bars on kennel runs.

<CONTACT>Julie Metzger, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-6243, Fax 717 770-7591, Email julie.metzger@dla.mil
<DESC>1.	 Amendment 0001 is hereby incorporated into Request for Proposal (RFP) number SP3100-07-R-0008 and shall become a part of any resultant contract.

2.	The following is a response to contractor submitted questions:
Question:  The description states that ?Part 1 of 2? as wood decking, 180 inches long x 96 inches wide and ?Part 2 of 2? as Wood Crate, 180 inches long x 100 inches wide x 101 inches deep.  A) are you expecting 60 separate Wood Decks & 60 separate Wood Crates (complete with a wood deck), or B) are these two parts (1 & 2) in-cahoots with each other and will be used together?
Answer:  "B", it takes one deck and one crate to make one configuration.  Consequently, we need a total of 60 configurations.
Question:  MIL-DTL-55507F specifies Rubbing Strips as 4x4 Lumber where MIL-C-3774B stipulates 2x4 Rubbing Strips.  Is there any specific stipulation that is required?
Answer:  Nail 2 2x6's together to form the Rubbing Strips (shoes as we call them).  Use the spacing as indicated on the drawing to make room for fork holes.  Fork holes are off center because the weight is off center.  Refer to drawing.
Question:  Due to the short Lead time, I was wondering if there was any ?Specific? markings as mentioned in MIL-STD-129 that is mandatory?  The lumber will have the appropriate Heat Treatment & EU stamps affixed as well as the stipulated markings in MIL-DTL-55507F.
Answer:  Heat Treatment and EU stamps are adequate.
Question:  These crates should be capable of carrying the MAX load of 16,000 lbs.  This assumption incorporates the heaviest lumber and maximum strength (concerning the number & size of bolts, nails, etc.).  There are stipulations in the Mil-Spec if the container max weight is 10,000 lbs or less. (If the absolutely max weight that these crates will carry will definitely be below 10,000, please let me know as this will reduce the cost somewhat significantly).
	Answer:  Use Type I classification, per MIL-C-3774B.
Question:  Shipment will constitute a Skid on the bottom, sides (2), ends (2), and one top all strapped together on top of the skid unitized as a set, one crate all together.  This is instead of stacking the sides together, stacking the ends together, stacking the tops together, and stacking the skids together. Please let me know if this is the preferred method of receiving these crates (as a set rather than as components). This assumption is dependent on question ?a? above.
	Answer:  Use most economical as long as everything arrives together.
Question:  These crates will have to be Fork-Truck accessible on both ends, therefore the deck should be reinforced accordingly (Please see MIL-C-3774B, paragraph 3.5.1.5 and refer to figure 16). ? I?ve gone with the 42? Fork Lift area design for both ends of the Skid Base.
Answer:  42" is okay, just do not forget the fork holes on the sides as mentioned in question #2 above.
	Question:  MIL-C-3774B mentions a 'connector plate".  Are these plates needed?

	Answer:  Connector plates are not needed.

3.  The closing date for submission of offers will remain as February 20, 2007 at 3:30 PM.
