<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on sole source basis to Mr. Gilbert Kaplan.  Kaplan will provide technical assistance with summarizing data on pesticide, microbiological and mycotoxin contamination of feeds obtained from FACTS as part of the Feed Contaminants Program.  

The Center for Veterinary Medicine’s (CVM) Office of Surveillance and Compliance is responsible for planning and coordinating many field activities, and particularly for the Feed Contaminants Program (FCP).  Mr. Kaplan is the only known source possessing the knowledge, insight and experience to perform these tasks because:  

1) Mr. Kaplan was responsible for these tasks when he was an employee of the CVM and has continued this responsibility as a contractor since his retirement; 

2) Mr. Kaplan has extensive knowledge and experience with the FCP, and has participated in CVM’s recent revision of that program; 

3) Mr. Kaplan has knowledge and experience with the FACTS database and the software used by the field to record the results of inspections, feed sampling, and laboratory analyses; and 

4) Mr. Kaplan has many years of experience in extracting the results from the FACTS database and evaluating the effectiveness of the compliance program, particularly with respect to pesticide, mycotoxin and microbiological contamination of animal feeds.  

Because of this experience and knowledge, Mr. Kaplan will need no training in ORA/CVM workplanning activities, in CVM’s feed compliance programs, or in how to extract compliance program results from the FACTS database to analyze the effectiveness of the Center’s FCP.  Thus, he will be able to perform the identified work in the short amount of time allotted for these tasks in the contract.

Mr. Kaplan will work closely with the Field Committee and Center Management to negotiate resource cuts should they become necessary.

His previous experience in this area will enable him to provide the Center with written and oral advice in an efficient and expedient manner within the short timeframe in which the assigned tasks must be accomplished.

Research will include materials testing of new conducting inks for reliable and low-cost printed interconnects and wires.  The contractor shall investigate novel approaches towards low cost, roll-compatible antenna materials, and on the design, fabrication and characterization of such antennas.  Using the design selected in Phase I, the contractor shall prototype RFID transceiver architectures that are resilient to high levels of interference while simultaneously providing a large signal dynamic range to accommodate longer distance EPC Class I Generation 2 decoding.  The contractor shall document the results as an appendix to the final report.  Contractor shall test the viability of FPGA logic elements developed in Phase I to provide both high dynamic range and high channel selectivity, as well as bit-recovery algorithms that can detect and decode tags in high noise environments.  The contractor shall investigate reader operating systems appropriate for device management and reader-to-reader communications link for the purposes of collaborative device management and self-orchestration in high density and ad-hoc mobile environments characteristic of military deployments.  Contractor shall develop a reader-to-reader communications link to allow RFID Tag information and reader system fault information to be shared among readers.  The contractor shall  investigate algorithms for collaborative fault-management among readers. The Contractor shall summarize all work accomplished under this SOW, including significant technical accomplishments, problems encountered, solutions implemented, and recommendations for improvement.  At the conclusion of the contract, the Contractor shall prepare a presentation that presents the results of these studies.  See Note 22.

First:  The Government believes that the current NAICS code of 811118, Other Automotive Mechanical and Electrical Repair and Maintenance, may not be the NAICS code that best represents the complete scope of work to be performed.  The Government is planning to change the NAICS code to 561210, Facilities Support Services, because this NAICS code better represents the complete scope of work to be performed.  
Second:  The current contract was awarded through full and open competition procedures and was not set-aside for small business.  The Government would like to consider some kind of small business set-aside for the new acquisition and is interested to see what small business respondents are interested in this acquisition.  
Third:  One of the provisions of the current contract is for the Government to provide vehicles as Government Furnished Material (GFM) for taxi support, base support, cargo services, wrecker services, shuttle bus services, vehicle control function, fleet analysis, VIP support services, travel license support, Staff Assistant Visits (SAV), renting and leasing of vehicles, and management of over 200 vehicles in the GSA lease program.  The Government is anticipating changing this requirement so that the successful contractor will be required to furnish these approximately 70 vehicles.  In addition, the successful contractor will be required to replace contractor furnished vehicles as necessary to meet the serviceability requirement of the statement of work; therefore, it may be necessary for the successful contractor to replace vehicles more that once during the performance of the contract.  
Fourth:  The Government would like to utilize a 10 year period of performance for the follow-on contract but is not sure that industry will be able to have pricing information to account for costs (such as vehicles) during the latter years of the contract.  

Interested parties should provide a capabilities report, including past performance information, for the response to the second question and should provide a specific response to the remaining three questions as applicable.  This response should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Cynthia Cooper via email at cynthia.cooper@tinker.af.mil by close of business on 31 Mar 05.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).     We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.
Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release       August 06
Industry Day              September 06
RFP Release              October 06
Contract Award       May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.     RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.     The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:     Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.     Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.     All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).     This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).     Each simulator has no motion.     Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.     The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.     The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.     The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.     Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.     Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.     The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).     The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.     It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.     The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.       A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.     The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.     The courseware was developed using Authorware.     Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)     TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.     Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.     The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.     At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.     There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.     The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.     At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.     Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.     Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.     The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.     Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.     Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.     TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.     The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.     Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.     Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.     It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The Spanish Ministry of Defense intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on works related to developing a Public Access Network (PAN) for processing and storing NATO RESTRICTED (NR) and NATO UNCLASSIFIED (NU) information as well as allowing access to the public internet.

The main purpose of the project is to standardize and upgrade different Public Access (PA) LANs throughout the Allied Command Europe (ACE), in order to create an ACE-wide consistent baseline in the NR/NU domain space. The main project objective will be to extend the Automated Command and Control Information Systems (ACCIS) Core Capability to the Management Information Systems (MIS) Bi-Strategic (Bi-SC) PA domain (Project 2001/51S03024) at Life Cycle Cost (LCC)-Land Madrid, Spain.

In order to achieve these objectives, the project will provide the equipment and works to support the implementation of a NR/NU LAN in the CC-Land HQ Madrid and NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA) Sector Madrid. This will require the provision of equipment and works included in the following general categories:

- 2.1 Desktop workstations, laptops, and peripheral equipment;
- 2.2 Networking hardware and local cable and wiring support;
- 2.3 Servers to support, firewall, DBMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage, and WINDOWS 2003 infrastructure services;
- 2.4 Hardware/software to support security service requirements;
- 2.5 Contract support to install the system and, if necessary, to perform system transition works that may be required.

Project 2001/51S03024 is to be implemented by various host nations where the different ACE headquarters and facilities are located. Hence Spain is serving as the Host Nation for the part of the project falling under the scope of CC-LAND HQ Madrid and NCSA Sector Madrid, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The specific Host Nation body responsible for the implementation management is the Spanish NSIP Project Joint Office (NSIP PJO).

The estimated value of this project is 2.1 million EUR ($2.6 million USD).

The reference that will be used to identify the documents related to this project is ESP/NPJO/2001/51S03024-0/ICB-1. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-2006-ESP-NPJO-2001-51S03024-0-ICB-1.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Project 51S03024 intends to provide CC-Land HQ Madrid with a LAN infrastructure that makes possible to process and store NATO UNCLASSIFIED information as well as the required connectivity to the public internet. This network is referred to as the Public Access Network (PAN).

The infrastructure to be implemented under this project will be integrated by the following items and subsystems:

- A number of user workstations, laptops (for mobile users), and peripherals (black and white and color printers and scanners) for the Public Access Network (PAN) users;
- A server subnet. The servers in this subnet will provide the required services for the PAN user community: infrastructure services as well as mail, print, fax, file, database, http, antivirus, and EMS services;
- An entry-level storage area network;
- A security subsystem to protect the entire PAN network infrastructure (firewall);
- A subnet that will allow a secure and controlled access to the Internet for internal users (Web browsing and SMTP relay);
- A subnet to provide limited connectivity for limited access users;
- The required networking infrastructure for interconnecting all the elements described above;

The following is a summary of the pieces of equipment and services included in the project for the implementation of the Public Area Network (PAN) in the CC-Land HQ Madrid:

- General Purpose Server: 11
- Firewall (High Performance Server): 1

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified as potential sources from the NAMSA Source File, additional firms must be introduced by their National Delegations with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bids (IFIB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 28 July 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bids (IFIB) to those on the Bidders List: no later than 31 July 2006 

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: TBD

The Bidders will be allowed not less than 42 days to reply to the relevant IFIB. The bids to be received in response to the NAMSA IFIB mentioned above will be valid for a period of 120 days.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue an order under NAVAIR Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N000421-05-G-0001 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC), 600 Grumman Road West, Bethpage NY 11714, for engineering and technical services for continued development of a FORCEnet Capability at Makaha Ridge, Kauai.  The FORCEnet Capability was implemented as a laboratory, by NGSC under a previous NAVAIR contract, containing a simulated E-2C platform and a small Cyber Warfare Information Network (CWIN) theater.  The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate emerging technologies important to the Fleet and the E-2C community to include enhancing the E-2C’s capability as a Battle Management Command and Control platform, and as a communications hub and information server to high, medium, and low bandwidth users.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate this order on a sole source basis with NGSC.  NGSC is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the E-2 (E-2C/E-2D) Aircraft and Weapon system and as such is the only firm with the knowledge, experience and technical data necessary to fulfill these requirements.  This phase of the effort will focus primarily on the continued development of E-2 Open Architecture software, the integration and networking of additional sensors with the existing FORCEnet facility, and supporting demonstration activities. This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  See Note 22.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport has a requirement for Thermal Batteries for the ADCAP MK 48 Torpedo.  The ADCAP Thermal Battery is an internal component of the ADCAP torpedo and its design requires the use of an initiator to start the chemical reaction.  Such initiator is considered an Electrically Initiated Device (EID) that utilizes an electrical discharge to produce an explosive, pyrotechnic, or thermal output.  It is well known that torpedoes are made of subsystems that contain both fuel and explosives.  Therefore, it is required that the design of this thermal battery ensures protection against accidental ignition of the initiator or other torpedo subsystems containing fuel or explosives.  In addition, storage, handling, assembly, or transportation of this thermal battery needs to comply with explosives handling guidelines mandated by the department of defense.  Contractors shall submit a design plan that is in accordance with ADCAP Thermal Battery Requirement Specification 6300535, Drawing #6300534, MIL-I-23659, MIL-STD-2073-1C, MIL-STD-129P, MIL-STD-130M, MIL-I-45208 (recommended to be used as guidance), MIL-HDBK-454A (replaces MIL-STD-454), MIL-HDBK-1512 (replaces MIL-STD-1512), MIL-STD-464A (replaces MIL-STD-1385) and MS90363 (recommend it be used as a guidance).  Specifically the Thermal Battery shall produce an output voltage of 225-300 V dc at a constant load of 875 W for a continuous interval of 11 seconds, starting at 775 milliseconds after initiation.  Such initiation will occur as a result of discharging an external capacitor into an initiator.  The battery output voltage shall remain within the range of 225-300 V dc from 500 -775 milliseconds after initiation and thereafter shall remain within 225-300 V dc for a minimum of 11 seconds.  A list of requirements that shall be met during qualification will be provided in the RFP. .  The Drawings will not be exhibited on our web site.  You must be Joint Certification Program (JCP) registered to obtain the drawings.  Please email your request for drawings to Lori Rosario at rosariola@npt.nuwc.navy.mil citing RFP N66604-06-R-3337, Company name, address, cage code and JCP number.  The Joint Certification Program (JCP) established the eligibility of a U.S. or Canadian contractor to receive technical data governed by DoD Directive 5230.25.  This Directive sets forth policies, procedures and responsibilities for the withholding of unclassified technical data from public disclosure.  DoD Directive 5230.24, a companion directive, establishes the distribution marking system for DoD-controlled technical documents.  The U.S. / Canada Joint Certification Program is managed by the U.S. / Canada Joint Certification Office (JCO).  The JCO is located at the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (Tel. 800-352-3572) and online at www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.  The JCO receives and processes certification forms submitted by U.S. and Canadian contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing critical technology under the control of, or in the possession of DoD.  Additionally, Paragraph 3.2.5.7 and Figure 3, Hydrostatic Cycling Profile, of ADCAP Thermal Batteries Specification 6300535 makes reference to a confidential drawing 5759651.   In order to receive this drawing, contractors must have a Confidential security clearance.  Offerors will be required to submit a design plan along with a technical proposal that addresses both Technical Capabilities and Past Performance.  Technical Capabilities includes sufficient information concerning their experience in designing, testing and manufacturing thermal batteries, resources (experience personnel, equipment, testing capabilities, investment plans (if any)), and estimated lead time to manufacture a qualification lot.  Award will be based on Greatest Value to the Government  The resulting contract will require delivery 6 months after award of 30 batteries (15 preproduction and 15 qualification).  It is anticipated that the production buys will be approximately 1,000 units per year for the next 10 years.  It is anticipated any production buys will be procured by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

<SUBJECT>F--WATERSHED RESTORATION WORK AT REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK, CA
<SOLNBR>N8482060010
<ARCHDATE>07182007
<CONTACT>Kris Swofford Contracting Officer 4156638522230  kris_swofford@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is soliciting interested and qualified sources to perform watershed restoration (heavy equipment) work at Redwood National Park.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, materials and supervision as necessary to accomplish restoration projects that include removing roads, landings, and skid roads to reduce future erosion and restore natural landforms and watershed systems.  Most work is located in the Lost Man Creek watershed at Redwood National Park, approximately 3 miles north of the town of Orick, Humboldt County, CA. Work involves excavating road fill from stream channels, pulling back side-cast road fill, decompacting roads, retrieving and burying debris from logging and other activities (culverts, cable, concrete foundations, etc.), and restoring the natural configuration of the land (ridges, stream valleys and swales).  The finished surfaces of all areas disturbed by the equipment shall be left in a manner suitable for transplanting.  Reconstruction of failed sections of road is often necessary in order to access the road removal work sites.  The terrain in the area is steep, irregular, and vegetated with 25-50 year old second growth redwood forest.  The nature of the work will require equipment to be used on steep terrain and in difficult working conditions.  Equipment will be required to push fill material up steep inclines as well as shape and finish steep slopes.  This will require the equipment to traverse, move around, and sit on steep slopes while performing the work.  Access to some work sites, or portions of work sites, will require operator skill and dexterity to minimize access impacts over steep irregular ground.  The size of excavations associated with this work can range from less than one hundred cubic yards to several thousand cubic yards in volume.  Heavy equipment work will be limited to 50-55 hours per week requiring at least two days off in any two week period.  Hours of operation will only be permitted between sunrise and sunset.  It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded for this work effort that will include a base year plus options to extend up to three additional years.  The estimated range for projects to be awarded is $25,000 (minimum) to $750,000 (maximum) each year.  Projects will be implemented through the issuance of individual task orders.  Due to critical habitat and endangered species concerns and restrictions within the work areas, project work is limited to a very short window that begins late summer (typically mid July) of each year and ends mid October each year.  (The first contract year project however, is expected not to start until September 16, 2006).  Award selection will be based on a Best Value determination made after considering costs and factors other than costs (experience, past performance, etc.) as set forth in the solicitation.  There is a likelihood that an award will be made to two or more of the most highly rated offerors.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available via electronic commerce only and can be accessed on/after August 2, 2006 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov or directly through the DOI National Business Center site at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after issuance.  The Contractor is responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFP.  This acquisition is unrestricted pursuant to Public Law 100-656.  Any/all responsible sources may submit a proposal which, if timely received, will be considered.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor materials and equipment to furnish and install a new sewage float at Ross Lake Boathouse per the plans and specifications.  Contractor shall construct a new sewage float, transport the float to Ross Lake for installation, demolish and salvage existing float appurtenances that will interfere with the installation of the new sewage float, install the new sewage float, and connect all structural, mechanical, and related systems between the existing and new floats. Schedule Depending on availability of funds, NPS expects to award this project in September or October and work can begin immediately after award of the contract.  NPS anticipates that the contractor would be able to work on-site by May, 2007.  We anticipate completion by August, 2007. Background and Location North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA) and Seattle City Light (SCL) jointly own, use, and occupy the Ross Lake Boathouse, which is on Ross Reservoir attached to Seattle City Light's Ross Dam.  Ross Lake Boathouse was constructed by SCL in 1995.  The floats for the boathouse are made of foam-filled concrete pontoons.  The boathouse is attached to Ross Dam by a fixed rail that allows it to move vertically as the lake level fluctuates.  Ross Lake regularly fluctuates 120 feet in elevation throughout the year.  The lake is usually within ten feet of full pool between early June and the end of September, although that changes from year to year.  In 2003, NPS became aware that at least one of the sewage holding tanks leak and that all of them are deforming as the level of fluid changes within the tanks.   This facility is not readily accessible via public road.  The reservoir can usually be reached at the north end by a gravel road into the U.S.A. from Hope, Canada, from mid-May to October.  Lake elevations vary through the season, however, and at low lake levels in spring, it is impossible to launch on the north end of the lake.  At the south end a foot trail provides access to Ross Dam and Ross Lake Boathouse.  Also at the south end of Ross Lake, Seattle City Light operates a barge on Diablo Lake that could transport materials and equipment to the Ross Dam haul road.  SCL may be willing to provide barge service to a contractor working on the Ross Lake Boathouse. Cellular phones do not work at the project site.  Information and maps are available at www.nps.gov/noca . Solicitation Details This action is a best value procurement open to all sources.  The NAICS code is 237110 and the small business size standard is $31.0 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $25,000 and $100,000.  The full solicitation will be posted electronically to http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about July 26, 2006.  Offers will be due on August 24, 2006.  Prior to award of a contract, the offeror must maintain a current profile in the Central Contractor Registration database (www.ccr.gov); complete the online representations and certifications (www.bpn.gov/orca); and file annual required veterans' employment reports (http://vets100.cudenver.edu/).  It is recommended that offerors complete these tasks prior to submitting their offer.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>This amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation QS-LOC-LSC20060013 is issued to permit the incorporation of the Statement of Work and Proposal Requirements for preparation of offers.

Potential offerors may submit one comprehensive set of questions/requests for clarification not later than 26 July 2006; with the exception of questions involving proprietary/trade secret information, the Library will provide one comprehensive summary of all questions received and our responses on or about 28 July 2006 (depending on the number and complexity of the queries submitted).

Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation may be transmitted on or before the closing date either electronically (in Rich Text or Microsoft Word/Excel format, pre-scanned for virus contamination) to cbar@loc.gov, or by facsimile, to (202) 707-8611.


SYNOPSIS:
The Serial and Government Publications Division (SER) of the Library of Congress houses approximately 55,000 serial titles, primarily in Roman alphabet languages.  A major preservation function of the Division is to prepare serial issues for binding on a regular basis.  After the serials are assembled into bindable units, the bindable unit is barcoded, and the Library of Congress integrated library system (LC-ILS) is updated to uniquely  identify the new serial volume and to indicate its status and future location in the Library (inventory control).

This contract will be for binding preparation of approximately 3,000 serial titles and serials inventory control of approximately 25,000-27,000 bindable serial units.  It will be a firm fixed unit price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the specified services. The contract will be awarded to the offeror whose combination of technical and price proposals represents the best value to the government within the available Library of Congress resources.  Work will be performed in the work areas of the Serial and Government Publications Division, Madison Building, Library of Congress.  It will require a permanent, full-time on-site project manager and three to four technicians.

Binding preparation consists of retrieving loose issues from the SER serials stacks, assembling and collating them into proper order, preparing binding instructions for the binder on LARS  binding preparation software, quality reviewing work, and delivering work to the Binding and Collections Care Division of the Library for shipment to the contract binder.  It further requires distinguishing binding styles, methods of leaf attachment, and types of cover cloth used by the Library of Congress, as well as understanding standard instructions that must be given the bindery based on pieces in hand.  Serials inventory control involves barcoding bindable units, creating or editing item records in the LC-ILS, creating or updating holdings records in the LC-ILS, and suppressing reference to the loose issues being bound in the Library’s online public access catalog. Item and holdings records are constructed according to national and Library of Congress standards.  Inventory work is done after a batch of bindable units is prepared and before it leaves SER.  The work requires working in cataloging, acquisitions, and OPAC modules of the LC-ILS, which is a Voyager product.

The Statement of Work will be posted as a separate supplement to this combined solicitation/synopsis.

The DAPIA monitoring tasks require the contractor to assist HUD in tasks required to evaluate the performance of design approval agencies and provide recommendations to HUD on related aspects of the program.  The SAA monitoring tasks are to assist HUD in monitoring and verifying that the 38 SAAs handling manufactured housing related consumer complaints for HUD are performing satisfactorily.  Miscellaneous support and auxiliary services will be detailed under principal task sections of the SOW.  These items include program-related assistance, alternative construction reviews, analysis of technical issues, accounting for fees, and label controls.
<br><br>
The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the size standard is $6.0 million. The period of performance will not exceed 66 months, including the Base Period and all Option Periods, if exercised.  
<br><br>
The RFP release date will be on or about August 3, 2006.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to Midway Enterprise, P.O. Box 13, Caliente, Nevada 89008-0013.  The purpose of this acquisition is to maintain and support the Federal Oversight Survey System (FOSS).  The FOSS system is the tool that the regions used to evaluate how the State Agency teams conduct their long-term survey.   The primary users of this product are the survey and certification surveyors in the regional offices.  The critical timeframes, the lack of internal coding knowledge, and the complicated software structure make it almost impossible to select and untrained and unfamiliar contractor.  Mr. Campbell is the recognized expert in the management collection, analysis, documentation and dissemination of FOSS data.  Mr. Greg Campbell is the principal in Midway Enterprise, and is the original developer of the FOSS; his specific expertise makes Midway Enterprise uniquely suited for the procurement.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>TITLE REPORT SERVICES

IRS requires certified title reports for private and commercial real property (e.g., Lot Book, Chain of Title, Grant Deeds, etc.) as recorded, in the fifty-eight California Counties.  IRS does not require and is prohibited from the purchase of Title Insurance, but will require certification that the data and history provided on any report(s) ordered is complete and accurate.  

Individual reports will be ordered as required, for delivery of the report specified to the IRS within 10 days.  IRS currently orders 600-800 reports annually from Title Insurance providers within California.  A Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) Award will be made to the contractor, or contractors, who demonstrate their ability to provide the required reports, at prices deemed to offer the best overall value to the Government.   Administratively, IRS desires the minimum number of providers that ensure coverage for all California counties; therefore multiple best-value awards may result, if a single contractor cannot provide full coverage at prices evaluated to offer the best overall value.

This is an unrestricted, full and open requirement for commercially available title services and will be procured under the test program for certain commercial items (FAR sub-part 13.5) for one base year and two option periods.  The NAICS code is 541191.     All responsible business concerns are encouraged to submit a proposal(s).   Interested providers should contact the Contracting Officer for a copy of the request for quotation, which will be available on or after August 7, 2006.  NO telephone requests for the RFQ will be honored.   Requests may be faxed to 415-848-4711 or e-mailed to jim.gensler@irs.gov.   Requests should include the name of the company, address, point of contact: name, telephone number and e-mail address, and the DUNS number.  NOTE:   Awards can only be issued to a contractor with an active registration in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov.     This registration must be active no later than the due date of the quotes to be eligible for award.     For registration assistance, please call 1-888-227-2423.  See Numbered Note 25.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>MAST Pre-Proposal Conference: New realities demand innovative concepts to focus the talent of industry and academia on critical technology needs of the Army.  The strategy employed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) focuses in-house laboratory research on Army-specific business  areas while establishing extramural centers of research in areas where state-of-the-art expertise could be leveraged to satisfy Army technology needs.  One of the models created to facilitate this, ARLs Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), has been s uccessful in developing science and transitioning technology using the paradigm of collaborative work involving government, industry, and academia.  As a result, the Army now desires to establish a new CTA, the Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology (MAST ) CTA. The objective of the MAST CTA is to perform enabling research and transition technology to enhance tactical situational awareness in urban and complex terrain by enabling the autonomous operation of a collaborative ensemble of multifunctional, mobile micro systems.  To achieve this objective the Alliance is expected to advance fundamental science and technology in several key areas including small-scale aeromechanics and ambulation; propulsion; sensing, processing, and communications; navigation and control;  microdevices and integration; platform packaging; and systems architectures. The MAST CTA consists of two components:  (1) the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) the Technology Transition Component.  The Fundamental Research Component will provide for research, the results of which will be in the public domain.  A fundamental research program is sought in four research areas.  The first three research areas are focused on Microsystems Mechanics, Processing for Autonomous Operation, and Microelectronics.  These research areas will be conducted in academic institutions hereinafte r referred to as Centers.  The fourth research area, Integration, is focused on system analysis, modeling and experimentation research, and other integration issues and is expected, but not required, to be conducted by an industrial concern.  The performan ce of collaborative (involving government, industrial and academic concerns) research is expected to result in integrated results and solutions in MAST.  The Technology Transition Component will provide for the application of the fundamental research resul ts to military and other Government applications. A DRAFT Program Announcement (PA) is being issued that will result in the award of two instruments for the MAST CTA:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of a Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement cont ract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of a Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium consisting of four Principal Members coinciding with the four resear ch areas set forth above.  This Consortium may also include General Members as necessary and appropriate to fulfill the goals of the MAST CTA Program.  The Principal Member for Integration is expected (but not required to be) an industrial concern, and wil l also be considered the Lead of the Consortium.  The Principal Members associated with the research Centers for Microsystems Mechanics, Processing for Autonomous Operation and Microelectronics must be academic concerns. Under the PA, proposals are sought to select the four Principal Members for the MAST CTA.  Proposals must address only one of the four research areas described above.  Should an offeror desire to propose under more than one of the research areas, a complet e separate proposal must be submitted for each area.  A critical element in deploying microsystem technology is the interplay between individual technologies.  Responses to the PA should consider crosscutting themes carefully.  Radical design and engineeri ng methodol ogies are envisioned in which system-level performance is emphasized over the optimization of individual functions.  The Government will make award to the Consortium (consisting of the four Principal Members selected for award, and any General Members incl uded in their proposals) that offers the best value to the Government, conforming to the PA, cost and other factors considered. The projected scope of the MAST CTA Fundamental Research Component is approximately $50 million over the first five years and $50 million for a five-year option.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the Lead of the Consortium.  Individual tasks wil l be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities and funding for such are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.  Exercise of the five-year option (for both the cooperative agreement and the procurement contract) will be based on a comprehensive review of technical performance, the availability of funds and Army needs. A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on Tuesday, 15 August, at 9:00 am local time, in the Washington DC/Baltimore, MD area.  Details concerning the Conference (pre-registration is required to attend) are available through the MAST CTA website at www.arl. army.mil/MASTCTA.  The MAST CTA website is expected to be accessible beginning on or about 19 July 2006.  Information presented at the Conference will be made available for those who would like to have a copy of this information and for those who are unabl e to attend. Technical Point of Contact is Joesph Mait at Area Code 301-394-2462.

8.  88 CONS H-002 - Delivery Procedures Commercial Vehicles
All vehicles larger than a large pick-up truck are required to be inspected by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Commercial Vehicle Delivery Gate (CVDG) prior to entering the installation.  Vehicles to be inspected include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses 
6.  Garbage/recycled waste trucks
7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 002:  

The Special Operations Systems Group (SOFSG), Battlefield Airmen Flight (BA) seeks to acquire and field a Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit’s need for real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach as technology matures and funding becomes available through the POM cycle.  The objective for Block 0 is for the delivery of specification compliant systems IAW the contract delivery schedule, delivery of the required data items and products, and execution of the associated program support.  At a minimum, the system shall meet the BATMAV initial screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and Airworthiness Requirements.  The objective for further blocks is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology insertion.

SOFSG plans to issue formal RFP Number FA8629-06-R-2351 for a small business set-aside for the BATMAV system on or about 21 July 2006, with proposals due on or about 20 August 2006.  The Government anticipates the current requirement for BATMAV will be approximately 221 systems for the primary customer.  (30 in FY07, 75 in FY08, and 116 in FY09).  However, the contract is being structured on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity basis, so that other interested customers can also use this vehicle to purchase the system.  

The initial delivery order will include the necessary integration effort for the Block 0 system (FY06 funding).  Options for production, training and sustainment will also be placed on the initial delivery order for execution after production and operations funds become available in FY07.  Thirty (30) systems are required for the initial delivery order.  

The proposed system shall consist of the following basic components: 
Ground Control Station (GCS) (1 per system);
Air Vehicle (AV)(2 per system) – hand launched;
AV Payload;
Field Repair Kit 

A preliminary budgetary estimate for development and production funding is located in Section L of the Request for Proposal package, which has been posted online at FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov.  This budgetary information is for planning purposes only and is not contractual.

Draft copies of the Statement of Objectives, Systems Requirements Document, and System Demonstration are currently posted online at FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov for review and comment.  Other documentation, including a copy of the model contract will be posted as it becomes available.  A copy of the formal RFP Number FA8629-06-R-2351 may be accessed via the internet on or about 21 July 2006 on FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov   All questions and comments must be submitted electronically to Ms. Nancy Leggett, Battlefield Airmen Contracting Officer at Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334511   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Technical Question & Answers  (Amendment #1) Question #1:   Regarding the camera system.  Is it acceptable to propose a digital stills camera?  If so, what signal will activate the camera?  Is a strobe required? Answer #1:   It is  acceptable to submit a quote with two options, one for a video camera and one for a digital still camera.  As for the activation of the camera, it preferred that it be triggered by an altimeter (or what is used to define height off the bottom, to a user defined altitude or distance from the bottom)  with a user determined frame rate.  As for the strobe, the strobe is required for the digital still camera, but not for the video. However, the video camera should have some type of lighting system. Question #2:  Regarding navigation, there is a middle of the road option utilizing a DVL that  provides excellent navigation accuracy vs. dead-reckoning, but without the cost of a full inertial navigation system. Is this acceptable to meet the EPA's specification for this requirement? Answer #2:   The middle of the road option is acceptable in relation to the EPA's specifications, but if  different options for navigation are available that meet the EPA's specifications and are quoted, that is also acceptable.       This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice.  The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00125.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.

<SUBJECT>A--MODELING OF THE OXIDATION OF MERCURY IN A PILOT-SCALE COMBUSTER
<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-06-00172
<RESPDATE>072406
<ARCHDATE>08242006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Amendment #1 Technical Questions and Answers 1.  Section 2 of Approach refers to the "Contractor's existing kinetic model".  Is that model available for review prior to submission of a quote? Answer:  There are several companies that have already done extensive work  looking into the mechanisms of mercury oxidation.   These companies have either prepared their own models or modified other company's models.  These models have been discussed in scientific literature as well as at technical conferences.  It is assumed that any contractor interested in this  requirement would have its own kinetic model, or be able to purchase and modify an existing kinetic model.   2. This requirement implies that this is a continuation of a previous effort.  Is this correct? Answer:  There have been several manuscripts in the scientific literature on  modelling the oxidation of mercury in coal flue gas.  The EPA would like to apply one of these models to data that is being collected on a pilot scale combustor.  This is not a continuation of a previous effort,  but rather applying an existing model to our results. 3.  Task 3 and Task 4 state  that "at least one" paper/manuscript will be produced.  If you anticipate more than one, what number should be used in the quote? Answer:  Please identify in your quote, only one paper/manuscript being produced. 4.  Task 4 states that the contractor may be responsible for presenting a paper at a  conference.  Should this cost be included in the quote or will it be handled as a "Change" if it is required?  If it is to be included, what destination should be used?  If a location has not been determined, shouldn't all offerors be instructed to use the same destination in order to have  comparable quotes?  Answer: The cost of travelling to a technical conference and presenting a paper at that conference shall be included in the quote.  The conference at which this information shall be presented at has not been determined.  Two potential technical conferences have been specified in  the Statement of Work as acceptable, one is the Air and Waste Management's annual conference and the other is the EPRI/AWMA/EPA Mega-Symposium.  It will be a domestic conference in which travel costs are fairly similar for large cities in the United States. Modeling of the Oxidation of Mercury in  a Pilot-Scale Combustor This is a request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00172.  The RFQ and incorporated  provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees.   STATEMENT OF WORK Period of Performance:  12 Months from the date of award  Estimated Level of Effort:   The level of effort for this project is estimated to be 250 hours. Goal  The goal of the proposed project is to perform and validate a definitive kinetic study of mercury oxidation  mechanisms that characterizes the impact of flue gas temperature gradients and heterogeneous reaction mechanisms on the extent of high temperature mercury oxidation.  The proposed work would further EPA's mission as follows: "The work would serve to explain the variability in mercury emissions  often observed and documented under EPA's Information Collection Request and will provide a foundation for the extension of studies now being conducted to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. "The work would validate an established kinetic model for mercury speciation, which would be a  valuable national resource as utility and industrial coal-fired boilers implement technology to meet mercury regulations through a wide range of national coal supply.  The emphasis on gas quenching rates and supplemental unburned carbon will fill an important gap in the current understanding of  mercury oxidation mechanisms. "Results would be published in a peer reviewed journal and at technical conferences to add to the national knowledge base on mercury and to disseminate the results to a wide audience. Approach  1. Areas of interest and parameters to be modeled include the following  model runs: "Flue gas economizer inlet and outlet temperature variation. "Flue gas temperature gradient (within economizer) variation. "Coal type variation (subbituminous and bituminous). "Coal chlorine and mercury content variation. "Fly ash carbon level variation. 2.  Model simulations will be  performed using Contractor's existing kinetic model for mercury speciation. "Obtain parametric predictions for oxidized mercury entering and leaving all units in the gas cleaning system based on: variation in flue gas temperature entering and exiting heat exchanger. FLue gas quenching rate  variation. Fly ash unburned carbon level variation.  Coal rank and chlorine content variation. "Model simulations will be used to generate kinetic curves, as follows: Extent of mercury oxidation vs. flue gas quench rate Extent of mercury oxidation vs. economizer inlet temperature Extent of mercury  oxidation vs. economizer outlet temperature Extent of mercury oxidation vs. unburned carbon level Extent of mercury oxidation vs. coal rank/chlorine content 3.  Data reduction, reporting and publication of results Task 1: Modeling Scope Definition EPA Laboratory Responsibilities: 1.  Laboratory  personnel will provide data from experimental work on the Multi-Pollutant Control Research Facility (MPCRF) to set up the kinetic model.  The data shall consist of: flue gas flow rates and temperatures firing rates for the MPCRF combustor typical coal analyses for subituminous and bituminous coals  to be tested flue gas compositions for each coal (O2, CO, NOx, CO2, SO2). system configuration and unit specifications sufficient to estimate inlet and outlet temperatures and residence times for each gas cleaning unit. Contractor Tasks: 1.  The Contractor shall lay out the kinetic modeling  framework. 2.  The Contractor shall estimate flue gas temperature histories and residence times for subituminous and bituminous coal base cases. 3. The Contractor shall refine the parametric modeling runs to be performed.  The kinetic simulations will be combinations of the following parameters,  plus any other items identified during Task 1.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO:
 .ISSUE A REVISED STATEMENT OF WORK DATED 7/18/2006, REVISIONS ARE MADE TO THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A PRIMARY SURVEY SENSOR
 .EXTEND THE DATE FOR RESPONSES TO THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION TO JULY 25, 2006


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey (OCS), has a requirement for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to perform rapid-response hydrographic-quality side scan sonar survey of port areas.  OCS requires an AUV that could be deployed in conjunction with manned surface assets to provide a rapid response capability for underwater domain awareness of ports, harbors, and inland waterways.  NOAA has a manned surface capability consisting of a 29-foot hydrographic survey launch equipped with multibeam and side scan sonar.  The survey launch is operated by a two or three person crew.  The operational concept is to use the AUV to augment the capability of the manned surface vessel to detect and map cubic features as small as 30 centimeters in water depths up to 100 meters.  The AUV would be deployed to perform baseline surveys, investigate targets in areas previously surveyed by the surface vessel or other resource, or survey potentially dangerous areas.  The autonomous vehicle will be operated by the crew of the survey launch with minimal or no shore-based support facilities.  The goals of using an AUV are, primarily, to provide standoff capabilities for the safety of the manned assets, and, secondarily, to increase survey efficiency and coverage.  

The technical requirements of AUV are detailed in the attached REVISED Statement of Work, Autonomous Hydrographic Survey Vehicle, dated JULY 18, 2006.  This requirement is set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334511 and the applicable size standard is 750 employees.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the qualified responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of this solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.    Award will be based on an integrated assessment of offers using all evaluation factors.  If an award is made, it will be to the responsible Contractor that offers the best value to the Government.  The evaluation factors, although relatively equal, are listed in order of importance:    
•	Approach – The likelihood of effectively meeting requirements
•	Past Performance – The relevance and quality of prior performance
•	Price – The amount, realism, and consistency of the evaluated price

An adjectival method will be used to rate each factor:
•	Outstanding – Clearly demonstrates the full scope of the requirement for a comprehensive system solution
•	Good – Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid
•	Adequate – Reasonably sufficient and suitable
•	Marginal – Minimally suitable at the lower limit
•	Unsatisfactory – Not sufficient, not enough, disappointing

Responses must be sent electronically in MS Word format to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov and in paper to Pauline Jaffe, Contract Specialist, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, Suite 7608, SSMC4, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, no later than 11:00 am, local time, on July 25, 2006.  The applicable terms and conditions for the resulting purchase order are current through FAC 2005-09 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Interested contractors are hereby advised that contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Please register with CCR at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov.  Questions regarding this requirement shall be submitted electronically to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  THIS MODIFICATION IS BEING ISSUED TO CLARIFY THE SOLICITATION NUMBER.  THE PROPER NUMBER IS WC133F06RP0187JAA.

The US Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to acquire services to collect data on the occurrence of right whales in nearshore continental shelf waters of the United States Mid-Atlantic coast.  The primary goal of this work is to identify migratory habitats and potential wintering ground for the right whale.  Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  The Agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  In the Mid-Atlantic States between North Carolina and New Jersey, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) share responsibility for overseeing and partially funding research on marine mammals, notably those populations listed as Strategic Stocks.  The population of right whales in the Western North Atlantic is highly endangered.  

The services under this contract are to be provided for the SEFSC in Miami, Florida.  The services include, but are not limited to:  1) Collection of data, utilizing aerial survey methods, of Northern right whales between North Carolina and Maryland. (As is possible, collect photographs for use in photo-identification of observed whales.); 2) Report positions of observed right whales to appropriate agencies (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, NEFSC Sightings Advisory System) to allow the broad cast of positions to mariners and thereby mitigate vessel strikes; and 3) Recommend to the Government, actions and activities to improve information on right whale habitat use in these areas and further mitigate collisions with vessels.

The Contractor shall provide all items necessary to perform the services described herein, which shall include but are not limited to: office facilities, supplies, equipment, hardware, software, and professional expertise, travel expenses, etc.

The period of performance will be October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government.  This acquisition is not set-aside for small business.  The NAICS code is 541990.   All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  For instructions on how to register in CCR and ORCA please access the following web site: http://www.bpn.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number.  A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at 800-333-0505. 

Firms interested in receiving notification when the Request For Proposal is available must submit a request in writing to the attention of Jane A. Allen via e-mail at jane.a.allen@noaa.gov or facsimile at 816-274-6936.   Reference must be made to the RFP number WC133F06RP0187JAA.

<DESC>The government intends to award on a sole source basis to Advance Training Systems (ATS), 4524 Highway 61, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55110 for the procurement and installation of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 35 PT-61B Target Systems, 3 T21B-2 (two targets) track mounted running man target systems, 6 high velocity 500 brinell ballistic steel plate barriers, 2wireless transmitters, 6 12V battery chargers, 1-AC electrical power distribution system for the MOUT facilities at three Installations. The installations are Dodge City Urban Sniper Range, MCB Camp Lejeune, NC, MCB Quantico, VA MOUT Facility, and the Urban Sniper Training Facility on Range 130, MCB Camp Pendleton, CA. The requirements include programmable target hit counting, pop-up, swivel, twist and or rotate from 0, 90 and 180 degree motion selection for target presentation and bi-directional target motion allowing two target images to be presented during a single target cycle to train 'shoot/no-shoot' scenarios.!   The systems must be portable and lightweight (less than 40 lbs), solar power capable with a rechargeable, long life battery that will allow maximum training time.  The systems must be capable of being integrated with other targets or operate as a stand-alone unit.  The target systems are required to have an automatic reset and hit count capability.  The target systems must be MILES compatible.  The rapid, multiple threats, progressive decision making capabilities of the system is ideal for the type of training that Marines are conducting in preparation for the global war on terrorism. The requested requirements are unique to the ATS PT 61B target system.  1. Dodge City, Camp Lejeune Urban Sniper Range Facility require 4 new PT-61B, reactive target system to be installed throughout the range behind various existing facades and in the hotel facility façade for the Dodge City Urban Sniper Range on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC.  The target system will consist of two (2) T21B-2 (two targets) track mounted running man target system with 40-foot I-beam track, and four (4) PT-61B bi-directional shoot-no-shoot targets.    The current facades are wooden structures with 2 windows and 2 doors.  The hotel facade is a two story building 20’ tall, 64’ wide, and 8’ deep with door and window openings.  It has a platform between floors 1 and 2 with stairs for access to the platform.  Different types of lighting placed preferably on poles are required in order to create, and or change the casting of shadows while shooting at night.    This project requires a total of 6 targets, 2 T21B-2 (two targets), track mounted running man target syst!  em with 40-foot I-beam track, to be placed behind designated facades; one will be placed on a concrete slab about 25 meters from the impact berm and four (4) PT-61B bi-directional shoot-no-shoot targets for doors and windows of the additional facades.   2. The MOUT Facility on Quantico requires a total of 25 ATS PT-61B Bi-directional targets for use with MILES gear. These targets will be placed in the MOUT windows, rooms and doorway to present shoot or no shoot scenarios.  The targets systems must be portable because they will be also used with the MOUT Assault Course (MAC), which is located near the MOUT Facility.  3.  The Range 130 Urban Sniper Training Facility on Camp Pendleton, CA requires a total of the following targets for a broader range of training to be conducted in the Range 130 Sniper Bay: 6 ATS PT-61B Bi-directional targets, 2wireless transmitters, 6 high velocity 500 brinell ballistic steel plate barriers, 6 12V battery chargers, 1-AC electrical power distribution system, 1-T21B-2 (two target), track mounted running man target system with 40 foot I-beam track, delivered.  This will afford SOTG the ability to accomplish and enhance the sniper training objectives available on the range.   4.  The Contractor shall furnish the necessary services, supplies, FOB Destination delivery to the range and travel required to perform, at Camp Lejeune, NC, Quantico, VA, and Camp Pendleton, CA, the installation of the Target Systems. The targets will be capable of working individually, in groups, in sequence or simultaneously.  The targets will be controlled from a single location with portable, wireless hand-held controllers. The total award, which is three separate projects, is worth approximately $203,000 with the anticipated delivery date of 45 days after contract award.   The system is listed under GSA Federal Contract Number GS 02F 0404D and under California Multiple Awards Schedule Contract Number 4-01069-0005A. This request is for all Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI).   The Marine Corps reserve the option to purchase additional target systems and supplies from Advanced Training Systems for sites aboard other Marine Corps Installation. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.

<DESC>SOURCE SOUGHT

The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center (USCG ELC) has a requirement to upgrade obsolete components of the Dynamic Positioning (DP) System installed onboard the USCG 225 WLB Class Cutters with an option to install the same DP components on the USCG 175 WLM Class Cutters.

Specifically the upgrade shall consist of components that replace the VME Digital Processor Assembly, and the Center Control Console while maintaining the Cutters American Bureau of Shipping DP Certification (ABS DPS Class 0). The remaining system components shall remain unchanged, and include the following: Cables, Interface to other systems, machinery, and sensors, Port and Starboard Control Stations, Vertical Reference Assembly, and Signal Processor Assembly.  The upgrade shall be a drop-in replacement into the existing panel cutout, and shall reuse all existing cables, and interface connections.  This requirement also requires an update to the technical manuals, a factory demonstration of the proposed replacement, a shipboard demonstration and test, a set of detailed installation and testing instructions, and a new software DP program installation package.

It is the belief of the Government that only the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), NAUTRONIX INC, Houston, TX and/or its authorized facilities can perform this upgrade without having to replace the entire system, cables, modify operator consoles, develop new logistics information, and develop new vessel dynamic and characteristic software models.  Therefore, it is the intent of the U.S. Coast Guard to handle this procurement as a sole source to the OEM, NAUTRONIX INCE as the Engineering Technical Data and Software Source Code are not available to the Government and are proprietary to the OEM.  Accordingly, it is the Government’s belief that the engineering and software information required to upgrade this system are proprietary.
However, other potential sources may submit information concerning their capability to provide a DP upgrade of the components herein; for the purpose of the USCG to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Government intents to award a Sole Source Contract to Carnegie Mellon University to aid the Office of Program Evaluation and Risk Analysis (OPERA) with a project entitled "Behavioral Modeling of Abusive Tax Scheme Participants."  This contract is seeking to expand the applicability of emerging simulation and analysis techniques for countering abusive tax schemes by building upon the agent-based simulation conducted in a recently completed phase of this project.  The new phase will conduct follow on research into experimentation and analysis to increase understanding of individual taxpayer behaviors and potential responses to IRS interventions.  It will also extend the stimulation within the model cities, expand efforts’ to increase scalability of the model and continue validation and verification activities.  In addition, we plan to begin outreach efforts to the IRS Business Unit’s leadership to increase the amount of subject matter expertise involved in developing this stimulation and analysis capability.  

There is a pressing need for improved decisions and policy analysis tools to reason about the impact different classes of interventions might have on the spread of various tax evasion or fraud schemes. Such tools have the potential to reduce the cost of the deployment of such interventions, increase their effectiveness, and provide better support to the tax-payer and the IRS.  Prior research by OPERA into agent based stimulation has developed a foundation of understanding about the high potential of this emerging technology, and has identified a set of open research questions that remain to be answered.

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR&#160;Subpart&#160;42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one&#160;business day's written notification of its intention to (A)&#160;change the name in the CCR database; (B)&#160;comply with the requirements of Subpart&#160;42.12; and (C)&#160;agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.  (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph&#160;(t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph&#160;(t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.  (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart&#160;32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.  (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

AMENDMENT: #2
This amendment changes #FA8604-06-R-7507 from sole source requirement to a small business set-aside for open competition.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is FA8604-06-R-7507.  This solicitation and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11, Effective 05 Jul 2006 and & Class Deviation 2005-o0001 and DFARS Current to Change Notice 20060616.  The solicitation incorporates by reference the following clauses: FAR 52.204-7, 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, and DFARS 252.204-7004 - Alternate A, 252.212-7001, 252.227-7013, and 252.227-7014.  NAICS Code: 423430.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The system will be to support a Unix computational environment.  The software will need to monitor 10,000 switch/router ports and collect and maintain a history of usage, state, and error statistics for each port.  Collection will need to be done over a low bandwidth link via the SNMP protocol.  The software must be able to handle different router and switch configurations, including manufacturer, type of switch, version of OS, and SNMP authentication strings.  No software can be loaded on the switches or routers.  The software requires the ability to sort the data by any collected statistic independent of the switch/router location. The software should also be able to export the data.  Access to the data must be via a web browser on a non-Microsoft machine via an SSL connection supporting the DoD CAC certificates as authentication. As a warning, Microsoft based solutions would be very difficult to support in the environment this will be utilized in.


EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS:

The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and are described below.  All factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important that cost or price. Supportability and Price are equally weighed; however, the product proposed must be determined to be technically acceptable. 

1.	Technical Capability
2.	Supportability
3.	Price


1. Technical Capability:  This will be evaluated by the ability to fulfill the above requirements.  Pass/Fail


2. Supportability: The below sub-factors will be evaluated to determine supportability of proposed product. 
   a. Administration requirements of the machine
   b. Hardware requirements needed to support it
   c. Amount of customization needed to obtain the functionality
   d. Impact of additional support platforms

These will be given a rating of Excellent, Satisfactory, and Unsatisfactory depending on definitions below
	 
Excellent (BLUE)       Response meets all and exceeds some of the specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Air Force and has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased price, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  
 	 
Satisfactory (GREEN)	Response meets all of the specified minimum performance or capability requirements and has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased price, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor effort and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  
 	 
Unacceptable (RED)	Response fails to meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance and is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased price or degradation of performance.  Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor effort and close Government monitoring.


3. Price: Reasonable

Please note if manufacturer requires a license agreement to be signed by government, the terms and conditions of that agreement are required to be in compliance with all Federal Laws, Statutes, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Therefore, please modify accordingly and submit with your quote.  

Delivery schedule is thirty (30) days after receipt of order.  Offeror must quote on all items or none.

FOB Destination.  The ship to address is Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7817.  Proposals shall be received at ASC/PKWIS, Attn:  Ryan Prickett, 2275 D Street., Bldg. 16, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433, or by facsimile at (937) 656-7469, or e-mail at ryan.prickett@wpafb.af.mil for receipt not later than 5:00 PM EST 25 July 2006.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-06-R-RS05.  QUESTION 1: The solicitation appears to seek only space qualified off-the-shelf solutions, with option to have a fourth unit employed for requalification, if the unit has not been qualified.  Does that exclude any ehanced development to existing products that may be worthwhile for follow-on potential, or is this current buy the only application anticipated?  ANSWER 1:  Units proposed by the Offeror are required to meet the minimum Government requirements as stated in the specifications for the solicitation. Offerors may propose a fourth wheel as an option, but only if required for production requalification if the Offeror-proposed units do not meet the solicitation specifications.  Follow-on purchases are not anticipated at this time.  QUESTION 2:  Does this solicitation reflect a follow-on buy to previous  Reaction Wheel purchases, and if so, can you provide a part number and previous purchase price of those Reaction Wheel purchases?  ANSWER 2: This solicitation does not reflect a follow-on buy.  QUESTION 3: The solicitation does not state what type of quote is being requested, although it seems to state a Firm Fixed Price based upon commercially available product.  Is any other bid pricing option being considered, (I.e. cost, plus fixed fee)?  Has the agency done a "Should Cost" assessment and is that information available to the bidders?  ANSWER 3: The Government contemplates award of a firm-fixed price contract. QUESTION 4: Does the agency expect all three (3) Reaction Wheels to be delivered in the 270-365 day schedule, or are we to understand that the first unit is to be delivered in that timeframe?  ANSWER 4: All required units must be delivered within the timeframe stated in the RFP.  QUESTION 5:  Will the agency accept any Reaction Wheel that exceeds, or is non-compliant with the stated specifications.  If so, what are the critical specifications that would severely impact any bid, and would it require that the product be modified to conform.  More specifically, how critical is the weight and size of the unit a factor in your selection? ANSWER 5:  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  QUESTION 6:  Is this solicitation a small-business set-aside?  ANSWER 6: No.
