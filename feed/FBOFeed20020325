<DESC>Title: Tactical Environmental Data Services \ Virtual Natural Environment Description: The Naval Meteorological and Oceanographic (MetOc) community provides relevant and timely data and information on the environment and its impact on operations.  In order to provide this information where needed the software development for a distributed environmental database and data distribution system and associated applications is required.  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) PMW 155, MetOc Systems Program Office, currently develops and maintains the Tactical Environmental Data Server (TEDS) as the primary component for environmental data and its distribution.  This new effort is intended to further expand upon the TEDS development and increase its applicability wherever environmental data is needed. SPAWAR anticipates issuing a solicitation for a base year with four one-year options.  This procurement is expected to result in a cost plus fixed fee award term contract. This contract will have a base year and four one year options. The Government shall determine whether to award the term period (ATP), keep the contract unchanged, or reduce the contract term in accordance with the award term plan.  We expect to release the final RFP on or about 15 May 2002, with proposals due 01 July 2002.  This will be a full and open competition. This distributed environmental database system must receive, catalog, store, and distribute data over existing wide-area network (WAN) (i.e. NIPRNET/SIPRNET/JWICS) architectures.  The data must be timely, accurate, and relevant with data assurance and data integrity requirements met.  The distributed architecture includes ability to subset only required amounts of data to the end- user as well as deliver timely and relevant data from end- users back into the distributed database.  The system will employ a combination of GOTS applications supported by a replicated and synchronized COTS database.  The current COTS database procured for the TEDS project is Informix. The requirement includes a unique blend of competencies to develop, test, deliver and install the necessary software to support PMW 155?s MetOc and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data management responsibilities. Development must occur on platforms and operating systems within the DII-COE for METOC systems to include, but not limited to HPUX 10.20 and 11.0, Solaris 2.6 and 8, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, and subsequent operating systems for similar platforms.  The developer must be experienced in cluster and profile aware applications and in the DII COE to produce segments and support them according to the GCCS-M and DII COE guidelines.  The major areas of performance include knowledge in METOC/GIS data types and methods, their storage and management, and METOC/GIS data libraries.  Interoperability with several affiliated government and commercial organizations is essential. The contractor must have experience with relational and object databases including, but not limited to, Informix. A demonstrated knowledge of techniques to serve data in specific formats, units and projections for both the tactical and non-tactical community is required.

Upon receipt of the "short-list" responses a final evaluation and selection of the most qualified firms for each proposed procurement will be made for EMN-2002-I-RII-LRG, proposals will be requested from up two of the highest ranked firms (or from four if no small businesses are found to be qualified under EMN-2002-I-RII-SBS) and cost negotiations will be conducted with each firm. If a mutually satisfactory contract can not be negotiated with any of those firms, negotiations will be terminated with those firms and the process will proceed to the next firm(s) until award is made for the desired number of contracts or all the "short listed" firms have been rejected. Responses shall reference either "Synopsis Number: EMN-2002-I-RII-LRG "ID/IQ Flood Studies for FEMA Region II" and EMF-2002-I-RII-SBS "ID/IQ Flood Studies for FEMA Region II" on the face of both the SF 254 and SF 255 for each procurement as well as the outside of the envelope.

However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement  may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of performing the work. This documentation must be provided to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Marsha Coffman, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-324-2457, Fax 202-324-3104, Email itca.finance@fbi.gov
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a fixed-price sole source indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract for a base period and four (4) additional one-year options with Defense Group Inc., (DGI) 2034 Eisenhower Avenue, Suite 115, Alexandria, VA 22314, to provide a minimum of 820 CoBRA  Response Kits and related technical support services to support the State/Local bomb squad mission to respond to incidents involving improvised explosive devices and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  It has been determined that DGI is the only source that fully meets the FBI's requirements for a portable incident management system. The FBI's minimum requirements for an incident management system are:  (i) a system that is commercially available, supported, and deployed (e.g., the FBI will not accept developmental items); (ii) a system that can be produced in sufficient quantity to support a major rollout (up to 200 units per month); (iii) a system with past performance that demonstrates an operational track record in support of large events through multi-agency use; (iv) a system that integrates standard bomb data reporting requirements; (v) a system that is capable of integrated wireless transmission of intelligence information, procedures, reports, and evidentiary information; (vi) a system that integrates scanning, printing, and digital camera functionality; (vii) a system that integrates GPS and mapping capabilities; (viii) a system that is man-portable (entire kit must meet OSHA one-man carry limits); (ix) a system that is ruggedized for field use; (x) a system that includes an optional laptop having an intrinsically safe rating; (xi) a system with a software configuration that is remotely modifiable through a centrally managed administrator toolset; (xii) a system that is based on software currently in use by the entire response community, including Fire, HAZMAT, Law Enforcement, Federal, Military, and Commercial First Responders; (xiii) a system that is built on open architecture industry standards for data interchange, including XML; (xiv) a system incorporating software that does not require network connectivity for access to all included response data; (xv) a system that provides time tag tracking of all actions within the software; (xvi) a system that includes pre-loaded response data, including a comprehensive set of searchable databases on industrial chemicals, chemical and biological agents, and response guides and checklists.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However all proposals received within forty five (45) calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. This is a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334 and the size standard is 500 employees. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  Due to national security and safety issues, the FBI's receipt of Bids and Proposals has been revised.  Bidders and Offerors are prohibited from delivery of Bids and Proposals to any FBI facility.  In addition, until further notice, the only acceptable means for submitting a Bid or Proposal will be through the United States Postal Service (USPS).  The Bidder or Offeror shall be responsible for ensuring that the Bid or Proposal is sent either by registered or certified mail post marked by a USPS via Hand Stamp clearly showing the date of receipt by the USPS and Post Marked not later than the due date for receipt of the Bid or Proposal.  Further, the Bidder or Offeror must also obtain a USPS Hand Stamp on a copy of the Bidder's or Offeror's submission letter.  This document must be transmitted to the FBI Contracting Officer identified within the solicitation document by facsimile  not later than the due date for the Bid or Proposal.  Any Bid or Proposal sent to the FBI without having transmitted the facsimile copy of the submission letter to the FBI Contracting Officer by the due date will be considered late.  The facsimile copy must be received by the respective Contracting Office no later than 4:30 p.m. on the due date for receipt of the Bid or Proposal.  The term "Postmark" means a printed stamp, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed on the date of mailing by employees of the United States Postal Service.  Therefore, Bidders or Offerors should request the postal clerk to place legible hand cancellation bull's-eye postmark on the envelope or wrapper, the submission letter and the receipt.  Bidders and Offerors are hereby notified that their Bids or Proposals will be received from the USPS at an FBI off-site location and that these Bids or Proposals may be opened for security/safety reasons and will be released and forwarded to the FBI Contracting Officer shown on the address label.  The FBI recommends that all Bids or Proposals be page numbered and stated in the submission letter as to how many pages are included in the Bid or Proposal.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis, negotiations will be conducted with DGI on a sole-source basis.  Solicitation documents are not available.

<DESC>NA The project involves providing protection at eight areas in Oregon along the interface of Columbia River with Interstate Highway 84 where wind caused wave action is causing bank erosion that threatens the highway.  Four sites are between Corbett and Rooste r Rock.  Two sites are east of Rooster Rock.  One just west and one just east of Multnomah Falls.  We may reduce the number of sites addressed to a lesser number of the most critical sites.  The PDA phase consists of all planning and design activities requ ired to demonstrate that Federal participation in a project is warranted, and completes all technical and regulatory activities necessary to approve the project and award the construction contract.  The sponsor of the project is the Oregon Department of Tr ansportation (ODOT).  ODOT has done some coordination with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regarding the needed bank protection work.  NMFS prefers that bioengineering solutions be applied to the erosion problem areas.  However, ODOT has determine d that true bioengineering based protection is not appropriate because of the erosive energies involved and the critical nature of the 1-84 Highway.  ODOT has looked at design concepts at the milepost (MP) 22.5 and 22.9 areas and have proposed riprap prote ction with plantings and woody debris incorporated into the stone/bedding with boulders or barbs placed at the base of the slope.  There is one area at Rooster Rock State Park that is sheltered from wave action where “true” bioengineering may be applied. Consideration will also be given to using other structural units for erosion protection such as articulated concrete mattresses, Reno mattress and gabions.   This procurement is unrestricted and open to both small and large businesses.  Magnitude of construction is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  Solicitation  No. DACW57-02-B-0005 will be issued on or about 21 May 2002 and bids opened on or about 21 June 2002.   Request for bids on-line at https:www.nwp.usace.army.mil.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mrs. Amina Benkhadra, Director General, Office National de Recherches et d?Exploitations Petrolieres (ONAREP), 34, Avenue Al Fadila, 10050 Rabat, Morocco, Telephone:  (212-37) 23-80-00/23-80-37/23-80-76, Fax:  (212-37) 28-16-26/28-16-34, Email:  benkhadra@onarep.com :

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a simulation feasibility study for the Toukimt and Meskala gas fields.

SERIOUS OFFERORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO VISIT ONAREP OFFICES (AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE) AND MEET WITH RELEVANT ONAREP STAFF BEFORE SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL.

The Office National de Recherches et d?Exploitations Petrolieres (ONAREP) is a public organization under the administrative supervision of Morocco?s Ministry of Energy and Mines, with a mandate of coordinating and managing all activities related to exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Morocco.  It explores for oil and natural gas in Morocco, and operates small onshore gas/condensate fields.  In addition, ONAREP is responsible for investment promotion in attracting foreign, including U.S. oil companies.  ONAREP negotiates the terms of reconnaissance (seismic) contracts and petroleum agreements, and applies jointly with its partners (foreign oil companies) for exploration and production licenses and permits.  It also maintains all available geophysical data and offers it to interested outside companies free of charge.

A simulation study for the Meskala and Toukimt gas fields is needed to minimize the excess water flow to the well bores, minimize the formation of condensate around the well bores, optimize production and recovery of gas condensate, and prepare a future development plan.  Based on performance data on the two fields, condensate had formed in the reservoir, reducing well production capacity.  One possible cause of the excessive water production experienced in some wells is water coning ? pulling a cone of water up into the well bottom by pressure difference between the water and the well bore.  

The objective of this study is to define a strategy to solve or mitigate the problems of production in the Toukimt and Meskala fields, and to adopt an optimal scenario of production, which will allow a precise evaluation of the final recovery of gas and condensate.  The study tasks are summarized as follows:  1) data gathering, review and analysis, 2) complete review of the existing production performance, 3) geophysical study, 4) geological model, characterization of the reservoirs, cartography, 5) analytical reservoir engineering, 6) numerical simulation of the reservoir, 7) preliminary environmental impact assessment, 8) production forecasts, 9) equipment, economic and financial evaluation, and 10) reports, presentations and deliverables.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $177,063 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  The study has been estimated by TDA to cost US$354,126.  In addition to the TDA grant funding of US$177,063, the Grantee will cover the remaining costs required to complete the full terms of reference.
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., Monday, May 6, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description
GSA proposes to conduct a two-step procurement to lease a build-to-suit facility containing approximately 10,000 to 12,000 rentable square feet of office and related spaces for use by Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for personnel, furnishings, and equipment. Space is required for ten years with the government having the right to terminate after five years.  Step one of the procurement will result in the identification of the most highly qualified prospective offerors who have expressed an interest in providing the facility and in the establishment of a competitive range based on past performance . The Government reserves the right to establish the competitive range based on initial Information Packages; if discussions are necessary, they will be conducted on behalf of the Government by the GSA Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer determines the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals, in no case more than five. The Government has prepared detailed Project Programs Documents for the facility. As part of the rental consideration, the successful Offeror shall provide all design and engineering services required to adapt the Government- furnished Project Program to the site and all construction services required to construct the laboratory facility. The successful Offeror/Lessor shall exercise the option to purchase, assume ownership of and responsibility for the Government-furnished Project Program at the point of lease award. To be considered for this procurement, each Prospective Offeror (and its team of architects, engineers, and contractors) shall submit the completed Information Package which may be obtained from GSA upon request. Only properly completed packages will be evaluated and considered in the establishment of a competitive range; preprinted brochures will not be considered. The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon past performance as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. In conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided by the offeror and data obtained by other sources. While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current and complete past performance information rests with the offeror. Copies of the Project Program documents will be made available during Step 2 of the procurement to those Offerors who are in the competitive range following completion of Step 1. However, the Project Program Documents will not be distributed at this time and the information that the documents contain is not necessary for preparing a response to the Information Package. Prospective Offerors wishing to receive the Information Package should submit a written request no later than April 8, 2002. To be considered for this procurement, completed Information Packages must be submitted no later than 5:00 CST, May 13, 2002.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER TO Vendor - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 14301 Highway 71 West Austin, TX 78738 THIS SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER SHALL BE ISSUED UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP). STATEMENT OF WORK Liquid Aluminum Chemical Reduction Technology Demonstration  for the Destruction of Organics in Transuranic Waste A. Scope of Work The objective of the Cold Demonstration Program is to demonstrate the ability of the Liquid Aluminum Metal Chemical Reduction Process to separate heterogeneous mixtures of organic material from TRU metals. By proving this chemical separation, radiolysis during storage will be eliminated. The patented Liquid Aluminum Alloy Chemical Reduction process for the destruction of ALL organics in Transuranic (TRU) waste.  The CTIC technology requires no pretreatment and accepts waste packages as-is, including heterogeneous waste. Because this is a chemical reduction technology, secondary waste and off-gas is minimal and both effluents are non-hazardous. Radioactive metal isotopes are captured in the metal bath, assuring containment and a stable waste form. Issues associated with incineration or other high temperature oxidation technologies are non-existent. The surrogate organic waste matrix treated by chemical reduction will be representative of Savannah River Site?s Transuranic mixed wastes.   The proposed system will require no pre-treatment or post-treatment. The process will provide near-absolute containment of surrogate radionuclides. The tests will also verify that the process produces no dioxins or furans, and meets all applicable regulatory criteria for retention of toxic metals, particulate, and criteria pollutants, while meeting Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC), and TRUPACT-II requirements. Batch cold demonstration tests are focused at treating reduced-scale quantities of surrogate heterogeneous organic wastes in the existing pilot plant.  A series of single-variable parametric tests will vary key independent variables from an initial baseline to assist in definition of operating conditions for subsequent optimization tests.   These variables will include temperature, waste matrix, contaminants, etc. A series of optimization tests will then be run with combinations of variables to seek optimum processing conditions.  Finally, a number of demonstration tests will be run with fixed conditions to demonstrate consistent repeatability. Each surrogate waste stream will be spiked with halogenated organics (1% each CCl4 and C2 Cl4) and metals (1% each elemental lead and mercury) to determine destruction and removal efficiencies.  Cerium oxide powder will also be added to each waste stream as a surrogate for plutonium oxide. During each of the batch runs, samples of aluminum melt, slag, off-gas, and scrubber water will be taken and analyzed to demonstrate containment of radioactive surrogates, and to confirm that no hazardous compounds are released in the scrubber water or into the air. Based on the results of the demonstration, CTIC will perform economic studies and provide a conceptual design of the proposed 1/5th scale unit. B. Tasks to be Performed Task 1 - Develop Test Plan The vendor shall develop a cold demonstration test plan. At a minimum, the test plan shall include objectives of the technology demonstration; description of equipment, setup, and procedures, duration of demonstration; and criteria for determining the success of the demonstration. The information shall include but not necessarily be limited to: the throughput, the time and personnel required for the operation, the duration of the demonstration, the expected production rate, the waste generated during the demonstration, any maintenance requirements (duration and interval), and the support activities that are required. The vendor shall submit Safety and Quality Assurance Plans. Sampling and Analysis plans shall also be submitted for the data to be collected, the description of equipment used for data collection and the description and sensitivity of instrumentation for processing and interpretation of data. The Test Plan and all other documents identified in Task 1 shall be submitted within 30 days after the contract award to the DOE Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) for review and approval. Task 2 - Mobilization The vendor shall prepare the facilities for readiness to perform the demonstration as stated in the approved Test Plans and related approved documents submitted in Task 1. The vendor shall also perform a pre-operational Upset Condition mass-energy balance and perform a readiness review to document system readiness to perform the demonstration as intended, in a safe manner. Task 3 - Demonstration The vendor shall test in accordance with the approved Test Plan developed in Task 1 to demonstrate the ability of the system to chemically destroy the sub-scale drums of waste, by eliminating all organic materials. All organic materials will be reduced to elemental carbon gas. The removal of all organic materials away form the TRU metals reduces hydrogen generation during storage. The halogenated organic materials are removed without incineration and with no dioxin or furan formation.  All the data shall be recorded in accordance with the approved Test Plan.  All maintenance activities will be recorded in project logbooks to provide insight to production issues and record lessons-learned. The type of maintenance activity, underlying cause, time to repair, and downtime shall be recorded. Task 4 - Demobilization Upon completion of the demonstration test program, the system will be inspected and cleaned, for other future uses by CTIC.  We will also be responsible for disposal of all waste generated during the demonstration. A debriefing shall be held with DOE and all end-users of the proposed technology to review the test and explore possibilities for improving the process, if required. Task 5 - Reports The vendor shall complete a Final Report at the conclusion of the demonstration.  The report shall also include the logs and data from the demonstration and an analysis of the effectiveness of the process/equipment and suggestions for enhancements if required.  The report shall also include suggestions for hot operations and identify and describe any additional equipment and/or modifications suggested for hot operations based on the lessons learned from Cold demonstration. C.  Deliverables:       (a) Monthly Status Report (b) Test Plans and related documents for Cold Demonstration (c)  Final Report Period of performance: Six Months after the award of the purchase order. This purchase order is being issued to the Clean Technologies International Corp., Austin, TX because Justification for Clean Technologies International?s Thermo Chemical Reduction Technology The objective of this effort is to demonstrate technology for the destruction of organics in transuranic, plutonium-238 contaminated, heterogeneous waste by chemical reduction process. The cold demonstration (with surrogate materials) of the reduction technology should prove the effectiveness of the technology to destroy organic constituents in a non-radioactive surrogate heterogeneous debris waste matrix that includes hazardous constituents. A significant fraction of DOE Savannah River Site (SRS) job control Transuranic (TRU) waste can not be shipped to Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) because of hydrogen generation limits during shipment. Organic material produces hydrogen due to radiolysis with PU-238 (contaminant). The surrogate organic waste matrix treated by chemical reduction will be representative of Savannah River Site?s Transuranic mixed wastes.   The proposed system will require no pre-treatment or post-treatment. The process will provide near-absolute containment of surrogate radionuclides. The tests will also verify that the process produces no dioxins or furans, and meets all applicable regulatory criteria for retention of toxic metals, particulate, and criteria pollutants, while meeting Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC), and TRUPACT-II requirements. Clean Technology International Corporation has developed a uniquely patented thermal chemical reduction waste treatment process which utilizes a proprietary liquid recant metal alloy bath, composed primarily of mixtures of aluminum, magnesium, calcium, and lithium, along with specific alloys of other alkaline metals. These natural spontaneous chemically reactive reducing alkaline metal alloys break down complex organic chemicals, including all the halogenated hydrocarbons, while capturing in the bath, most metals, including radioactive isotopes contained within the waste materials introduced into this chemical reactions medium. The advantage of this chemical reduction waste treatment process is that it is non-selective, any waste materials or any mixtures of waste materials can be processed at one time, because all of the treatment chemical reactions occur simultaneously. All of the chemical reduction reactions are naturally occurring and spontaneous.  A controlled reaction chamber atmosphere excludes most oxygen, creating a non-oxidative, non-combustion off-gas environment. A positive pressure anaerobic purge gas eliminates many of the problems found in the oxygen rich off-gasses of incinerators and plasma arc installations. To safely destroy organic material without producing hazardous off-gas emissions and to contain the PU-238 within the process, SRS needs a proof-of principle cold demonstration of the CTIC?s thermochemical reduction technology. The CTI proprietary thermochemical reduction technology has been demonstrated on other waste material at two other DOE sites and has demonstrated potential for the PU-238 contaminated waste. The CTIC technology has also received American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) peer review requested by the DOE. The ASME Review Panel considered the available data from the tests at the other DOE sites and recommended that SRS proceed with testing the technology on the SRS TRU waste surrogates. The CTI thermochemical reduction technology is proprietary and covered by broad patents. Development of a new similar technology will not only be significantly more expensive but may also require significant research and development so as not to infringe on CTIC?s patents to achieve the same objective. Therefore, this sole source justification request is based on the information that CTIC's thermochemical reduction technology not only meets the minimal functional requirements (no pretreatment, no formation of dioxins and furans, no hazardous off-gas emissions, containment of contaminants in the bath, stable final waste form), but is a patented thermochemical reduction technology that has demonstrated success in the similar hazardous waste materials. Sole source of the CTI technology will not only be cost effective but also timely and provide reasonable assurance of success. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this annoucement.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to the address stated herein or to facsimile number (412) 386-5770, Attn:  Robert Mohn.  Responses to this notice must be within fifteen (15) days after this synopsis is posted electronically. Please include your name, point of contact, address, area code and telephone numbe and facsimile number.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  The Technical Representative is Vijendra Kothari at (304) 285-4579.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Autoridad del Tr?nsito y Transporte Terrestre (ATTT), Attention: Doctor Pablo Quintero Luna, Director General, Apartado 3371, Balboa Anc?n, Panama City, Panama, Phone: 507 290 0514, Fax: 507 232 6136 :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a new traffic signaling and control system for Panama City. The feasibility study will allow the ATTT to access an existing World Bank transportation loan that expires in late 2003. The feasibility study will also include assistance with the preparation of tender documents for the procurement. 

With the tremendous growth and expansion in Panama City, saturated streets and insufficient traffic control measures have combined to make for terrible gridlock.  As part of the broader efforts to improve transportation in Panama City, and in part in anticipation of the new bridge over the Canal and new access routes, one of the most immediate needs for the city is a completely revamped and modernized traffic signalization and control system for the entire city.  According to TDA?s Definitional Mission, given the existing situation, implementation of even a simple traffic signalization system in Panama City should have a dramatic impact.  Simply by effectively synchronizing signals in the major corridors, traffic delay may be reduced by as much as 25% and combining them into a centralized system will have an even greater impact, particularly if complemented with minor intersection and other operational improvements, particularly with respect to bus operations.

Panama City?s expansion has created the need for several transportation initiatives.  One of the priorities that the government has focused on most recently (apart from the new bridge and Light Rail project) is improvement of the city?s traffic signalization.  Therefore, the ATTT requested TDA assistance for funding a feasibility study that will evaluate the technical and financial feasibility to design, supply, implement, operate, and maintain a centralized traffic signalization system for Panama City.  In addition, the government hopes to assess the possibility of developing a complementary Traffic Control Center as part of the project.  The current traffic signaling system in Panama is inadequate, unresponsive to the current conditions and in many cases not used.  At the most critical and busiest intersections, white-gloved police officers manually direct traffic.  Therefore, the ATTT has made it a priority to develop a system that provides Panama City with a modern, flexible system that is responsive to the current and future needs of the city, and its growth; a system that is integrated and allows for interoperability.  The goal is to install a system that manages traffic, reduces congestion and provides improved traffic flow and capacity for the city?s thoroughfares, all the while having a positive impact in terms of safety for motorists and the many pedestrians in the city.

A two-phase assistance is envisioned for the implementation of this project.  Phase I will consist of a feasibility study to develop an implementation plan for an improved traffic signalization system in Panama and will consist of the following tasks: Document Review; Assessment of Existing Traffic and Development of Traffic Forecasts; Define the Technical Requirements and Cost Estimates for the New System; Prepare the Pre-Qualification Documents; and, Economic and Financial Analysis.

Phase II will comprise technical assistance to develop tender documents for international competitive bidding, to assist in the selection of suppliers/contractors, and to assist contract negotiations with the preferred bidder for the procurement of equipment systems and works identified by the feasibility study in Phase I.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $364,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 5 p.m., April 25, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important, when combined, when compared to price.  Both Technical and Past Performance shall be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  1) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE FIRM - Technical capability will be based on submission of the following: Each offeror is required to submit one copy of the company's State Department of Agriculture Livestock License, the Humane Slaughter Act statement and certification, and any other documentation for the item, and show how the offered product meets or exceeds the requirements as specified in the Specifications.  Each offeror is also required to identify the type of animal breed(s) that will be offered.  We prefer Angus breeding from the same sire or from the 1/2 sibling (brother) sires and from the same momma cow herd.  Black Baldies (Angus X Hereford) are acceptable if they are from the same cow herd and same sire or 1/2 sibling sires.  A mixed lot of Angus and Black Baldies are acceptable if they are from the same cow herd and same sire or 1/2 sibling sire and are available in multiples of 6 (6,12,18,24, etc.) in addition to the other specifications shown in Section A.3.1.;  2) PAST PERFORMANCE - Past performance history may be based on the Contracting Officer's knowledge of any previous history of this type of work, customer surveys or any other verifiable information available to the Contracting Officer. In order to be considered for a contract award, Contractors shall provide a list of five (5) contracts of a similar nature and complexity that the were awarded within the past five (5) years or that is/are currently in force.  This information must be submitted with your offer.  For each contract, list the following: 1. Name, address, and telephone number of the contracting organization, the Government's Project Officer and Contracting Officer.  2. Contract number, type, and dollar value. 3. Date of contract and period of performance. 4. Project Description.  5. List any contract(s) terminated for convenience or default (partial or complete) within the past three (3) years.  Include the contract number, name, address, and telephone number of the terminating officer.  3) PRICE - Price includes all costs (i.e., animals, vaccinations, transportation) and any discount terms.  Offers shall be evaluated based on quoted prices without the EPA. The cost of the livestock during the option periods will be redetermined based on the livestock market prices published in the "USDA Livestock Market News" and the EPA clause.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to contract for a Noise Reduction System for the C-9B (DC-9-32F) Aircraft.  This effort will require a Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate for Navy C-9B Aircraft that meets or exceeds the Stage III Noise Levels as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Chapter 1, Part36.5(a)3, appendix C.  This is a non-developmental effort; the Government is seeking a Noise Reduction System with proven performance in the commercial fleet.  In addition, the modification must meet the following requirements:

1.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight of 110,000 pounds must be maintained.
2.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Landing Weight of 102,000 pounds with 40 degree Approach Flaps must be maintained.
3.	The rated engine thrust of a Stage II Configured Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines, as currently used on the C-9B Aircraft, must not be adversely affected.
4.	Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the currently installed Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines must not be adversely affected.
5.	Reliability and maintainability of Navy C-9B Aircraft and JT8D-9A Engines, as currently configured, must not be adversely affected.
6.	Any increase in Aircraft Empty Weight must not exceed 350 pounds.
7.	The system must be supportable by 2-level maintenance concept, O to D.
8.	The system should require no new or critical logistics support resource requirements.
9.	Must not require any additional transportability requirements.

The Government intends to award either one or two firm fixed price contracts for two of the major tasks required to complete this modification: 1. Acquisition of the STC Data and airframe parts required; and, 2.  Installation/integration of the airframe parts and JT8D-9A Engines, following modification o fthose engines to a Stage III configuration.  All work is to be accomplished in accordance with the FAA STC, the Navy Approved Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and the Pratt & Whitney Approved Maintenance Manual for the JT8D-9A Engine.  Prospective offerors may submit proposals for one, or both, of these tasks.  The offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government will be awarded a contract for that task.  If one offeror provides the best value for performing both tasks, one contract will be awarded to that offeror.    

This procurement will be conducted using the principles outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Navy intends to release the Request for Proposals, including any subsequent amendments, only over the Internet.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Offer for a construction project to retrofit a two-story historical building with a partial basement of a total area of approximately 140,000 gross square feet to comply with the modern seismic and egress code requirements.  The project primarily consists of addition of a reinforced shotcrete layer to the exterior or the interior faces of selected existing walls, the installation of steel reinforcement bars to the interior wall sections and the replacement of the selected exterior exit steel stairs.  The challenge will be to accommodate occupants' normal daily functions during all construction activities.  Noisy activities such as removal of existing plaster and shotcrete placement have to be performed away from normal working hours.  Lead paint and asbestos are expected to be present.  The project is separated into a base scope and four options to do additional seismic upgrades at specified building wings.  The Government may choose to exercise any or none of the options as occupancy condition and/or funding permits. The order of magnitude for the procurement is between $1 million and $5 million and the effort shall be completed within 330 calendar days after notice to proceed. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and is advertised under "Full and Open Competition". The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 233320 and $27.5 Million, respectively.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about 9 April 2002 with an anticipated offer closing date of on or about 9 May 2002. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the IFB/RFO.  To obtain a complete solicitation package including the plans and specifications, send a $75 non-refundable check to DMJMH&N to the attention of the Engineering Documentation Center (EDC), M/S 213-11, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO CHANGE THE NAICS CODE FROM 541990 to 493190.  The Chemical and Physical Carcinogenesis Branch (CPCB), Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) of the National Cancer Institute, has a continuing requirement for "The Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals."  The objective of this contract is to continue to build, maintain and disseminate information in the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals (RTLA), a unique registry on neoplasms in lower animals, which facilitates the study of  neoplasia and related diseases in invertebrate and cold blooded vertebrate animals by providing expert pathologic evaluation of specimens submitted  from all over the world.  The RTLA serves as a clearinghouse and diagnostic center for information on pathology of fishes, other lower vertebrates and invertebrates.  The RTLA not only accessions tumor material representative of the more than 20,000 species of fishes but also makes available slides, tissue blocks and an extensive bibliographic library of research papers dealing with tumors in lower animals for investigators working on the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of tumors.  The Registry is in the unique position to identify significant types and clusters of lower animal cancers from among the many specimens donated for diagnosis and archiving.  Through its varied activities the Registry 1) serves to correct or prevent misdiagnoses and misinformation, 2)  find cheaper or more efficient carcinogen bioassays, 3) discover  oncogenic viruses and their vectors, 4) elucidate the function of new or unknown genes found activated in lower animal cancers, 5) help understand the basic mechanisms of neoplastic transformation by studying the behavior of cancer in simpler animal systems, and above all, 6)  advance our understanding of the genetic, cellular, and physiologic mechanisms for cancer development.  For the last five years the RTLA has been operated under contract N01-CB-77021 to the George Washington University Medical Center, Department of Pathology. This acquisition has now been designated as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS code No. 493190.  The CPCB plans to award a single, incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement type contract for a five year period.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately 15 days after publication of this notice and proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the issue date.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Acquisition Branch Home Page by using the following Internet address:  http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.

<DESC>This is a draft request for proposal for acquisition of the Visual Information Management System (VIMS) for the Defense Visual Information (DVI) directorate of the American Forces Information Service (AFIS.)  This draft is published with the intention of obtaining comment from interested sources regarding acquisition approach, including the use of a Statement of Objectives (SOO) as a requirements specification document, the line item structure and the use of indefinite quantity line items to satisfy customer demand, as well as the use of the evaluation criteria shown in the draft RFP. The VIMS will help meet DVI modernization objectives by using advanced technologies to ingest, index, store, search, distribute, and manage Visual Information. The system will also supply DVI the ability to capture and automate the storage of motion media, still media, graphics, audio, and documents/text.  The SOO calls for innovative approaches to accomplish these objectives.  The line item structure is designed to promote innovation by allowing potential offerors the ability to configure solutions to various requirements within the generalized line item descriptions.  The indefinite quantity line item descriptions and the estimated annual quantities to be ordered against these line items are still being established at this time.  The overall structure of these line items can be determined by examining appendix 7 to the SOO.

All interested parties are advised that this is only a draft RFP.  It has not been subjected to higher headquarters review, and may change as a result of such reviews.  No offers will be accepted as a result of the publication of this draft RFP.  It is published merely to determine if there are any impediments in the approach taken to obtaining a system that meets the stated objectives.  This approach includes the use of indefinite quantity line items to make versions of the system available to authorized visual information activities according to their needs. 

The draft solicitation can be accessed at ftp://www.tasa.army.mil/pub/VIMSDRAFT 

Comments should be directed to Bill Gilmore at (909) 413-2412, fax (909) 413-2432, e-mail gilmorw@dodmedia.osd.mil.

<RESPDATE>040802
<CONTACT>Mary Jane Yeager, Contracting Officer, Phone (757) 864-2473, Fax (757) 864-7709, Email M.J.YEAGER@larc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is soliciting information regarding the availability of sources capable of delivering Earth Observing System (EOS) class remote sensing instruments capable of operating in low earth orbit to measure Top of Atmosphere Net Solar Radiation, Top of Atmosphere Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Surface Downward Solar Radiation, and Surface Downward Longwave Radiation.  Of particular interest is relevant experience with space flight verified EOS class radiation budget instruments delivered within the past 5 years. The required EOS class radiation budget instruments should fit within a right circular cylinder of radius 300mm and height 700mm when operational, have a mass of less than 50 kg, and consume no more than 55 watts (orbital average) assuming a near noon sun-synchronous orbit. Instrument thermal vacuum and calibration facilities should possess the capability of maintaining a pressure of less than 0.00001 torr for a minimum of 30-days continuous operation.  In addition these facilities must be able to thermal cycle the instrument through a range of no less than -30 to +40 C.  Minimum instrument calibration requirements are as follows:  Broadband Shortwave (&lt; 5 microns) absolute accuracy of 1% of the scene value, Broadband Longwave (5-100 microns) absolute accuracy of 0.5% of the scene value.  In addition, knowledge of the end-to-end instrument spectral response function is required in order to realize the calibration accuracies for typical earth scenes whose spectral weighting is typically much different from the calibration sources.  Responses should describe expertise in the design, modification, manufacture, assembly, qualification, calibration, and integration of the type of EOS class radiation budget instruments described above.  Describe your expertise in assessing and determining required modifications of an existing instrument design the same or similar to the type described above certified for a 5-year mission and improving the design to satisfy a 7-year mission at 86% reliability.  Provide details of the type of EOS class instruments you have developed for mission life in excess of 5 years. Provide the size of your business (number of employees); whether your firm is large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), small woman-owned, and/or a HUBzone small business.   Responses should describe facilities capable of providing ground-qualified calibrated EOS class radiation budget instruments as specified above.  For relevant facilities, provide operational history of the facility that includes radiation budget instruments calibrated, year of calibration, operating conditions, sources calibrated and trace ability standard, repeatability of measurements, and absolute accuracy achieved.  Responses should also include customers (point of contact and telephone number)  who can describe the capabilities of these facilities and the relevant instrument. Also provide references such as papers and journal articles (peer reviewed preferred) that describe calibration facilities. Describe your capability to deliver a ground-qualified calibrated EOS class radiation budget instrument of the type described above certified for a 7-year mission at 86% reliability by August 2006. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to: Melinda F. Cagle at (757) 864-7211 or via e-mail to m.f.cagle@larc.nasa.gov.   Procurement related questions should be directed to: Mary Jane Yeager at (757) 864-2473 or via e-mail at m.j.yeager@larc.nasa.gov. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. All responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) excluding reference material and submitted to: NASA Langley Research Center, ATTN:  Mary Jane Yeager, Mail Stop 126, Hampton, VA 23681-2199 not later than April 5, 2002.  The preferred method of submission is a Microsoft Word document via e-mail to m.j.yeager@larc.nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- Special Notice
<DESC>NIST and University of Colorado scientists, working at JILA in Boulder Colorado (formerly the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics), have developed frequency-domain stabilization techniques which are applicable to ultra-fast pulse lasers operating in the femtosecond time domain. These techniques provide strict control of optical phases of the numerous optical frequency comb components which represent a Fourier domain description of the Ultra-Fast pulses. In this manner it is possible to control the pulse repetition rate with an accuracy limited primarily by the utilized frequency standard, whether optical or microwave. Pulse synchronization and time delay scans can thus be implemented with a new level of precision via rf-domain phase-shift technology. For example, two separate fs lasers have been synchronized with a jitter of <5 fs rms, for a 1 ms averaging time. This precision of time stabilization is maintained for many minutes. A provisional patent has been filed by NIST, but some research issues remain. Industrial firms interested in this technology should contact:Dr. Jack Pevenstein, Office of Technology Partnerships, NIST, Gaithersburg  MD, jpevenstein@nist.gov   (310) 975-5519. General help about working with NIST can be found at http://patapsco.nist.gov/ts/220/external/main.htm.  Responsible scientists at JILA:
