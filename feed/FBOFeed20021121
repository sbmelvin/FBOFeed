<DESC>GSA is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective November 8, 2002, electronically only.  The Schedule is entitled "FSC 71, Part II - Household and Quarters Furniture". The solicitation number is 3FNH-F6-020002-B, Refreshed #1.  Special Item Numbers (SIN) 71-202 Wall Units (wood w/ laminate) and 71-203 Loft Groups, are 100% small business set-aside.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.  Search using Solicitation Number 3FNH-F6-020002-B, Refreshed #1 (include the dashes). 

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! program.  None of the Evergreen options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! website.  All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.  Contracting questions should be directed to the points of contact listed in the solicitation. 

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous.  Individual contract periods will begin on the date of award and will expire five years later (exclusive of any options or cancellations).  All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts with $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

ABSTRACT:

The Airbase Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Tyndall AFB FL is interested in receiving research proposals in the areas of advanced technologies that develop chemical reactor systems.  These reactor systems are intended to (1) produce, or deliver, weapon system specific chemicals in combat quantities, under deployed force conditions, (2) convert waste chemicals and materials from combat weapon system maintenance and sustainment operations to benign compounds, or (3) efficiently produce thermal, mechanical or electrical energy on demand using new high-energy chemistry and reactor systems.  In addition, reactor systems are desired that (1) utilize compact unit operations (2) are compatible with force deployment constraints, (3) recover waste energy for redistribution, and/or (4) recover water for reuse.  Systems developed under this effort must be capable of being easily integrated with existing deployed base utility systems and concepts while anticipating the requirements of the AF Expeditionary Aerospace Force doctrine for the future.

Proposals should describe scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas.

This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts:
PART I - Research Interests
PART II - Proposal Preparation
PART III - Proposal Evaluation
The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals.

PART I
RESEARCH INTERESTS

A.	INTRODUCTION

This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Airbase Technology Division (AFRL/MLQ) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984   For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.

AFRL/MLQ contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Deployed Base Infrastructure, and Force Protection.  This BAA is intended to cover technology associated with the sustainment and logistics support of advanced weapons.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MLQ should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the AFRL/MLQ technical person identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MLQ may have in a specific research project.

Prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are to submit white paper on their proposed research topic not to exceed three (3) pages in length.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Mr. Martin F. Kradlak, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Invited proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open.

A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate.  We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.  Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources.  While no parts of this requirement lend themselves to being severed for set-aside to Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), or Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), the Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  The division goal is to award thirty percent (30%) of the contracts to Small Businesses, ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, over the life of this BAA.  For the purpose of this BAA, the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received, which are acceptable regardless of source.

B.  MISSION

The mission of the Airbase Technology Division is to conduct research and engineering development that results in the demonstration of high-risk, high-payoff technology needed to meet the current and future requirements.  Long-term technology development is needed to produce lighter, more rapid bare-base deployment; a more secure and protected force structure; and rapid, effective deployment of advanced Air Force weapon systems.  Technological advances in these key areas will ensure sustained global superiority of the Air Force for the foreseeable future through improved Air Force and Joint Operations readiness, rapid exploitation and utilization of the space mission, the successful deployment of advanced, complex weapons, and more effective peace-time training.

PART III
PROPOSAL EVALUATION

A.	Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.
1.  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MLQ mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this Division?s overall research program.
2.  The offeror?s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
3.  The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.
4.  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds.
B.	Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MLQ technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort.  Proposals not considered to have sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review.
C.	It is the policy of AFRL/MLQ to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation within the Government.  The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal.
D.	Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MLQ program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-03NT41719-0
<CONTACT>Donna Jaskolka, Contracting Officer, 412-386-6106, jaskolka@netl.doe.gov;Donna Jaskolka, Contract Specialist, 412-386-6106, jaskolka@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY:  Notice is hereby given of the intent to issue Financial Assistance Solicitation No. DE-PS26-03NT41719 entitled Innovative Water Management Technologies and Concepts for Coal-Fired Electric Utility Boilers to solicit applications for cost-shared research projects directed at innovative water management technologies and concepts for coal-fired electric utility boilers.     Specifically, the solicitation will provide for the development of cost-effective solutions to emerging regulations and restrictions on water use and impacts on water quality associated with the generation of electricity by coal-fired power plants. Applications will be solicited in four (4) technical areas of interest: (1) Non-Traditional Sources of Process and Cooling Water (DE-PS26-03NT41719-1); (2) Innovative Cooling Technology (DE-PS26-03NT41719-3); (3)  Advanced Cooling Water Intake Technology (DE-PS26-03NT41719-3); and (4) Advanced Pollutant Measurement and Treatment Technology (DE-PS26-03NT41719-4).  Applications are being sought for applied research at the bench-scale to field-scale level for time periods of one (1) to three (3) years. The solicitation supports the overall goal of the Department of Energy/Office of Fossil Energy's Innovations for Existing Plants (IEP) Program to develop advanced technology and knowledge products that enhance the environmental performance of the existing fleet of coal-fired power plants.  The solicitation is part of the path forward of the Energy-Water Management component of the IEP roadmap (www.netl.doe.gov/coalpower/environment ) .  The goal of this research is to reduce water consumption per kWh of electricity produced by 25% by 2010, and reduce impacts of electricity production on water quality. DATES: The solicitation will be available on the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) webpage located at http://e-center.doe.gov  on or about December 13, 2002.  Applicants can obtain access to the solicitation from the address above or through DOE/NETL's website  at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business . SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:   Electric utility boilers are the second largest user of water in the United States, ranking only slightly behind irrigation in terms of total annual water use (USGS, Circular 1200, 1998).  The majority of the water used by power plants is for cooling.  The steam cycle requires a large amount of water to condense the low-pressure steam from the turbine. Recent regulations proposed under Section 316(b) (http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/316b/) of the Clean Water Act (http://www.epa.gov/region5/water/cwa.htm ) to protect against the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms in cooling systems could restrict the amount of water that power plants can withdraw for cooling and/or require the installation of new intake structure technology.  Retrofitting from once-through cooling systems to recirculating cooling towers can negatively impact plant efficiency due to increased turbine back pressure.  Power plant operations can also be disrupted due to the colonization of Zebra mussels and other types of bio-fouling on cooling water intake grates and screens. Water quality issues will also continue to receive attention in terms of coal power systems. Coal utilization byproducts (CUBs) such as scrubber solids and fly ash must be managed properly in order that all current and future surface and groundwater regulations are met.  Concerns about the fate of mercury, arsenic, and other trace metals in CUB leachates could negatively impact the commercial use and disposal of these materials.  More stringent control of air emissions under the Clean Air Act could result in cross-media transfer of pollutants from air to water.  For example, pending mercury regulations could bring about the need for additional monitoring, processing, and treatment of scrubber liquors and other aqueous streams associated with air pollution control equipment.  In addition, coal pile runoff and other plant-wide discharges may come under further scrutiny in response to future Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. DOE-NETL held a workshop in July 2002 with key stakeholders from industry, government agencies, regional and state regulators, research organizations, and academia to obtain input on the need for a private-partner research effort to address these emerging issues.  A summary of the workshop proceedings can be found at www.netl.doe.gov/coalpower/environment.  The workshop participants identified a number of near-, mid-, and long-term research opportunities directed at reducing the impact of coal power generation on water availability and quality. In response, DOE-NETL is issuing a solicitation focused on four areas of interest related to coal-based electric utilities and water.  Details concerning the solicitation are described below.  This solicitation will serve to help ensure the continued availability of low-cost electricity from coal while meeting growing demands for clean water. The objective of this solicitation is to solicit applications for cost-shared research projects directed at innovative water management technologies and concepts for coal-fired electric utility boilers.  Specifically, the solicitation will provide for the development of cost-effective solutions to emerging regulations and restrictions on water use and impacts on water quality associated with the generation of electricity by coal-fired power plants. All applicants should clearly describe how the technology, if successfully developed and applied, would impact the cost of operating a coal-fired power plant in terms of impacts on COE (cost of electricity) relative to existing technology.  The applicant should also provide a projection of the market penetration of the proposed technology or concept in terms of both existing and new coal-fired electric utility boilers.  Applications will be solicited to address four technical topic areas: (1) Non-Traditional Sources of Process and Cooling Water.  Applications are being sought to evaluate and develop cost-effective approaches to using non-traditional (i.e., not from freshwater or saline surface water supply) sources of water for cooling and other power plant needs.  Examples include surface and underground mine pool water, coal-bed methane produced water, and industrial and/or municipal wastewater.  The technical, cost and permitting issues associated with collecting, treating, transporting, storing, and discharging/disposing of these non-traditional waters should be considered. (2) Innovative Cooling Technology.  Applications are being sought to improve both wet and dry recirculating cooling tower systems.  Innovative methods of plume abatement are desired to reduce water loss and minimize visual impacts from cooling towers.  Improvements in the energy penalty associated with wet and dry cooling versus once-through cooling are also sought.  Research to reduce the higher capital and operating costs associated with dry cooling versus wet cooling and the development of hybrid wet-dry systems that optimize the advantages of wet and dry cooling towers is also sought. (3) Advanced Cooling Water Intake Technology.  Future regulations to protect aquatic organisms under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act may impact the operation of cooling water intake structures on new and existing power plants. Applications are sought to meet performance standards for intake structures that would be required by Section 316(b) regulation.  Specifically, advanced intake structure technologies such as intake screen systems, passive intake systems, diversion or avoidance systems, and fish handling systems are sought. Innovative methods to control bio-fouling of intake structures, which will be more of a problem with the lower intake water velocities required to reduce fish impingement are also sought. (4) Advanced Pollutant Measurement and Treatment Technology.  Future controls on the emission of mercury and possibly other hazardous air pollutants (e.g. selenium, arsenic) have raised concerns about the ultimate fate of these contaminants once they are removed from the flue gas.  Preventing these air pollutants from being transferred to surface or ground waters will be critical.  Applications are sought for advanced technologies to detect, measure, and remove mercury, arsenic, selenium and other pollutants from the aqueous streams of coal-based power plants such as blowdown water, wet scrubber effluents, and ash pond waters.  Advanced technologies are also sought for removal of chemicals used in treatment of cooling water. It is anticipated that there will be five to seven (5 - 7 ) Financial Assistance (Cooperative Agreement) awards with performance periods ranging from 12 to 36 months.  The total estimated award value for all projects selected under this solicitation is approximately $4.8 million; this amount includes the mandatory minimum recipient cost share of twenty percent (20%). Eligibility for participation in the Program Solicitation is considered to be full and open.  All interested parties may apply, except as noted herein. Applications submitted by or on behalf of 1) another Federal agency, 2) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by another Federal agency; or 3) a Department of Energy (DOE) Management Operating (M&O) Contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation. However, an application that includes performance of a portion of the work by a DOE M&O contractor will be evaluated and may be considered for award subject to the provisions to be set forth in Program Solicitation DE-PS26-03NT41719 (NOTE: The limit on participation by an M&O contractor for an individual project under this solicitation cannot exceed 25% of the total project cost.).

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard has a requirement for the completion of new, as well as ongoing, trade studies and engineering analysis pertaining to C-130J aircraft.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to issue a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (Marietta) to perform these special studies and analysis.  The Coast Guard purchased six (6) C-130J aircraft from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aero Co.(Marietta), pursuant to the FY 2001 MILCON Supplemental Appropriation Bill.  The appropriation also required the Coast Guard to missionize the C-130J aircraft into a maritime patrol aircraft.  The Coast Guard designation for the missionized aircraft is the HC-130J.  In preparation for missionizing the aircraft, the Coast Guard also acquired engineering services in the form of sixteen (16) specialized engineering studies to develop reports to be used to assist in the development, installation, and testing of the HC-130J.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, the vehicle used to acquire these services from the aircraft OEM has become unavailable.  The Coast Guard intends to place this contract with the aircraft OEM to complete the ongoing sixteen studies and analyses and to complete additional work in the following areas: Sensor integration; airframe modification to accommodate revised CG requirements; software integration to accommodate revised CG requirements.  The Coast Guard expects to issue a sole source contract for the performance of these studies unique to the C-130J airframe and the Coast Guards HC-130J maritime patrol variant.  This is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation is available, nor will one be issued.  Parties that believe they can fulfill this requirement are required to submit qualification packages prior to the closing date.  Packages must contain a full description of the partys capability to fulfill the Coast Guard requirements, including obtaining access to airframe data, in enough detail for the Coast Guard to determine that the firm is capable.  Marketing information and high level corporate capability statements are not desired and will not be accepted.  In the event no additional capable firms are identified through this synopsis, the Coast Guard will award a sole source contract.  For Minority, Women Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has a program to assist minority, women-owned and disadvantaged enterprises to acquire short term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts. Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing. The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<CONTACT>Joseph Comella, Contracting Officer , Phone (202) 366-9568, Fax (202) 366-9555, Email jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is soliciting proposals to support the teleprocessing needs of the National Driver Register (NDR) program. The NDR serves as a national clearinghouse for problem driver reporting. States provide the NDR with information and then access the system when drivers apply for licenses or renew them. In support of its functions, NDR requires a timesharing vendor offering an IBM compatible mainframe service capable of connecting to state hosts via AAMVAnet, the network of the American association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. 

The NDR capability is predicated on an IBM z/OS system (currently version 1 release 2) with ACP/NCP, and RACF (or similar security) providing TSO and supporting IBM's CICS Transaction Server for OS/390 version 1 release 3 (See Section C.2.3.2).  The COBOL for OS/390 compiler is used to compile programs (batch and CICS).  The NDR does not intend to consider any alternative environments and, furthermore, requires support from a vendor who has at least one year's operating experience with TS 1.3 or newer release on the proposed system by the proposal due date.  This approach will facilitate the transition from the current timesharing environment to the new one.  

The NDR's current support is based on the use of an IBM 7060-H70 multiprise mainframe with two 100 MIP engines running under the z/OS, version 1 release 2, operating system.  An identical, equivalent, or faster mainframe that supports hardware data compression is required.  The vendor's mainframe must support NDR's estimated  processing requirements as specified in Section C. and it must also be able to support NDR's response time requirements (see Section C.4.4).

This requirement is to support the National Driver Register's data processing and communications needs.  All of the NDR's technical and general support requirements for data processing and telecommunications network management as defined in the solicitation number DTNH22-03-R-05013 must be met.  
The Government contemplates awarding a firm fixed price type contract for a base period of three years with four one-year option periods. The Government plans to issue an open competitive solicitation under the NAIC Code 514210 (data processing services). Award will be made to a single offeror whose proposal is technically acceptable and offers the best value to the Government. Evaluation of offers will be done in multiple stages: technical responsiveness (mandatory requirement and migration plan); corporate capability (client satisfaction, experience, personnel, disaster recovery); system and software benchmarking, and system life cycle costs.

This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web  (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or  www.eps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments  (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A draft of NDR requirements was previously issued for industry comments under reference number NTS-10-2-05927. Offerors should base their proposals in response to this current solicitation.

All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered. Requests and communications  (written or electronic) concerning this requirement must reference solicitation number DTNH22-03-R-05013. The solicitation is estimated to be issued on or about December 3, 2002.

All potential Offers should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kim McDonald, Acting Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 478-926-1922.  Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns. This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9018 (Mission Essential Quantity): If a proven source is not the low offeror, the basic quantity may be split into a First Article quantity, for award to the low unproven offeror, and a Minimum Essential Quantity, for award to the proven source, with the balance of the requirement established as options in both contracts.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.

<SOLNBR>F29601-02-C-0300
<RESPDATE>081502
<CONTACT>Jayne Faris, Contracting Officer, Phone 505 846 5935, Fax 505 846 7049, Email Jayne.Faris@Kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>DESC: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Space Vehicles Directorate, Spacecraft Technology Division, Space Electronics and Protection Branch, Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source, follow-on contract to Northrop Grumman for the following described efforts based on technology developed and demonstrated by Northrop Grumman under previously awarded open competition.

BACKGROUND: The Miniature Satellite Threat Reporting System (MSTRS) program provides for research, development, and demonstration of satellite radio frequency threat reporting technologies. Northrop Grumman solely designed, fabricated, and integrated the prototype phase I MSTRS radio frequency receiver hardware and associated software with the exception of a Los Alamos National Laboratory developed single electronic snapshot circuit board and a MIJI software algorithm. Northrop Grumman designed, fabricated, and integrated the MSTRS system that is manifested and installed for flight on shuttle flight STS-107, significantly participated in the design of the MSTRS shuttle experiment, and partially completed the design of a miniaturized phase II receiver system.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposed contract is to: 1) provide engineering support for the MSTRS prototype phase I risk reduction shuttle experiment. This engineering support will include developing MSTRS tune tables and operating MSTRS ground command and data processing stations; 2) perform data analysis of the MSTRS phase I prototype shuttle experiment data and evaluation of MSTRS performance; and 3) complete prototype phase I development by developing user manuals, system demonstrations, and writing technical reports.

The period of performance for the above tasks is 36 months with an anticipated start date of October 2002. A contract will be awarded to Northrop Grumman provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms. Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A draft program plan as well as resumes of key personnel must also be included in the response. Responses are limited to a total of 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Submit responses to Maj Jayne Faris, Det 8 PKVE, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 day of this notice. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: SIC 541710, size standard 1,000 employees. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. It is anticipated that a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, with a classification level of Top Secret is required during the performance of this effort. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors, primarily during the proposal development phase of this negotiated acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel in the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions. Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first communicate with the Contracting Officer. In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact the Ombudsman at the Phillips Research Site of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Mr. Eugene DeWall, Director of Contracting, at (505) 846-4979, or at 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

  Item 1: Preliminary Survey of 11.4 kilometers of forest trails.  (Maps are available as a separate attachment under Solicitation KTN-03-04)

There are three segments to this project:  The first segment can be reached by proceeding north from Ketchikan along State highway 7 to the end of the highway.  From there a person must hike along an existing survey line running adjacent to Lunch Cr.  The existing survey ends at station 1+080, which will be the start of the new survey.  (est. 7.3km) 

The second segment can be reached by driving to the end of Canyon Road within the city limits of Ketchikan.  From there, hike up the existing gated road to the south end of the KPU Carlanna Lake dam, where the line to be surveyed begins.  (est. 3.2km) 

The survey of segment three begins where the existing Perseverance Trail ends.  The Perseverance Trail can be reached by driving along State highway 7 from Ketchikan to the Revilla Road junction at Ward Cove.  From there one proceeds 1.00 mile to the Ward Lake road and turns right towards the day use area.  The trailhead is located on the left hand side, just beyond the Ward Creek bridge.  (est.  0.9km)

Survey lines are flagged florescent orange and the beginning and ending points are marked in the field.

Description

Work. Complete the preliminary route survey (P-line) for a forest trail and provide survey notes for trail design.  Furnish all labor, equipment, instruments, materials, transportation, lodging, and other incidentals necessary to complete the survey in accordance with these specifications and acceptable engineering practice.

Conduct the preliminary survey under the direction of a professional engineer, land surveyor, forester, or civil engineering technician familiar with forest road P-line surveys.  Proof of the previous accomplishment of at  least 10 km of forest P-line survey will be required if requested by the CO.

Materials

Stakes.  Provide stakes that have the nominal dimensions of 25 mm x 50 mm x 460 mm.  Paint the top 50 mm of all stakes with fluorescent red paint.  Other dimensions, materials, and marking may be used if approved in writing by the CO.

Survey Notes. Furnish field notebooks with covers that will protect the contents and retain the pages in numerical sequence during field use.  Use moisture-resistant paper for field notes.  When using electronic data collectors, provide electronic and hard copy notes in a format approved by the CO before the start of work. 

Government-Furnished Documents.  A topographic map and photocopies of aerial photos showing the location of the routes to be surveyed will be furnished by the Government.

Survey Requirements

Precision. Perform all work under this specification to meet the accuracy and precision requirements as follows:

Augular accuracy _  1 set direct/reverse 2 degree rejection limit 
Closure _  3000 mm/km (by GPS acceptable)
Vertical _ 500 mm/km
 
Marking Stakes. Legibly mark all stakes with a stake pencil that leaves an imprint or with waterproof ink.  Mark in conformance with the format and nomenclature specified by the CO.

Survey Notes Format. All survey notes will become the property of the Government.  Use the survey note format furnished by the CO. Other formats may be used if approved by the CO.

Print all manually recorded survey notes in characters at least 4 mm high, and make them legible at a distance of 750 mm.  Delete errors by lining out. 

Record project identification and survey activity on the cover and first page of each notebook to identify the contents. Consecutively number notebooks as book  number _ of _.  At the beginning of each day's work, record in the notes  the date, crew names and positions, instrumentation, and weather.

Consecutively number electronically recorded survey notes, and use headings to identify the contents.  Support and accompany the electronic notes with a bound notebook that records the project name and, for each day, the date; crew names and position; instrumentation; weather; type of survey; stationing of survey sections performed; and survey data or sketches that cannot be electronically recorded.

Record the station where the P-line enters and leaves muskegs, wet areas, clearcuts, differing timber types, and where the P-line crosses roads, surveys, property boundaries, timber unit boundaries, and any unusual physical features.

Measure and record all stream information including width and depth of existing water, composition of stream bottom material, and estimate width and depth of maximum high water.  Record sketch showing stream and P-line relationship, any unusual features, and direction of stream flow.

P-Line Survey and Marking. A flag line has been established on the ground for the survey route and is marked with fluorescent plastic flagging.  If there are skips in the flagging or the flagline appears to be incomplete, survey the route based on the flagging that is present and promptly notify the CO of any discrepancies.

Clearing. Locate the survey line to avoid cutting timber greater than 150mm dbh.  Clear vegetation along the survey line to facilitate safe travel and surveying.  Remove clearing brush slash from the travel or work area.  Brush slash shall not be deposited in streams.  Cut all brush and trees as near to the ground as practicable.

Survey Ties. Establish survey ties to existing trails or existing P-line surveys. 

When the new survey starts from an existing road or trail, begin the survey at the centerline of the existing road or trail.  Measure and record the distance and magnetic azimuth for 50 m along the existing road or trail centerline in all directions from the new survey beginning point.

When the new survey starts from an existing P-line survey, begin the survey at an existing survey point.  Measure and record the distance and magnetic azimuth for 50 m along the existing P-line survey in all directions from the new survey beginning point.

Horizontal Traverse.  Follow the established flag line and establish and stake the horizontal alignment on the ground as a series of tangent lines and angle points (PIs) at the intersection of adjacent tangents.  Establish and stake intermediate points at all significant vertical ground breaks of 1 m or more along the survey line, at drainages and streams, physical features, and all significant ground breaks within the cross section limits.  Do not vary the survey line from the flag line more than 1 m unless approved by the CO.  Set stakes no more than 20 m apart.  Stake all curves of 20 degrees or more every 5 m. Stake all other curves every 15 m. Do not place stakes on logs, root wads, or stumps.

Establish and stake intermediate points for streams at the top and bottom of each bank, edges of water, and center of each stream.

When survey stakes fall in an existing roadway, trail, or obstruction offset the stakes left or right from centerline (perpendicular to tangents and on the bisectors of angle points) clear of the roadway, trail, or obstruction and mark the offset distance on the side of the stake facing the survey line.

Measure and record horizontal distance between survey points. Stake and measure points to the nearest 200 mm.

Measure bearings between angle points as a magnetic azimuth bearing.  Record a bearing ahead and a bearing back at each angle point.  Measure bearings to the nearest degree.  Allowable deviation between bearing ahead and reciprocal bearing back between two angle points is 2 degrees.  Do not exceed 30 degrees deflection between tangents.

Vertical Profile. Use a method to measure the vertical profile along the horizontal traverse that conforms to one of the METHODS described below, as DESIGNATED in the SCHEDULE OF ITEMS.

(a)  Method I - Percent Slope.  Measure and record the percent slope between each centerline survey point  Record the percent slope ahead and percent slope back at each centerline survey point. Measure slope to the nearest one percent.  Allowable deviation between percent slope ahead and percent slope back between two survey points is (+/-) one percent.

(b)  Method II - Profile Levels.  Locate permanent benchmarks as directed by the CO,  and construct them to allow a level rod to stand vertically and squarely on the mark. Record the location and description of each benchmark in the level notes. Use appropriate survey equipment between benchmarks to determine ground elevations at each centerline survey point, to the nearest 300 mm, by leveling between them.  Determine the elevation of each benchmark by running level loops between benchmarks.  The accuracy requirement for vertical closure on benchmarks is (+/-) 500 mm/km.

Cross Sections.  Measure and record cross sections at each survey point.  Take cross sections on each side of the survey line, at right angles to tangents and on the bisectors of angle points.  Record cross sections right and left determined by looking ahead on survey line. Record ground shots for these cross sections in terms of percent slope plus or minus from ground at the survey line and slope distance from the survey line. Extend cross sections 5 m from the survey line when the ground side slope is less than 30 percent, 7 m from the survey line when the ground side slope is 30 to 50 percent, and 10 m from the survey line when the ground side slope is over 50 percent.

Measure cross sections and record them to the nearest one percent slope and 200 mm slope distance.  Allowable deviation of cross section line projection from a true right angle to tangents or a true bisector of angle points is 3 degrees.

Measure and record all significant breaks in topography of 10 percent and more along the cross section line.  Extend cross section lines to adequately depict drainages.  Describe in the notebook all existing features such as streams, bridges, drainage structures, buildings, fences, rock bluffs, property or timber boundaries, existing monuments, or other physical features within or adjacent to the cross section.

When streams are not perpendicular to the survey line, measure and record the vertical profile of the stream centerline and the magnetic azimuth of the stream centerline.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Dynetics, Inc., 1000 Explorer Blvd., Huntsville, AL  35806 to upgrade the previously developed Imaging Millimeter Wave Fuze (IMF) Toolbox (Version 2) to include the following:

Automated Capability to Baseline Distributed IRMA (Infrared Modeling and Analysis).  IRMA is the Air Force multispectral signature tool.  The IMF requires a configurable security policy within the framework used to implement the distributed execution of multiple IRMA sensor simulations on multiple machines connected on a LAN. The IMF simulation software shall include provisions for user configuration of the security policy governing the remote execution of IRMA on remote machines.

CESM Engineering Display Capability.  The IMF requires an engineering display based on the CESM (common engagement space mapping) algorithms to support the fuze algorithm developer.  This CESM engineering display shall provide a detailed graphical representation of those CESM parameters used to determine warhead aim and detonation outputs.  This requirement supports the integration of the CESM algorithms into the IMF fuze simulation tool. 

The Imaging Millimeter Wave Fuze Toolbox (Versions 1&2) has been acquired previously under Purchase Orders and the software with users manuals has been delivered to the Air Force.    Dynetics Inc. is the only company capable of designing, developing and coding the Imaging Millimeter Wave Fuze Toolbox that meets the government's requirements without substantial duplication of efforts and costs.  To perform this effort a company must have experience with the Air Force?s weapon flyout simulation tools, MSTARS, and the Air Force owned millimeter wave scene generation software, IRMA.  Dynetic's experience with MSTARS and IRMA along with their previous experience in developing IMF (Versions 1&2) makes them uniquely qualified to perform this upgrade effort for the Air Force.

Dynetics, Inc. is the only known contractor source of expertise available with experience using and modifying the Imaging Millimeter Wave Fuze Toolbox.  The output from this contract is critical to support the FY03 R&D program, Focused Ordnance Controller with Aimpoint Selection (FOCAS).  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Dynetics sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  However, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Due date for responses (original and 1 copy) is 9 Dec 02, 3:00 p.m. CST.  No electronic responses will be accepted.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00421-03-R-0022 solicits/requests proposals for the study of the aging properties of fiber optics in a Naval aircraft environment. Responses to this BAA will be accepted at the Contracting Office for a three (3) month period from the date of this announcement and are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  Contract award will be based on a scientific and engineering evaluation of the response (technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) to determine the merit of the technical approach used. Of primary interest are studies that characterize the life expectancy of aviation grade fiber optic cables when they are placed in a Naval Aviation-like environment, which combines humidity, vibration and temperature variations into a single, all encompassing test.  Naval Air Systems Command, Aging Aircraft IPT, AIR 4.1D, is interested in receiving proposals regarding the study of the aging properties of fiber optic cables in a Naval aviation environment. The situation that we are looking to characterize is as follows:  Several studies have shown that moisture (humidity) can permeate certain fiber claddings in a relatively short period of time.  These studies have also indicated that this may weaken the fiber as well as degrade the optical signal and the cable?s available bandwidth.  Additionally, the studies show that these effects are accelerated by large temperature swings, vibration and stressing.  Overall this may effect the expected lifetime of the fiber.  No information concerning the lifetime of fiber in a Naval aviation environment exists in the available literature.  The Joint Council on Aging Aircraft is attempting to look ahead and address areas that may be a future Total Ownership Cost issue.  This study would require the analysis of aviation grade fibers placed in an environment similar to the one found in Naval aircraft in an effort to determine their aging properties.  Several studies have been published in journals regarding the effects of environment - particularly moisture - on the useful lifetime of fiber.  Today's fibers are being used in a number of applications including aircraft.  While the aircraft environment may be similar to other stressful environments, it is different enough that we cannot adequately address this issue without a detailed study.    Additionally, while the fibers in use today have been tested for individual environments, they have not been tested in a combined environmental test.  The proposal will be to study possible aviation grade fibers to characterize their properties in hopes of identifying the expected lifetime of these various fibers, identify which fibers performs best over time, and to see if the aviation environment causes fibers to behave unexpectedly.  This information should be useful to the Naval aviation industry and customers because it could allow for either changing their selected fiber, changing their method of installation, or planning for scheduled maintenance. The object is risk and cost reduction.  Proposals may be submitted anytime during the three (3) month period following publication of this announcement. Proposals may address one or more of the concepts listed above. Proposals shall be limited to exploratory development where feasibility has already been demonstrated. More than one proposal may be submitted.  Early submission is encouraged. Proposals may be evaluated as they are received or may be collected and reviewed periodically. The merit of the proposals shall be determined based on the following criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merit, (2) the offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility; (3) the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives, and (4) realism of proposed cost. Please provide a detailed breakdown of approach, available resources, proposed cost/prices, and a preliminary schedule so an analysis can be performed. Technical proposals shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages. Contractors shall submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of their proposal to Contracts Group, Attn: Darrall Lafayette, Code 251315, NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, Bldg 441, Unit 7, 21983 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. The cost of preparation of the response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any other contract. The point of contact for technical issues is Mr. Dan Slick (301) 342-2275, e-mail: slickdg@navair.navy.mil. Mr. Darrall Lafayette (301) 757-8956, email: lafayettede@navair.navy.mil is the point of contact for contractual matters.

In addition, a question and answer document under this BAA will reside on the following website for questions received of a general nature: http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm. Offerors are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. For planning purposes, the period of performance is estimated to be from 3 to 6 months at a level of effort of 0.5 to 3 man-years per year for each contract. Reasonable deviations / exceptions will be considered. Contract type will be a firm fixed price completion. No formal solicitation will be issued; this BAA is the solicitation.

The Offeror's control of costs including cost incurred for changed work. The offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and overall concerns for the client.  This assessment will be utilized as follows:  A) The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of the offeror's technical/management proposal.  A record of less than satisfactory performance may be an indication that the promises made by the offeror are less than reliable.  B) The assessment of the offeror past performance will be used as one means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and other competitors, therefore be given a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is only satisfactory, even though both may have an acceptable technical/management proposal.  C) An offeror proposing as a joint venture may receive a neutral rating for past performance if a history of performance as a joint venture is not provided.  Risk for performance may be elevated if an offeror lacks past performance with the proposed design agent.  Past performance will be evaluated using the information required and provided under Factor 1 - Design/Build Experience.  The government will also draw from available CCAS and ACAS database reports and will consider other information obtained from other sources.  The evaluation of past performance is a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-08. This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541219 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.

It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. William Risso, Rockville, Maryland, to provide expert technical consulting services in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Information Technology (IT) to a project to replace NIH's administrative computing systems.

NIH is seeking the assistance from an individual with an expert understanding of NIH technology, budget and related administrative systems, and experience and expertise in technology related issues.

NIH requires the expert technical consulting services to support the NBRSS project for a period of two and one-half years.  Specifically, the contractor shall assist the NBRSS Functional Manager in the following areas:

Provide overall project and business management assistance to the NBRSS Project Office.  These services include: planning; organizing and coordinating assigned projects and activities for the NBRSS.  The specific current tasks include assistance on the following:

1.	Developing and maintaining the balanced scorecard evaluation approach, with specific attention to the project monitoring level, for the NBRSS implementation phase.

2.	Developing and implementing a monitoring and review methodology specifically checking the System Integrator's adherence to the Project Plan, the proposed budget, and overall schedule.  This methodology will incorporate "earned value" calculations.

3.	Maintaining and monitoring a tracking chart that follows the schedule of NBRSS activities to be accomplished prior to the start of activities of the functional work teams.

4.	Performing policy and issue analyses for the NBRSS Project on a myriad of topics as assigned by the Project Manager.  Following these analyses, develops appropriate policy documents/ memoranda/ reports/presentations for NBRSS review. 

NIH has recently completed a comprehensive management and systems analysis to define the requirements for a new administrative computing system and to evaluate potential systems that may satisfy these requirements. Parallel efforts on the NIH Business System (NBS) Project, referred to as the "Project", have defined NIH business requirements and analyzed available IT solutions. The convergence of requirements definition and solution evaluation, together with a cost/benefit/risk analysis, form key components of a business case for proceeding to replace NIH's legacy administrative systems.  NIH is planning to begin a phased migration to a new business system with commercially available ERP software. 

NIH is seeking assistance from an individual with an expert understanding of NIH IT and administrative systems, senior management skills and experience, and expertise in ERP information systems that is evidenced by prior experience, vendor certification, and other training.  NIH requires the expert consultant services for a period of three years.  Specifically, the contractor will assist the NBS Project Manager in the following areas:

1.	Helping NIH staff to define, evaluate and review results of the management and systems analysis

2.	Developing recommendations for the NBS Steering Committee and the NIH Information Technology Board of Governors

3.	Coordinating the development of the final system design for each subsystem
 
4.	Defining the ERP software role and the role of customized software in supporting each new subsystem of the new business system 

5.	Researching and defining the role of electronic commerce in the ERP context 
  
6.	Coordinating requirements of NIH senior managers, and assuring satisfaction of those requirements

7.	Achieving compliance with NIH IT architectures

8.	Reviewing internal ERP technology and implementing technology refreshment

9.	Establishing migration, implementation and testing plans for each subsystem

10.	Evaluating all testing and documentation prior to full implementation

Mr. Risso's previous experience as a senior executive at NIH uniquely qualifies him as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary consultant services.  This requirement represents a continuation of services that he is currently providing to NIH.  He therefore will require no orientation to NIH functions and operations. He has extensive expert knowledge of IT issues, particularly at the NIH; has a long and outstanding record as a senior federal manager; has intimate knowledge of the business processes and procedures of the NIH; and is certified in ERP software. He has vast knowledge and experience in all aspects of the Project, including the organization, the staff, the business requirements, and the technology and functionality of the commercially available solution packages. He is an experienced systems designer and implementation expert, and holds advanced degrees in computer engineering.   NIH has determined that Mr. Risso is the only source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience who can successfully complete the requirements listed above.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a Request for Proposals available.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NIH.   Authority:  U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a).

Description
DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) plans an ?Industry Forum? relative to future acquisition of hydrazines (all grades) and ancillary services, on Wednesday, 11 December 2002 in San Antonio, Texas.  The purpose of this forum is to invite industry participation and input as DESC prepares its acquisition strategy for hydrazine products and ancillary services to support the US Air Force, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Commercial Space Launch Activities through 2020.  DESC anticipates a solicitation being issued within 2 months after the Industry Forum.  Specifically, the Government is seeking input from industry on the potential for a pilot plant with pre-production samples approved by the Government, the amount of time needed to construct a new hydrazine facility and/or retrofit of an existing facility, the number and amount of time to obtain environmental permits, as well as input from industry on other major issues relative to the development of the acquisition strategy for this major procurement, to be announced at the Industry Forum.  Interested participants should provide a list of attendees to the DESC Contracting Officer on or before 6 December 2002.  Participants may also meet with the Government after the Industry Forum on a one-on-one basis, for a period of one to two hours, if desired.  Those desiring a one-on-one meeting after the Industry Forum should so indicate when providing their list of attendees.  The Industry Forum will be conducted from 9:00 AM to 12 Noon, Central Standard Time, the morning of 11 December 2002 and the one-on-one meetings will be held in the afternoon and/or the day after, depending on how many potential offerors attend/participate.  Discussions during these special one-on-one meetings will be limited to industry input only relative to topics discussed in the Industry Forum.  No discussions beyond the Government obtaining additional input from industry on the specific topics addressed in the Industry Forum will be allowed.  Lastly, industry will be encouraged to submit written input and/or recommendations after the Industry Forum, as well.  Please provide written notice of interest and list of attendees either via fax to 210-925-9758 or e-mail to the attention of the following:  Larry Brehm, Contracting Officer, 210-925-7249, or email:  lbrehm@desc.dla.mil or Ellen Shannon, Contract Specialist, 210-925-2124, or email:  eshannon@desc.dla.mil

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems suitable for effective training.  Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems spare and repair parts are the focus of this pre-solicitation notice.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends on negotiating and awarding several spare and repair parts buys on a sole source basis from 2 January 2003 through 31 December 2003.  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $10 million.  The Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training system platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  Furthermore, the sole source original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of spare and repair parts within these subsystems are enumerated within Attachment (B).  Attachments (A) and (B) may be found at the NAVAIR Orlando Business Opportunities web site at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/Ebusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD.  Once linked to the web site you must change DOCUMENT TYPES to "All".  The attachments will be located under the heading "Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training Systems Spare and Repair Parts".  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (B), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor as this strategy may serve the Government's best interest.  The sole source rationale for acquisition of the Attachment (A) major subsystem parts from Attachment (B) OEMs follows.  Current acquisition principles dictates that the Government's requirements be described in performance terms.  Accordingly, training systems design/build contractors are afforded the opportunity to propose and implement trainer designs meeting or exceeding performance requirements while taking budget considerations into account.  An essential element in establishing a technical design is selecting the appropriate trainer hardware whereby the design/build contractors leverage from previous experiences in ascertaining the most reliable cost-effective sources of supply.  These design decisions and hardware selections are subject to Government scrutiny during preliminary and critical design reviews thereby lending credibility that the Government's performance requirements are paramount during the design and hardware selection process.  In addition, the design/build contractors are subjected to periodic Contractor Purchasing System Reviews (CPSRs) by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) with the assistance of the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) thereby ensuring that parts selections from OEMs are performed in an unbiased manner.  These design/build contractors provide a great deal of provisioning expertise which culminates in the delivery to the Government of an Interim Support Items List (ISIL) inclusive of detailed OEM sourcing information for those items recommended as spare and repair parts.  This provisioning exercise by the design/build contractors takes into consideration the mechanical and electrical functionality, detailed specifications, and strict tolerances of the selected items in consistently meeting the Government's performance requirements.  In addition, during parts selection, design/build contractors exhaustively research form and fit requirements to permit precise interfacing with other selected trainer components, subassemblies and assemblies.  The interchangeability and reliability of spare and repair parts with the items currently installed in the trainer is essential.  These exact form, fit and function requirements do not lend to substitution.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD provides training device design/build contractor delivered ISILs to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) located in Battle Creek, MI whereby the DLIS performs screening of the ISILs to ascertain the availability of alternate sources of each of the ISIL items.  Based upon this independent screening no alternate sources of the Attachment (A) major subsystems parts are available from other than the Attachment (B) OEMs.  The spare and repair parts recommended by training device design/build contractors are commercial or non-developmental items.  Accordingly, proprietary detailed drawings are not made available to either the design/build contractors or the Government.  Acquisition of the proprietary drawings for purpose of conducting competitive procurements of spare and repair parts is cost prohibitive.  In addition, reverse engineering of spare and repair parts is cost prohibitive and unwarranted given the minimum quantities of each item procured.  Award of Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems spare and repair parts requirements to other than the Attachment (B) OEM sources recommended by the device manufacturers would result in trainer downtime attributable to inadequate interfaces, tolerances, and specifications thereby resulting in critical loss of training.  See numbered note 22, which is modified as follows.  The proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the Attachment (B) sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (B) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Responses to this pre-solicitation notice shall be received NLT 10 December 2002.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to the Attachment (B) pool of sole source OEMs.  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one OEM, it will compete these acquisitions among the OEMs.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SYNOPSIS
Joint Counterintelligence Assessments and Technology Group (JCAG) War Room
This initial examination of a War Room Team-Based Analysis approach for the conduct of counterintelligence analysis will focus on the JCAG Foreign Visitor program to monitor and track foreign visitors to Department of Defense (DOD) facilities.  This project will consist of a two-month effort to:

?	Determine JCAG requirements and to map out the decision process related to the Foreign Visitor activity;
?	Examine an initial data set to produce ?real world? CI scenarios using the existing Technology Sector Operations Center (T-SOC) infrastructure.
?	Examine and recommend additional tools and methodologies which can further address the JCAG requirements;
?	Recommend an overall war room architecture for meeting JCAG?s needs.

This effort is meant to demonstrate a ?real world? utility to JCAG?s CI analytical efforts (within a 2-month timeframe), as well as provide a foundation in which to build an optimal analytical war room addressing JCAG?s current and future needs.  Any further requirements will be fully competed.

<DESC>NA Solicitation is extended to December 13, 2002. Addendum to the Wing Stand Narrative: Height adjustments are APPROXIMATELY 20 to 32 on the inboard side.  It is imperative that the entire stand assembly matches the 7-degree dihedral of the KC-135E wing, and there is a height adjustment of 12.  Other than height adjustment, when positioned  under the aircraft, the stands do not require to be mobile.  The means of height adjustment are up to the manufacture, as long as it meets all requirements of OSHA and AFOSH standards.  Our hangar dimensions are 155 Wide by 156 Long.  Therefore, the sta nd assembly must break down into two to four manageable components.  All required railings must be installed to comply with the requirements of OSHA and AFOSH standards, and must be removable.  Regulated and conditioned air is supplied at the hangar walls.   Air feed lines need to be at the outboard side of the stand.  The air manifold needs be large enough to handle two pneumatic air drills, operating simultaneously, per wing.  The requirement for electrical outlets have been deleted in its entirety.   Addendum to the Dry-Bay Stands Narrative: The dry-bay stands may be built as a separate unit, or may be incorporated into the above wing stand design.  We require the dry-bay stand to be largely constructed of aluminum, for durability, weight management, and maneuverability.  Base construction may  be aluminum, steel, or other material that will not significantly detract from maneuverability.  If built as a separate unit from the wing stand, all required railings must be removable, and meet the requirements of OSHA and AFOSH standards.  If built as a separate unit, the height, and adjustment capabilities of the dry-bay stand must match the wing stand stated above.  If the wing stand and dry-bay stand are built separately, we require the railings between the two stands be removable, to form one contin uous platform.  Air requirements will be identical to the addendum to the wing stand narrative.  The requirement for electrical outlets have been deleted in its entirety. No other changes.
