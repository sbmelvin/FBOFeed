A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

To be considered for award, the principal firm must submit a completed Standard Form 330 (SF330), Part I &amp; II, summarizing their qualifications, experience and capabilities, which will be evaluated by a government board to determine the most highly qualified firms. Firms submitting recent (within the past 5 years), and relevant performance in preparing design projects valued between $100K and $1M may result in a higher rating and should be addressed accordingly. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. The evaluation factors for selection, listed in relative order of importance are:</p>
<p>(1) Professional Qualifications: Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, as demonstrated by education, experience, registration and management ability of personnel assigned to this contract and any applicable outside consultants.

When design authorization and funding is received, a formal Request for Proposal for the first specific design project will be issued to and negotiated with the top ranked firm(s). If negotiations are unsucessful, or when an authorization is received for a subsequent project, negotiations will then begin with the next highest ranked firm not previously offered a project for negotiation.

The period of performance for this project is 01 March 2010 - 28 February 2011 with the possibility of three one-year options.  The estimated annual value of the contract is $180,000.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for a NATO ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.

The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments.

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility, which is used to nominate a firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to negotiate a modification to Contract number HHSN271200800008C on a sole-source basis with the University of Pittsburgh for a project titled "Comorbidity Analysis of the NIDA MTA 14 Year Follow-up Study". The University of Pittsburgh will provide enhanced sample retention, neuroimaging, longitudinal quantitative data analysis, and qualitative data analysis on subjects and controls for its 14 year MTA Follow-up Study. The goals of this program are currently being fulfilled through seven current NIDA-funded research and development contracts. The specific work to be conducted will include: (1) enhanced sample retention through increased compensation of recruitments and a periodical newsletter, (2) neuroimiaginng through brain imaging (MRI) among subjects and controls, and (3) longitudinal quantitative data analysis through a comparison of incident and prevalent drug abuse outcomes and comorbid conditions between randomized treatment groups as well as comparisons between subjects and community.<br /><br />The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) is a multi-center longitudinal follow up study of children treated for ADHD. The MTA study initially enrolled 579 ADHD subjects at ages 7 to 9, at seven sites, for a randomized trial comparing medication, behavioral, combined treatments, and community care as usual, in the early 1990s. Extensive data on drug use and psychiatric status, psychosocial and academic functioning, and service use have been collected over 12 years, and year 14 (ages 21-23) data collection is to take place in 2009 and 2010. NIDA anticipates a period of performance of 2 years. Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the FAR 6.320-1, Only One Responsible Source. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in providing the required services make competition unfeasible.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interests and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (by January 4, 2010) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 10 announces an opportunity for the Modernization of Jackson Federal Building, Seattle Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION651 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) (B-52)Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), Ohio
1.0	Description
1.1 Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) in support of the 651 AESS is seeking information on the capability of existing radar systems as potential replacements for the current B-52H strategic radar system, and on contractors who are interested in designing, developing, integrating, and supporting the test program for a new/replacement radar system for the current B-52H AN/APQ-166 radar.

1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertainin! g to this requirement.
2.0	Background
The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a B-52H strategic radar replacement program.  The objective would be to identify, integrate, test, produce, and field a replacement radar system to address supportability issues beginning in 2016.
The AN/APQ-166 Mechanically Scanned Array (MSA) radar system currently installed on the B-52H fleet was originally fielded in the 1950s, last upgraded to its present configuration in the early 1980s, and is approaching the end of its useful life.  The antenna assembly has corrosion issues and several components of the radar system are experiencing diminishing manufacturing source/materiel shortage (DMS/MS) situations.  Forecasts indicate that the B-52H radar system will become unsupportable beginning in the 2016 timeframe. 2.1 Planned Production:  A total of 76 aircraft would require retrofit with the new radar system, along with spares and trainers
2.2 Delivery Period:  Initial production kit deliveries in FY 16
2.3 Limitations:  Maximum number of aircraft that may be retrofit in any given year is between 17 and 24
2.4 Security Requirements:  In accordance with established B-52H Weapon System Master Security Classification Guide, 2 September 2008

3.0	Requested Information
Responders shall identify all of their potential alternative radar system(s) that could replace the AN/APQ-166 currently installed on the B-52H, and their capability to support the integration and production of the replacement system(s).

<a href="mailto:lisa.d.duncan@us.army.mil">AMCOM Contracting Center - Missile (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997)  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the potential development of a Single Chip Inertial Sensor Package (SCISP).  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes.  The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the development of a Single Chip Inertial Sensor Package (SCISP).  Previous designs have generally still been modular in overall approach with the gyroscopes, accelerometers, and their associated electronics being designed and fabricated as separate entities.  This approach required separate packaging for each of the sensors and their electronics.  The primary development goal of the potential SCISP development would be to fabricate all sensors on a single silicon die to eliminate as much packaging volume as possible.  It is envisioned that problems would be identified during the course of the development of the SCISP that arise specifically due to the close proximity of the sensors.  The primary research purpose of the potential SCISP development would be to identify those problems, postulate methods of mitigating those issues, and, to the extent possible, implement those mitigation strategies to evaluate their effectiveness.  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on risk, capability, price, collaborative research opportunities and other information in planning the potential development of a SCISP.  As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive technical, programmatic, and collaborative research methodologies to assist in the development of the following: (a) Determine the ability of current and near term technology to support a SCISP.  (b) Identify potential sensor designs, whose owning institutions are willing to collaborate on this potential development effort, that have demonstrated the potential to meet the objectives stated below. (c) Determine the approximate cost information for the potential SCISP development effort.  (d) Establish a reasonable schedule for the potential SCISP development effort.  Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper addressing each of the areas of interest listed above.  If available, fabrication and test data from existing sensor designs should be included in the white paper.  The Single Chip Inertial Sensor Package (SCISP) would contain six inertial sensors, three accelerometers and three gyroscopes, on a single silicon die or on individual die placed within a single package that consumes no more volume than a single die.<BR>The desired size of the SCISP silicon die containing all sensors is less than 17mm by 17mm by 1.7mm.  Vertical stacking or novel packaging of individual silicon die each containing a subset of the sensors will be considered if a good packaging approach is proposed and the volume of the stack remains less than 500 cubic mm.  This volume is allocated for the sensors only, the electronics will have a separate volume allocation.  It is envisioned that the electronics for the SCISP will utilize state-of-the-art die-level packaging techniques for the sensitive pickoff amplifiers to minimize the signal path lengths for the critical signals.  It is envisioned that all other required electronics will be packaged using standard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) mounting techniques with discrete electronics.  The currently envisioned SCISP will not include Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) development.  The smaller missile applications targeted by the SCISP generally have higher dynamic requirements than historical missile systems because their small size enables them to be more agile.  Fortunately, they generally also have less stringent performance requirements because they fly for shorter distances and for shorter times.  A summary of the desired inertial sensor performance goals of the SCISP is as follows: Gyro Range:  plus or minus 1500 deg per sec; Gyro Bias:  0.1 deg per sec; Gyro Scale Factor:  1000 PPM; Gyro Angle Random Walk:  0.5 deg per root hr; Gyro Acceleration Sensitivity:  20 deg per hr per G; Gyro Bandwidth:  100 Hz; Accelerometer Range:  200 G; Accelerometer Bias:  70 mG; Accelerometer Scale Factor:  1250 PPM; Accelerometer Velocity Random Walk:  3 meters per sec per root hr; and Accelerometer Bandwidth:  100 Hz.  The performance goals are not the primary goals of the potential SCISP development.  The performance goals are secondary behind (1) proving feasibility and (2) identifying and mitigating issues caused by close proximity of the sensors.  The envisioned SCISP would be expected to leverage existing gyroscope and accelerometer sensor designs from one or multiple collaborating entities and lay them out onto a single silicon die to reduce wasted packaging volume.  This could potentially require that (1) all sensors be fabricated simultaneously using compatible processes, (2) sensors be fabricated independently and afterward be mounted onto a single die (substrate), or (3) sensors be fabricated separately and be stacked on a single silicon die (substrate).  It is highly desirable that all sensors be fabricated simultaneously using compatible processes as this has the potential for very low fabrication and assembly costs, but alternate concepts are encouraged and will be considered.  AMRDEC maintains its own silicon Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication facility and has extensive MEMS fabrication capability within our Weapon Sciences Directorate (WSD).  It is desirable for the potential SCISP to utilize these facilities to the maximum extent possible for cost, schedule, and process repeatability purposes.  The envisioned potential SCISP development would be aggressive research whose primary goals would be to (1) prove feasibility of placing all six inertial sensors on a single silicon die and (2) identify issues and mitigating strategies caused by close proximity of the sensors.  Because of this, the potential SCISP development would likely begin with existing sensor designs with electronics functioning at least at the breadboard level.  It is not the intent of the SCISP to develop new sensors or electronics but to repackage existing sensors and existing electronics.  The government encourages creativity and collaboration in response to this RFI.  All white papers must include the following: 1. A brief description of the proposed SCISP; 2. A brief description of the proposed gyroscopes and accelerometers on which the proposed SCISP is based; 3. A brief description of the existing fabrication procedure used in the fabrication of the gyroscopes and accelerometers on which the proposed SCISP is based; 4. Test data from existing gyroscopes and accelerometers on which the proposed SCISP is based; 5. A brief description of the notional layout, fabrication, and assembly procedure for the proposed SCISP.  This is anticipated to be only notional; 6. A brief description of any projects that the respondents company is or has been involved in that would be leveraged for the SCISP or are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.  This should include any relevant lessons learned; and 7. The respondents recommendation for proper collaboration vehicle.<BR>The objective of this process is the development of a more realistic SCISP program to (1) prove feasibility of the SCISP concept and (2) identify and mitigate issues caused by close proximity of the sensors.  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Rather this Request for Information is part of a technology survey that is an integral part of US Army planning efforts for possible future programs. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information, neither is the government liable for any costs associated with the preparation of this RFI.  Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper not to exceed 25 pages in length and no smaller than size 12 Times New Roman font.  Responses may include multiple concept submittals.  After RFI release, there will be a period of for question submittal.  All questions must be submitted in writing and reference the RFI number no later than 3:00 CST on 4 December 2009; telephone requests for addition information will not be honored. All RFI responses must be submitted to the technical point of contact, Brian Grantham at brian.e.grantham@us.army.mil no later than 12:00pm (noon) Central Standard Time (CST) on 04 January 2010.  In addition to the information provided above, all responses to this RFI must include the RFI number, company or institution name, Company and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact information.   Acknowledgement of receipt will only be issued if a return receipt is requested with the submission. Please do not submit any classified information.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Technology Applications Office is seeking potential sources with existing or planned service offerings for worldwide, airborne, high bandwidth enroute communications services to include the following as a minimum:  Service coverage available today and proposed for the future: include level of commitment for proposed service. Is it already contracted, is a contract pending, is it simply being planned, and when will it be available, etc., Super High Frequency (SHF) spectrum utilized, cost structure for the service, data rates supported to the aircraft and from the aircraft,  antenna apertures supported by the service along with data rates available for the given apertures supported, limitations of the service, flexibility of service [variable rate plans, pay as you go plans, virtual network operations (VNO)], scalability of the service (how many platforms can operate simultaneously under a given coverage area and at what data rates) provide data that verifies the advertised scalability of the service.  Any capabilities to hand off existing data connections as aircraft transition from one satellite beam or footprint to another. Modem type and waveform technology utilized: provide minimum/maximum Internet Protocol ((IP) data rates possible in transmit and receive. Other platforms the service currently supports (shipboard, vehicular).  Other information the potential source believes is important regarding the service. Regulatory: provide certifications for use and describe how those certifications might be applied to a worldwide capability if the existing capability is currently a regional capability. (Host Nation Agreements, over flight and landing rights).  Is there an option for guaranteed Service Level Agreement (SLA) (QOS and RF capacity SLAs)? Describe form factor of system that would go into an airborne platform (size, weight, and power requirements) for system/systems offered.  Describe the ability for service to touch DISN POP.  Interface to modem for baseband must be IP. Operational Security (OPSEC): What considerations have been considered to protect U.S. government data: Where will the teleports be located? Does the modem proposed provide TRANSEC?  Does the modem have an ability to reconcile its connection to the hub at a given teleport without sending geo-coordinate information to the hub to make the calculations required to connect.<BR><BR>If the services doesnt exist but is in planning stage, request potential source respond with the planned service capability given the following information:  Date rates to include large fixed wing aircraft (e.g. C-130 class and target); given an effective aperture from 18 to 30, what transmit and receive IP data rated can be provided.  Data rates to include small fixed wing aircraft (e.g. business jet or U-28 class) U.S. Government currently employs a 12 inch Ku band parabolic antenna aperture; given a 12 inch aperture, what is the maximum transmit data rate that can be provided by the service?  What is the maximum receiving data rate that can be received on the 12 inch antenna? Typical RF data rates (not IP throughput rates) on current service are advertised as 20X 512 Kbps connection using a 54 Mhz transponder or 10 X 1024 kbps connections using a 54 Mhz transponder. The U.S. Government prefers a minimum of 1024 Kbps (IP data rate) transmit from the aircraft using a 12 inch dish.  Data rates: Rotary Wing (e.g. UH-60 or larger) given an effective aperture from 12 to 16, what transmit and receives IP data rates can be provided. Scalability: how many simultaneous connections can be possible for large aircraft? How many simultaneous connections can be possible for small aircraft?  How many simultaneous connections can be possible for rotary wing aircraft? Ability for the service to hand off an existing data connection as the aircraft transitions from one satellite beam or foot print to another dynamically (no noticeable loss of service to the user). Coverage: what is the plan to provide worldwide coverage (70 degrees to 70 degrees latitude) and when might the service reach the point of providing worldwide coverage? Request vendor address the ability of the service to support maritime and ground vehicular communication on the move capability. Regulatory: what is the plan to certify the proposed service? When is the certification expected to be completed? (Host Nation Agreements, over flight and landing rights).  Cost: what is the cost structure for using the services including terrestrial backhaul? What discounts are available if the government commits to bulk service? Is there an option for VNO services? Can the service be landed at government teleports? OPSEC:  what considerations have been considered to protect U.S. Government data? Where will the teleports be located? Does the modem proposed provide TRANSEC? Does the modem have an ability to reconcile its connection to the hub at a given teleport without sending geo-coordinate information to the hub to make the calculations required to connect?  Modem/modems: What modem will the service utilize? What criteria were used in determining the selection of this modem?  Terrestrial infrastructure: how will the data that arrives at a given teleport be moved back to CONUS? Is terrestrial infrastructure physically and logically redundant? What are the limitations of the planned service? What is the planned SHF spectrum to be used?  Any other information the potential source believes is important regarding the planned service? The interface to modem for baseband must be IP.  <BR><BR>Parties purporting to have the requisite credentials MUST furnish in writing (white papers only) factual information which clearly supports and demonstrates evidence of such abilities. The information must be clear, concise, complete and shall include, at a minimum: name and address of firm and size/ownership of business. <BR><BR>This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  This information will be used for market analysis to determine what currently exists and what might be possible from a commercial service perspective only.  This notice should not be construed as a request for proposals or an obligation on the part of the 	U.S. Government.  The NAICS Code is 517410.

The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supervision and transportation required to provide certified professional American Sign Language Interpreters on an as-needed basis for group meetings, training sessions, and one-on-one meetings between a deaf employee and his supervisor at the Burlington Finance Center (BFC) in Williston, Vermont.<br />2. This Purchase Order will be a time and materials order. The performance period is a one year base period with two one year option periods. The prices per hour for services provided and travel time will be negotiated as fixed price including profit and overhead. The interpreter's travel costs will be reimbursed for actual travel in accordance with the Federal travel Regulations. The current Internal Revenue Service optional standard mileage rate for business miles driven will be used for mileage. The current rate can be found at: www.gsa.gov/mileage, row: "If no Government Owned Vehicle available". The current rate at this time is $.55 per mile. No profit or overhead will be added to travel costs.<br />3. The estimated number of hours/anticipated frequency of requests for interpreter services are approximately two sessions a month, for 2 hours each, dependent upon the needs of the agency. Two or more interpreters may be required, depending on the length of the meeting and technical difficulty of material to be translated. There may be an occasional need for up to eight hours of interpreter services in one day for training seminars. <br />4. The ceiling price for this order is $4,000.00 for the base year, $4,120.00 for the first option year, and $4.243.6 for the second option period. This is the maximum amount the contractor is authorized to receive for services provided under this order. Any change in the ceiling price will be accomplished via modification.<br />5. The Government will usually provide service requests a minimum of ten business days in advance of the required service date. The contractor shall schedule available certified professional American Sign Language Interpreter(s) requiring the lowest travel costs and notify BFC of confirmed interpreter(s) within 8 days of the request. Notifications shall include a request for approval for reimbursement of travel costs, identifying the individual(s) and their travel commencement and completion location(s).

<CONTACT>Traci S Leach, Phone 410-965-9539, Fax 410-965-9560, Email traci.leach@ssa.gov
<DESC>Purpose:

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research to identify firm capable of providing all necessary services to support the ongoing and expanded deployment of the SSA Access to Financial Institution (AFI) Project.  

Introduction:

SSA’s eligibility rules require that an individual’s liquid assets must be under a specified limit.  Currently, there are over 7 million SSI recipients on the SSA rolls, and approximately 2 million individuals apply for SSI each year.  In addition, SSA conducts periodic re-determinations of eligibility which include obtaining account balance information maintained by individual financial institutions (FI).

The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 permits SSA to require SSI applicants and beneficiaries to provide authorization for access to their respective FI, in order to provide verification of their financial assets.  In most states, SSA’s current process for obtaining asset verification is paper-based.  The form SSA-4641-U2, “Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Obtain Account Records From a Financial Institution and Request for Records”, is mailed to the FI and asks the FI to provide account balance information over specified time periods.

The purpose of the AFI is to convert to electronic media the information exchanges (e.g., form SSA-4641-U2) that now occur in paper form between FI and SSA; obtain titling, balance and related information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor in addition to verifying the account balance and interest income revealed by the applicant, recipient or deemor; detect unreported accounts in financial institutions located in proximity to the home address of the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor and to automate the process whereby FI are reimbursed for the cost of account verification. Interested parties must be able to deliver a web-based application that allows for the electronic transfer of account information between SSA and FI.  The application would be used to verify eligibility for SSA’s means-tested program, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  

Background:

Accuity, a SourceMedia Company, has previously created and deployed a web-based application that electronically transfers asset information between FI and SSA on a geographically-limited (i.e., California, New Jersey, and New York) basis since 2005.  
The current SSA AFI project successfully verifies financial information exchanges and detects undisclosed financial accounts to all 110 Field Offices (FO) in the states of New York and New Jersey and to a limited number of users in the Office of Quality Performance (OQP) 15 regional sites. SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services.  To SSA’s knowledge, Accuity is the only company that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers, name and social security number as the identifying information.

Current Requirements:
SSA intends to implement, enhance and deploy the AFI system nationally in incremental phases overt the next five years. Interested vendor parties with the proven capabilities to create, support, and maintain such a system that electronically transfers asset information between FI and SSA nationwide are invited to submit responses to this notice.  Responses to this notice should consist of full capabilities statements demonstrating the firm’s previous and ongoing experience in developing and/or deploying such systems, including specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information. Specifically, responses must address the following items:

1.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to establish and operate a secure automated system that would electronically transfer asset information between FI and SSA on SSI applicants and beneficiaries nationwide.  The information provided to SSA must include account titling, monthly balances and interest income on all types of accounts or certificates held by SSI applicants and beneficiaries, and may include spouses and parents’ accounts.  The system must provide an interface that allows SSA users to request and receive verified asset information.  

2.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to recruit most of the nation’s FI to participate in the electronic exchange of asset information, including your ability to create a system that would interface with large numbers of FI.  Such capability would include an established relationship with the financial community.  Also, include in your response your ability to train FI personnel in using the newly-created system.

3.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to detect unreported asset information in at least 10 FI located in geographical proximity to the applicant and/or beneficiary residential address.  Include in your response your ability to increase and decrease the number of FI set in the geographical parameters, or to change the distances used in the geographical proximities. 

4.	Please demonstrate your firm’s ability to electronically reimburse FI adhering to common accounting principles for fees charged by FI for account information, as well as your ability to provide billing information to SSA.

5.	Please provide evidence that your firm is legally approved to exchange information with financial institutions.

6.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to provide SSA with comprehensive management information, program data, and analytical support related to data collected from the system.

7.	Please demonstrate your firm’s capability to establish a secure/dedicated facility for encrypting backups for associated data files.

Response Instructions:
Any responsible firm that feels it has the capabilities and resources to meet the requirements listed herein may respond in writing no later than October 22, 2009 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA’s objectives. Interested parties shall respond by submitting their capability statements by email to traci.leach@ssa.gov.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENTS—FINANCIAL INSTITUTION  VERIFICATION.  The Government will not pay for, nor will it return, information provided in response to this notice.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses, or lack thereof,  to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Greenville, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 9600 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of approximately 8060 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for Ten (10) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2010.  The delineated area is:

Begin at intersection of NC 11 North (Memorial Blvd.) and Tar River.  Proceed North on NC 11 North (Memorial Blvd.) to the intersection of US 264 (Martin Luther King Jr. Hwy).  Turn east on Martin Luther King Jr. Hwy. at the intersection of the Tar River.  Turn West along the Tar River to NC 11 North (Memorial Blvd.) to complete Market Area.

Other applicable requirements include:

On site surfaced parking for 29 employees and at least 17 public spaces for clients.
Reserved on site surfaced parking for 7 official Government vehicles.

Approximately 250 square feet of outside secure storage.  Secured storage of approximately 150 square feet for pyrotechnics and firearms.  Combustible materials and flammable liquids cannot be within 50 feet of explosives.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Europe District is seeking expressions of interest from qualified Contractors to perform work for Remediation and Contaminant Mitigation Services for a variety of media including groundwater, soil, surface water, drinking water, air, and buildings.  Techniques vary, but may include in-situ methods, ex-situ methods, removal, natural attenuation, physical, chemical, or biological processes, or any combination thereof.  The specific requirements are site and contaminant dependent, and are defined during site assessment, investigation, and/or scoping, and frequently require prompt action due to mission, legal, environmental, or health protection issues.  Both US and Host Nation Laws must be considered in performing this work.<BR><BR>The objective of the contract is to provide environmental support to NAUs current and potential clients.  Generally, work will be performed for the European Command (EUCOM), where U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) installations are located however, this could be extended to areas covered by other Department of Defense agencies, and/or other U.S. Government agencies or partners.  Although there are no restrictions as to the percent distribution by work locations, the majority of the work for this contract is expected to be in Germany, Italy, and other countries including Belgium and the Netherlands.

<DESC>LASER PREDICTIVE AVOIDANCE FOR AIR &amp; SPACE APPLICATION
<p>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />10-RD-RFI(HEL-JTO)</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested parties by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL-JTO), pertaining to concepts that address the potential need to develop a centralized predictive avoidance capability that encompasses both the air and space arena. This Request for Information is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201, and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor should it be construed as such. Respondents are advised that HEL-JTO is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse the costs incurred by providing the information requested under this notice. This RFI is open to any capable and qualified commercial source, and partnering is encouraged.</p>
<p>The HEL-JTO is interested in concepts and potential technology solutions that address the challenges associated with high energy laser system (HEL) operations in unrestricted airspace environments. The Department of Defense has established processes and procedures for the testing and demonstration of laser weapons under controlled environments, typically in restricted areas. As HEL weapon systems mature and become operational, the need for establishing a decentralized predictive avoidance capability is critical to their use. The HEL-JTO is interested in advanced fire control/command and control concepts that could become the standard fire control / predictive avoidance tool for all HEL weapon platforms.</p>
<p>Responses should consider but are not limited to, 1) Potential Laser Weapon System (LWS) platforms, missions, and performance characteristics and capabilities for monitoring LWS readiness, 2) capabilities to continuously monitor the State vectors of mobile LWS platforms and multiple targets, to monitor the source-to-target environmental conditions, and to control event sequences for target engagements, 3) the ability to interface with current and future Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control and avoid potential known air-space conflicts, 4) Fire Control System fail-safe capabilities that prevent unintentional target engagements and provide automated shutdown in the event that an air or space-based object enters the LWS target-engagement field-of-view (firing-zone). There may be other considerations and all will be considered.</p>
<p><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS:</p>
<p>1. There is no page limitation. Responses shall be delivered to Ms. Linda Buix, Contracting Officer, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL/RDKL, 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117, no later than December 22, 2009. All responses shall be in an electronic format on CD-ROM. Administrative questions should be directed to Ms. Linda Buix at 505-853-4654. Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Richard Damron at 505-248-8200.</p>
<p>2. All respondents shall include their assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.</p>
<p>3. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees. Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary Data: All information submittals containing proprietary data shall be appropriately marked. It is the respondent's responsibility to clearly define to the Government what is considered to be proprietary data.</p>
<p>5. Responders are advised that any data submitted to the Government in response to this RFI will be released to non-Government advisors for review and analysis. The current non-Government advisor is Schafer Corporation, Chelmsford, MA. Any non-Government advisor will strictly serve in an advisory capacity to the Government. All Non-Government advisors have appropriate Organizational Conflict of Interest clauses in their contracts with HEL-JTO and have nondisclosure agreements on file with HEL-JTO. All responders must clearly indicate in their responses if they have any objections or concerns regarding the use of non-Government advisors.</p>

<a href="mailto:jenniffer.vazquez@us.army.mil">Fort Sam Houston Contracting Center - West</a>
<DESC>Description<BR>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Ft. Sam Houston is seeking information on how an interested contractor could meet the requirement to deliver software scheduling solution to assist METC.  METC is seeking a commercial off the shelf (COTS) or modified off the shelf solution. No prototypes or developmental solutions will be considered. <BR><BR>  <BR>Scope of work summary: (Please refer to attached Draft of Performance Work Statement (PWS) for additional information.<BR><BR>The METC requires a fully-hosted, internet-based COTS solution specifically designed to optimize logistics and scheduling for complex, high-volume training environments. The METC intends to initiate a 12 month initial phase to implement the software in view of ascertaining best practices, conducting business process reengineering and developing a methodical center-wide implementation strategy.  <BR>To this end, the successful vendor will be required to provide all of the hardware, software, hosting and professional services necessary to implement a turn-key enterprise-wide logistics, scheduling and training system solution, capable of scheduling all required facilities, instructional personnel and equipment and providing student housing capacity planning and reservation management down to the bed level, maintenance ticket management and tracking student check in/check outs.  The successful vendor will be required to stand up an initial operating capability within 45 days after award and a full operational capability ready for METC data load within 90 days of award.  The successful vendor shall provide an operational readiness up time of 99.99 for the hosted environment.  Additionally, the successful vendor shall provide for backup of the operational database and will provide a instance of the virtualized operating environment, data set and configuration data, that will be maintained within the METC data center virtualized environment.  In addition, the vendor will help identify and document those planning and coordination deficiencies that exist across the enterprise that either impede or reduce the overall timely delivery of effective and relevant training.  The contractor will support the METC in initial software configuration and data loading, Customization of the COTS product shall be limited to modification necessary to configure and tailor the application to METCs unique operating environment.  <BR>Upon the successful conclusion of the base period, the METC envisions that additional requirements will include future integration with existing system such as RITM (Resident Individual Training Management), ATTRS (Army Training Requirements and Resources System), TDC (Training Development Capability) and Blackboard (Learning Management System).  Since no two METC organizations are completely alike in their requirements, the system must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to fulfill future potential needs.<BR>Phased Approach.  It is desired that a three-phased approach be followed. This will allow the METC to evaluate its training workflow in the context of an automated system, refine its logistics processes and implement the enterprise solution.  In all three phases outlined below, the vendor will work with the government representative to propose alternative approaches based on Best Business practices (BBPs) that will allow change requirements to be implemented expeditiously throughout the Period of Performance without significant impacts or project cost.  Weekly meetings with the vendor are required to evaluate, approve, and prioritize enhancement requests. METCs preferred method of software customization will be agile development. Agile development will allow the METC to forge ahead at a rapid pace while providing adequate opportunity to reprioritize modifications as necessary.<BR>PHASE I  Initial Implementation (12 months).  During the initial implementation phase, the vendor will provide the turnkey system (hardware, software, professional services, hosting, training and support, backup and disaster recovery) to implement the system and automate initial METC courses (approximately 2,600 soldiers trained in 2010).  A successful implementation will include loading the necessary POIs (with associated resources, facilities and personnel) and those courses automatically being scheduled by the software via web-configurable business rules.  During the course of implementation, the vendor will document all functional requirements and workflows for these courses in order to support further implementation of the system. <BR>PHASE II  Enterprise implementation (12 months).  Upon successful completion of Phase I, the vendor will be required to travel to Ft. Sam Houston and deliver a formal In Process Review (IPR) to the Project Manager (PM)/Configuration Control Board (CCB) detailing project status, lessons learned and a methodical Phase II implementation strategy.  Given the operational tempo at METC, the PM/CCB will work with the vendor to develop an implementation plan that minimizes organizational disruption during system deployment.  In addition, at the direction of the METC TPOC the vendor will provide the following training classes to designated METC scheduling personnel:<BR><BR>1.	Data load workshop (1 week)<BR>2.	Onsite Classroom Training(1 week/20 students)<BR>3.	Custom Webcast Training<BR>4.	Train the Trainer class (2 weeks/25 students)<BR>5.	Support and Maintenance<BR><BR>PHASE III  Operations and Maintenance (24 months).  Once fully implemented, the system will move to an Operations and Maintenance phase.  The vendor will be required to provide ongoing hosting, help desk support, software patches, upgrades and server administration as well as ongoing support and training.<BR>Period of Performance.  The Period of Performance (PoP) will be for one base year from the date of contract award with three 1-year contract options.  The implementation, outlined in Phase 1 must be concluded no later than twelve months from the date of the contract award.<BR>Contract work location. Work performed in accordance with this PWS shall be at Fort Sam Houston, TX and at off-site contractor facilities.  Systems analysis for modifications, data load, and training will be completed both on and off site as directed by the COR.  Software modifications will be performed primarily off-site at contractor facilities.  <BR><BR>1.1 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. <BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement solely for information and planning purposes it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

The format for this justification is from the FAR part 6.303-2 and presented in the format prescribed.1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "justification for other than full and open competition."Agency: U.S. Department of Veterans AffairsContracting Activity: Contracting Officer (90C) Central Texas Veterans Health Care System 1901 Veterans Memorial Drive. Temple, Texas   765042. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  The contractor shall provide an Isolated Heart for Small Rodent (IH-SR) System to CTVHCS. The Contracting Officer intends to award this procurement to Harvard Apparatus. 3. A description of the supplies or services required in order to meet the agencies needs (including the estimated value). The procurement of an apparatus, Isolated Rodent - Small Heart, to work on retrograde perfusion under constant pressure or constant flow conditions with extension cell isolation.  This apparatus provides the Cardiovascular Research Institute necessary equipment to continue its work. This is being procured for the Cardiovascular Research Institute located at the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, Temple, TX  76504. The government estimates $32,470.00 to procure this apparatus.4.

The apparatus has the integrated ability to measure Left Ventricle Pressure (LVP) and Pressure-Volume.  Additionally, the contractor has demonstrated reputable past performance.  As a result, it was decided to be in the best interest of the government to acquire this apparatus from this contractor. 6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. There will be no solicitations for other offorers. The equipment consists of a proprietary, patented apparatus to enable researchers to work on retrograde perfusion under constant pressure or constant flow conditions with extension cell isolation. 7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. This requirement is a sole source to Harvard Apparatus, a Small Business. The offorers proposed price will be determined fair and reasonable  IAW FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii) comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items.8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Market research was conducted utilizing the internet. The research was conducted through GSA identifying two vendors providing similar apparatuses, which would not satisfy the customers requirement.   The Small Business Administration s Dynamic Small Business Search Engine was queried to identify any service disabled veteran owned and /or veteran owned small business entities utilizing NAICS code 334516. The result of this query produced 172 vendors none of which could provide the same or similar type apparatus, due to its proprietary nature. Therefore this procurement is being set aside for Harvard Apparatus, a Small Business. 9. Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition. None10. A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.None11. A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. None for this procurement.12.

<DESC>The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, intends to solicit and award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Accumet Materials, Co. for 12,000 lbs of High Density Tungsten Powder under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The North American Industry Classification System for this acquisition is 332117, small business size standard: 500 people. Interested parties may submit their capabilities package to the email address below. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals/quotes. However, the government will consider all responses received within 5 days of publication. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Questions shall be submitted electronically to lesa.white@eglin.af.mil and scott.florkey@eglin.af.mil .
<p>Requirement includes 12,000 lbs of High Density Tungsten Powder, product number HD-LLNL2N5100-200. -100+200 mesh with APS of 112 microns.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING IS JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY<br />This is for the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition on the purchasing of 12,000lbs of tungsten powder material.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br />Individual J&amp;A for new acquisition under a Government Purchase Order; firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS<br />This acquisition is for the purchase of 12,000 lbs of Tungsten Powder, (-100 + 200 mesh, quote #: 200910274, part #: HD/LLNL2N5100-200). This purchase will support the loading operations necessary to support the AFRL/RWME work order to fill 100 FLM assets for the 681st ARSS. Accumet is the recommended source as their material; meets particle size requirements, purity requirements and was successfully demonstrated in the last 2 years as part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precision Lethality Munitions Program. Use of any other vendor will require the candidate chosen for use in this program to be requalified at the cost of $750K per explosive formulation, and 12 month schedule slip, hence jeopardizing AFRL/RWME's ability to meet system readiness dates.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source).</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />FAR 6.302-1 provides for a sole source award in the case of unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br />In the past, AFRL/RWME has attempted to utilize Tungsten material provided by Kulite and Teledyne. In most cases, despite the 99% purity, these materials have contained known/unknown trace impurities which cause material compatibility failures in ~75% of all formulation batches produced. To date, RWME researchers have been unable to identify the root cause for failures with these materials. By comparison, RWME has produced nearly 6000 lbs of Tungsten based explosive formulations in over 200 mixing operations without a single material failure, when using Accumet material.<br />Given material failures associated with previous material procured from Teledyne and Kulite, extensive resources have been divested to research and have yet to determine the cause of these failures, and would require additional resources to characterize these failures. Historical data has determined that Accumet is the only vendor capable of providing this material. As Tungsten is highly influenced by the commodity market, and the rapidly changing world market conditions the price of future material cannot be accurately predicted.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION<br />See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED<br />This is expected to be a one-time buy. Thus, further steps to foster competition are not required at this time.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).<br />NOTE: <br />1. Before definitizing a not-to-exceed (NTE) option, the contracting officer must ensure that the effort covered by the NTE option has been synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and a J&amp;A that covers the effort has been approved. (See AFFARS 5317.207).</p>

Only one property, the MROTC, is able to satisfy 76 AMXG's needs as described in section IV which are essentially to support weapon system requirements without jeopardizing the individual weapon system PDM efforts. The MROTC is the only facility with sufficient high Bay space, proximity to the base, and has the industrial infrastructure to meet 76 AMXG's requirements.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFQ).   

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 325413, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This solicitation is posted 100% small business set-aside for all qualified small businesses and will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has requested the purchase of the following items:

Brand Name or Equal (DSM Premitest B.V.)

001: 1 Kit, Premitest Salmonella Kit (38220000) - The Premi® Test Salmonella is a DNA-based rapid method for the confirmation and serotyping of presumptive Salmonella spp.  Starting from purified, presumptive Salmonella isolates, the Premi® Test Salmonella confirms whether the isolate belongs to the Salmonella genus and based on genetic profiling allocates the Salmonella enterica serotype for the most commonly encountered serovars (i.e. at present 94 serovars taken up in the software database of the Premi® Test Salmonella). The 94 serovars are a subset of the over 2500 Salmonella serovars which are taken up in the Kaufmann-White scheme. The Kaufman-White scheme is a scoring scheme of antigenic formulae which is adopted by the World Health Organization and which requires at least three antibody-antigen reactions (as described in ISO 6579) to identify a particular Salmonella strain to an established serotype name.

The PremiTest is currently undergoing AOAC RI and ISO validation.  FDA can only use validated methods for the analysis of regulatory isolates. 

The following are the specifications for the PremiTest:

1. It is a molecular method (PCR) for the identification of specific Salmonella serotypes.

2. The test can be performed in less than 10 h.


3. It can currently correctly identify 94 different serotypes. Any other serotype, not within the database, is correctly identified as being Salmonella.
4. The database is expandable and will be expanded over time, so we will not be restricted to just 94 serotypes in the future.

Yellowstone National Park requires repair of 216 - 300 foot gill nets as listed in Scope of Work.   Quoted price is firm fixed and should include return shipping of nets to the Mammoth Supply Center, Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park  WY  82190.  Nets will be shipped to awarded vendor as soon as possible after award.  Delivery needed by April 2010.   The following is a description of the requirements:
SCOPE OF WORKGill net repair
BACKGROUNDThe National Park Service (NPS) has an intensive lake trout removal program in place on Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park.  The main type of gear used in this effort is gill nets.  These nets suffer a great amount of wear and tear through normal use and the park currently has 186 300-ft gill nets in need of repair.  Another 30 nets have been stripped of mesh and are in need of new mesh and float line.  
PURPOSEThis Scope of Work has been developed in order to have 216 300-ft gillnets repaired or rehung and returned to new condition for future use.
WORK DETAILSThe NPS will ship or deliver the nets in need of repair or rehanging to the successful bidder.  Although condition of the nets varies greatly, most nets will require that the majority of mesh be stripped from the lead and float lines and replaced with new mesh material.  In most instances, lead line will not need replacing.  It is expected about half of the float lines will also need to be replaced or restrung with deep-water floats.  The repaired nets must be in new condition and constructed according to the specifications listed below.  Overall quotation must include cost of delivery of the repaired nets to Yellowstone National Park by April 2010.
GILLNET SPECIFICATIONSLead Line  All nets have been constructed with either 30-, 40-, or 50-lb lead core.  These lines are in good to excellent shape and very little of this will need replacing.  In cases where lead lines require splicing, all splicing must be finished with no rough edges so as to prevent meshes from catching.Float Line  Nylon,  poly foam float, or  polypropylene lines (e.g. Starbrite or Grass meter), constructed with plastic deep water corks.  Current condition of the float lines on these nets is poor to good due to wear and tear from normal use and occasional excessive stretching of the line when improperly retrieved.  Lines should be replaced if not in good condition with  polypropylene lines.  In instances where deep water corks are not present, they must be added.Bridle Construction  same as float line (either  poly foam float line or  polypropylene) with short phrases (9 in or less) to minimize tear out and twisting.  To facilitate efficient and simple means of ganging multiple nets, bridles must have ears (looped float and lead lines) at each end.Seaming twine  9 thread tarred/coatedPhrase Length  Phrase length must be short (9 in or less) to minimize floats entangling in mesh, to keep meshes close to lead and float lines, and to ensure proper hanging when deployed.  All meshes must be hung on a double selvage and hung on  basis.Nets must be delivered in tubs, with up to 3 nets per tub.  Tubs should be of a light-weight material for easy handling and storage with dimensions of 36 in x 24 in x 8 in.
Majority of nets will be repaired using monofilament twine.  However, 3-strand twisted multifilament polypropylene (MFP) must be used as specified below.
The following combination of mesh sizes, twine sizes, and numbers of each are requested, but may be negotiable.  In cases where not all mesh needs to be replaced, a mesh of equivalent twine size and type should be used.  However, it is likely the majority of nets will require replacement of all mesh.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.<br />(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Recovery Initiatives (ORI) is a new office in USAID Sudan that will replace and expand on the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). The ORI will serve as an operating unit within the USAID Mission to help local partners advance peace and democracy in Sudan. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, ORI will work on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition and recovery needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition while emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional relief or development assistance. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or failed transition. ORI will assist in securing peace in Sudan by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. ORI will use such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about the USAID Sudan Mission and its programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/locations/sub-saharan_africa/countries/sudan/index.html</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Office of Recovery Initiatives (ORI) is a new office in USAID Sudan that will replace and expand on the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). The ORI will serve as an operating unit within the USAID Mission to help local partners advance peace and democracy in Sudan. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, ORI will work on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition and recovery needs.</p>
<p>ORI's Sudan program is an integral part of the U.S. Government's effort to strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability. The ORI program will be implemented within the framework of both the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and other viable and internationally supported peace agreements. ORI will assume management of three OTI implementing partners in Sudan: AECOM International Sudan (AIS), Academy for Educational Development (AED), and ACORD. Through these implementing partners, the ORI program will implement activities with the following objectives: 1) supporting emerging civil and local authorities at the state and local levels; 2) promoting engagement of civil society in support of peace processes and dialogue with civil authorities; and 3) increasing availability of high-quality and independent information on transition issues. Additional objectives, programming approaches and partners may be identified to meet USAID Sudan's recovery assistance strategy in Sudan.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the warranty length and clarify the contract award criteria. This is not a request for offerors to amend their offers. Upon further research and analysis, the Government found that no company offers a 10 year warranty for their adjustable exam tables. Given this information, the Government will accept an exam table that has a minimum warranty of 1 year. The contract for the adjustable exam tables will be awarded to the offeror who has the lowest price and whose product conforms to the salient characteristics previously listed in the original solicitation posting.

New DOD requirements for wood packaging material (WPM) have been developed in response to international implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization protocol on International Standards for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) 15. ISPM 15 is designed to block movement of pests that can destroy forests from one nation to another. DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo. (For more information, see the American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated Web page at http://www.alsc.org.) The new WPM requirements will be reflected in DLA solicitations and awards issued on or after August 1, 2006. WPM is defined in the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material. (Note that DOD does not endorse the Methyl Bromide Fumigation Program. Only heat treatment or kiln dried heat treatment of WPM are authorized.) After August 1, 2006, contractors can be held accountable for taking corrective action on noncompliant shipments.

DSCP has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page.

More Veterans ? A:  Increased workload and mandated facility design changes.Q:  Does the present Behavioral Health facility function for them ?  If not, what is missing ?  A:  Current facility has undergone several renovations but has not been renovated to extent that flow has been sufficiently addressed.Q:  Is Behavioral Health offering any new services?  A:  The facility is interested in moving toward an intensive outpatient program - current barriers to this include sufficient space to hold group sessions along with expanded restroom and other support facilities.Q:  What has changed since the current Behavioral Health Building was upgraded?A:  Some projections suggest that Pennsylvania will have more returning Reserve Component veterans in the next several years.Q:  Are we permitted to make a site visit to see Building No. 5 and the proposed site for replacement of this building?  A:  Opportunity for a site visit will be provided to the firm(s) that is selected to begin negotiations with the VA for this project.

A presentation providing general information regarding the program will be given by a number of key personnel.  There will be a brief time allotted for questions and answers.

The FMS Supportability Program Industry Day presentation will be held in a room with limited conference space, therefore prospective offerors are requested to limit the number of attendees.

As part of your response please provide the names of the individuals from your organization who will be attending.

In addition, NAVSEA wishes to provide potential offerors an advance opportunity to identify potential organizational conflicts of interest as set forth in the Section L clause of the draft RFP entitled "NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST (NAVSEA) (JUN 1994)", and submit mitigation plans if necessary so that any issues which may arise can be addressed as early in the acquisition process as possible, in accordance with the guidance at FAR 9.504.

<DESC><p>September 25, 2009: CHANGE - Uplaoding Phase One Request for Qualifications package.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 10 announces an opportunity for the Modernization of Jackson Federal Building, Seattle Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC><p>October 16, 2009: CHANGE - Uploading Amendment 03 to RFQ Package.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Ocotber 15, 2009: CHANGE - Uploading Amendment 02 to RFQ Package.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />October 9, 2009: CHANGE - Uploading Amendment 01 to RFQ Package. <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />September 25, 2009: CHANGE - Uplaoding Phase One Request for Qualifications package.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 10 announces an opportunity for the Modernization of Jackson Federal Building, Seattle Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms.
