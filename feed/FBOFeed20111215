<DESC><p>The AAC/EBDZ/EBDK, Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) Program Office, Eglin AFB FL, is contemplating issuing a Sole Source Award to Kaman Precision Products, Inc., in Orlando, FL. This effort is to procure and receive additional spares to support currently fielded FMU 152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) systems. Specifically, these spares include the following items and approximate quantities: FZU-55A/B Bomb Fuze Initiators, 400 each, FZU-63/B Bomb Fuze Initiators, 200 each, Closure rings, 50 each, Power Cables, 200 each, and Setscrews, 1,000 each. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) Program Office conducted a competitive source selection in FY11 for the award of a JPF Follow-on Production contract for delivery of an initial Lot of JPF systems plus 6 optional Lots on an annual basis. That source selection resulted in a single offer being presented for consideration. A contract award is pending at this time. This action represents a small quantity of items necessary to assure continuous deliveries to the warfighter during the start-up period under that contract.</p>
<p>The FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) is a cockpit-selectable bomb fuze employed in MK-80 series warheads (both guided and unguided variations), and both the 2000lb and 5000lb series Penetrator warheads. The FMU-152A/B fuze system consists of the fuze, the FZU-55A/B fuze initiator and the FZU-63A/B fuze initiator, a closure ring, and power cable. Spares for the fuze system would consist of the FZU-55A/B initiator, the FZU-63A/B initiator, power cable, closure ring, and a small variety of sub-tier components. The government intends to solicit and negotiate this effort with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Interested parties must submit statements of capability (SOC) or capabilities package addressing the following: (1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the Joint Programmable Fuze (FMU-152A/B) requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for JDAM and other guided munitions/general purpose bombs, interface requirements for required US and Allied aircraft, and system safety requirements; (2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble spares in support of the fuze (FMU-152A/B) as listed above, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; (3) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble the fuze initiator (FZU-55A/B and FZU-63A/B) and power cable, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; (4) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of fuze initiators in accordance with Contractor-developed and Government approved plans; (5) Ability to deliver spares on schedule (3 months after contract award). Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package. Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 45 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1. The NAIC Code/Size Standards is 332995/500 employees. <br /><br />Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting Statements of Capability to produce and deliver FMU152A/B spares. Deliveries are expected to occur 3 months after contract award. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all statements of capability received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The primary Ombudsman is Col David A. Harris, AAC/CV located at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495, phone number (850) 882-5422, DSN 872-5422.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Interested sources should contact Ms. Trisha Brinton, Contract Specialist, 850-883-1248, Trisha.Brinton@eglin.af.mil or Ms. Leanne T. Green, 850-883-0902, Leanne.Green@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>Contracting Office:Department of the Air Force, Electronic Systems Center, ESC/HIK, 200 East Moore Drive, Maxwell Air Force Base - Gunter Annex, Alabama 36114-3000 and ESC/HGGI Maintenance Branch has a Brand Name requirement for purchase of Teamcenter Software and maintenance agreement for 12 months of coverage.  "This is a not solicitation/request for quote". 
Acquisition Description: This is a notice of the Government's intent to award on a sole source basis new contract for continued maintenance of the Product Lifecycle Management System (PLMS) program."  This requirement will close on 19 Dec 2011 at 4pm Central Standard Time (CST). All submissions should be e-mailed to ronald.tanner@gunter.af.mil. An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and the resulting contract. The ESC Ombudsman is the ESC Director, Commander's Staff, and can be contacted at: ESC/DS Bldg 1606 9 Eglin Street Hanscom AFB, MA 01731; Telephone #: 781-377-5106; Facsimile #: 781-377-4659; E-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil. For specific questions, ! please contact Mr. Ron Tanner, Contract Specialist, at ronald.tanner@gunter.af.mil or (334) 416-5549 or Ms. Sharon F. Stallings, Contracting Officer, at sharon.stallings@gunter.af.mil or (334) 416-1659. 
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION FOR annual maintenance support is based on the fact that the ESC/HGGI PLMS Program Management Office relies on Teamcenter Software as the foundational software product on which the PLMS application operates.  This software is essential to the program's requirements and therefore the maintenance of such software is essential to the Government's requirements.  Any change to the PLMS baseline that does not include Teamcenter software would create unacceptable delays to integrate new products into the LMS application and result in increased costs to the government.

<p>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation<br />Paying Agent (PA) Services Synopsis</p>
<p>PBGC disburses about 800,000 benefit payments each month totaling above $5 billion annually to retirees in over 4,000 terminated private-sector single-employer defined benefit pension plans. PBGC is seeking the most cost-effective Paying Agent (PA) solution that the market has to offer subject to identified PBGC constraints (e.g. organizational structure, risk profile, system limitations, file formats, business processes). PA services are overseen by the Benefits Payment Branch (BPB) of the Retiree Services Division (RSD) within the Benefits Administration and Payments Department (BAPD). PBGC maintains its own pension recordkeeping system for over 1.5 million participants. That system packages payment changes (adds and updates) and transmits them to the PA's pension payment system several times each month.<br /><br />Services sought include the following (activities flagged with * indicate an opportunity for departure, or potential departure from historical practices, bracketed numbers indicate fiscal year (Oct-Sept) 2011 volumes:<br /><br />&bull; Perform all services in observable compliance with: <br />o The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), associated National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (e.g. 800-37, 800-60, 800-53, 800-53A, 800-137, 800-34 and other applicable NIST standards), and evolving PBGC Enterprise Information Security Office (EISO) policies and procedures including Information Security Requirements for Externally Hosted Systems. Safeguarding sensitive PBGC data (protecting its availability, confidentiality and integrity in accordance with FIPS 199/200 requirements), access controls, configuration management, contingency planning (including continuity of operations) and a rigorous continuous monitoring plan are of especially critical importance. Most of PBGC data, including data loaded into the PA's pension payment system, requires NIST 800-53 controls required of moderate risk systems. The required high-level process is as follows. It is expected that after contract award, items 1 - 6 will be completed before the PA's pension payment system can go live with PBGC data:<br />1. Define the control environment of the PA's pension payment system<br />2. Assess the adequacy of the control environment against NIST 800-53 controls<br />3. Document the gaps<br />4. Develop plan of actions and milestones (POA&amp;M) to close the gaps<br />5. Evaluate the risks of operating the system based on items 1 - 4<br />6. Decide to authorize the operation of the PA's pension payment system (or not) - A Federal Responsibility<br />7. Monitor the progress of the POA&amp;M<br />8. Continually evaluate the effectiveness of the control environment. The failure to obtain and maintain a valid system security authorization will be grounds for termination of the contract.<br />o A sound system of internal controls as evidenced by, among other things, annual SSAE No. 16 (formerly SAS 70) covering internal control over all operations associated with PBGC benefit payments including any services performed by sub-service organizations (e.g. subcontractors/joint ventures for outsourced IT, print/mail, tax, check image services).<br /><br />&bull; Support PBGC audits including those sponsored by PBGC's Inspector General (see for example the report on internal controls at http://oig.pbgc.gov) [In FY11 this included 8 full days at contractor sites]. <br /><br />&bull; Disburse benefit payments to PBGC payees via EFT PPD [7 million] &amp; IAT* [0] entries and paper checks [2 million]. Payments include:<br />o Monthly annuities [9 million], back payments [32,000]. and other payments payable on the first of the month;<br />o Lump sum distributions [13,000] and other payments *weekly [2,200].<br />o Unique-situation payments [1,600 Fleming, 57 Page-Collins settlement, 0 Rettig/SID settlement (last was 12/2009) payments]<br /><br />&bull; Calculate, withhold, remit to IRS &amp; report to IRS &amp; to PBGC payees federal income taxes (not state income taxes)<br /><br />&bull; Withhold and remit PBGC-approved IRS levies and a limited number of medical/life deductions to support unique agreements (~4,000 payees in several steel plans).<br /><br />&bull; Maintain PBGC sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), on contractor-owned pension payment system hosted within the United States and accessible only to authorized employees from within the United States.<br /><br />&bull; Continue recurring payments until PBGC transmits a change (recurring payments are mostly monthly but some quarterly, semi-annual and annual).<br /><br />&bull; Provide read-only web access to about 500 PBGC users and limited read-write access to about 10* PBGC/BPB users to the contractor's pension payment system.<br /><br />&bull; Exchange data between PBGC's benefit administration systems, including:<br />o approved payment changes from PBGC [450,000];<br />o acknowledgement of approved changes from contractor;<br />o trial balance projection from contractor;<br />o payment history (payee sub-ledgers) from contractor;<br />o NOC &amp; ACH return files from contractor;<br />o potentially tax forms (e.g. 1099-R) &amp; check images from contractor for PBGC's Image Processing System (IPS)*;<br />o potentially daily individual payee settlement data (e.g. checks that have cleared) from contractor*.<br /><br />&bull; Provide a web service for PBGC's MyPBA online self-service system (www.pbgc.gov/mypba) to serve payment history data (payee sub-ledgers) and images of checks and tax forms (e.g. 1099-R, 1042-S) to PBGC payees.<br /><br />&bull;

<DESC>Announcement:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to upgrade an existing Park Air "NOVA 9000 surface surveillance system" in Spokane, Washington.   
In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This announcement is not a screening information request (SIR) or request for proposal (RFP) of any kind.  It is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330, Engineering Services with a size standard of $4.5 million.  This is a new acquisition.
The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program based on the responses to this survey.  
Background:The FAA commenced evaluation of Low Cost Ground Surveillance (LCGS) technology at Spokane, Washington in 2005.  Park Air Systems was selected to install their commercial off the shelf system, the NOVA 9000 surface surveillance system, at Spokane for assessment.  
Purpose:The purpose of this survey is to gather information in order to determine whether there is adequate competition and to choose the procurement method for this requirement.
The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
Acquisition:The FAA currently seeks interested vendor(s) that are capable of upgrading the existing system to the product baseline equivalent of the NOVA 9000 system installed in Reno, Nevada, and upgrading the existing Terma fixed frequency radar transceiver to a new Terma Scanter 5001 solid state tunable frequency transceiver.  These two upgrades are required for continued use of the LCGS test bed at Spokane.
Draft Statement of Work:
The respondent must be able to perform the following tasks indicated below:1)	Upgrade the existing ParkAir Nova 9000 system located at the Low Cost Ground Surveillance (LCGS) test bed in Spokane Washington to the product baseline equivalent to the ParkAir Nova 9000 system delivered to Reno, NV.  This will include hardware and software upgrades.  Maintenance and warranty support will be required for a period of one year.
2)	Replace the existing Terma fixed frequency radar transceiver with a new Terma Scanter 5001 solid state tunable frequency transceiver.  Re-optimize the ParkAir Nova 9000 as required to accommodate the solid state transceiver upgrade.	Perform necessary engineering to modify the existing Terma radar equipment to comply with NTIA frequency specifications.  The equipment must be modified so that its operational frequency does not extend outside the authorized spectrum of 9.0 to 9.2 GHz.  	Upgrade the current Terma X band system with the Terma Scanter single frequency solid state transceiver.  This upgrade should include the capability for open tuning anywhere between 9.0 and 9.2 GHz.
Additional tasks may be added as required.  
Capability Statement:
All respondents must provide a Capability Statement in the submission that discusses similar work of the type, nature, and complexity completed in the past for the tasks specified in the Draft Statement of Work above.  Alternate and substitutions of equipment will not be accepted. 
Submission Procedure:
ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 2:00 PM EASTERN TIME ON JANUARY 5, 2012.  All responses must be made on company letterhead in writing and must demonstrate that the respondent can meet the requirements stated.  The responses are limited to a total of five (5) pages including the Capability Statement.  Type font of at least 12 point is required.  A Business Declaration Form (attached) should also accompany the response to this market survey.  If applicable, a copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status should be provided.
It is preferred that respondents submit their responses by electronic submission.  The electronic submission should be in either "Microsoft Word" or "PDF" formats addressed to Jerry Kim, Contract Specialist, via email at jerry.kim@faa.gov.  Please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per email message, therefore, responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received.  If a respondent chooses to mail their response, the response should be mailed to the following address:
Federal Aviation AdministrationAttn: Jerry Kim, AAQ-330800 Independence Ave., SWRoom 406Washington, DC 20591
The FAA is not required to reimburse to any party for any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a response to this market survey.  Costs associated with this market survey submission are at the sole risk of the responding party's expense.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Harlan Laboratories, Inc. for the project entitled, "Development and Maintenance of a Long Term Colony of Hybrid Rats". This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for a three year period of performance.<br /><br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) funds research programs using rodents to model aging processes and age-related diseases in humans, which require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that can be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. A continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging.<br /><br />In 2005, NIA awarded a nine year contract to develop and maintain a colony of genetically-defined aged Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats. Since contract initiation, the Contractor has acquired BN and F344 breeding stock, re-derived the stock and provided the NIA with documentation of the cesarean derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. The breeding and aging colonies have been developed and rats have been distributed to the research community as requested. Presently, the Contractor maintains a colony of approximately 22,000 rodents housed in two barriers.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to continue services that are currently being provided by Harlan Laboratories under contract number HHSN260200500006C until the renewal contract colony is fully developed and all ages are available to the research community. Rats will be maintained and provided to the research community as requested until the animals are gone or the termination date of this contract is reached, whichever comes first. The analysis requested as part of this contract will assist the NIA in determining the appropriate level of animals to maintain.&nbsp; <br /><br />Under the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 253[c](1) and FAR 6.302-1, Harlan Laboratories is the only source capable of meeting the requirements of this project.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide an analysis of shipping patterns within contract number HHSN260200500006C and continue the maintenance and distribution of a standing colony of aged, genetically defined BN and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats for use by investigators in studies of aging while the renewal contract colony is being developed. This colony must be maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where the animals are monitored and characterized for diseases status and markers of genetic purity. The development of the colony required acquisition of foundation stock, re-derivation of the stock to ensure that the animals conformed to the required health status, and development of the breeding colonies. This phase takes approximately three (3) years. Animals are entered into the aging colony monthly so that there is a continuous supply available.<br /><br />The NIA seeks to maintain the existing colony until the renewal contract colony has all ages available for the research community.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Charles River Laboratories, Inc. for the project entitled, "Development and Maintenance of a Multigenotypic Caloric Restricted Rodent Colony". This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for a four-year performance period.
<p>The Development and Maintenance of a Multigenotypic Caloric Restricted Rodent Colony is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii).</p>
<p>Presently, Charles River Laboratories houses these rodents in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For these reasons, the existing colony cannot be transferred to a new Contractor.</p>
<p>If another contractor were to be awarded this contract, the entire technological infrastructure would need to be developed. The environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination preclude the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. It would take 3-4 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the caloric restriction aging colony. The research funded by the NIA requires a consistent supply of aged rodents and a 3-4 year gap in availability of the animals would have a serious effect on NIA-funded studies. The Charles River Laboratories has the unique capability to provide the required services to NIA for the Development and Maintenance of a Multigenotypic Caloric Restricted Rodent Colony.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />Contract HHSN260200400003C was awarded in 2004 to develop and maintain a colony of genetically-defined calorically-restricted rat and mouse strains, for a 9-year period. Since contract initiation, the Contractor has acquired breeding stock for two inbred strains of mice and two inbred strains of rats, re-derived the stock and provided the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) with documentation of the cesarean derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. The breeding and aging colonies have been developed for one inbred mouse strain, one hybrid mouse strain, one inbred rat strain and one hybrid rat strain, and animals have been distributed to the research community as requested. Presently, the Contractor maintains a colony of approximately 3,000 rodents housed in two barriers.<br />The purpose of this follow-on sole source award is to continue services that are currently being provided by the Charles River Laboratories until the renewal contract colony is fully developed and all ages are available to the research community. Breeding in HHSN260200400003C will cease when the renewal contract colony begins entering into the caloric restriction aging colony, but the colony in HHSN260200400003C will be maintained and provided to the research community as requested until the animals are gone or the termination date of this extension is reached, whichever comes first. <br />OBJECTIVE(S): The colony under contract number HHSN260200400003C was developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.</p>
<p>The objectives of this contract requirement are to 1) analyze shipping patterns in contract number HHSN260200400003C; 2) cryopreserve embryos from the rat strains in contract number HHSN260200400003C; and 3) maintain and distribute the standing colony of aged, genetically defined, calorically restricted rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging until the renewal contract colony is ready to distribute all ages. <br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Breeding Colony Maintenance; B) Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; C) Feeding Protocol; D) Environmental Requirements; E) Colony Evaluation and Monitoring; and F) Shipment of Animals to Investigators.<br />REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: A. Semiannual Progress Reports; B. Weekly Census Reports; C. Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports; D. Reports of the results of the semiannual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies; E. Postmortem Reports; and F. Final Report.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 1122990 with $.75 Million.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHSNIHNIDA(AG)-RDSS-12-164 and HHSNIHNIDA(AG)-SBSS-12-164.</p>
<p>The estimated contract award date will be on or about August 2012.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) provides ocean engineering program management and technical services to the U.S. Navy for matters regarding seafloor geotechnical engineering.  This announcement seeks out laboratory test results and a preliminary analytical framework such that uncertainties in estimating soil strength from the results of geophysical tests can be quantified and reduced.

This task is part of a larger project titled No-Touch Geophysical Strength Properties for Navy Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Systems. It is relevant to note is that several sensors currently provide limited geotechnical information without requiring direct contact with the seafloor.
  Sub-Bottom Profiling, swath bathymetry, electro-resistivity, seismic refraction, and electromagnetic sensors are all examples of these techniques, several which are frequently utilized with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). As site specific correlations between soil strength and various geophysical measurements can be achieved, the preliminary controlled laboratory study requested is intended to highlight variability in these correlations for a range of geotechnical materials anticipated to be encountered in the upper 5 m of the seafloor. 

This announcement seeks out laboratory results and a preliminary analytical framework that can be used to assess the magnitude and uncertainty in geotechnical properties (e.g., void ratio, soil strength) estimated from the results of offshore geophysical surveys.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies used to autonomously collect geotechnical data and use it to deduce geotechnical properties of the seafloor.  This data must be collected without direct physical interface to the seafloor in the specific mission area of interest.  It is assumed that the sensor utilized will not require a physical interface with the seafloor.   

Note that this announcement seeks a demonstration and proof of concept that would best satisfy the performance requirements.  Said demonstration would not require development of a self-contained prototype capable of being utilized in the field; only demonstration of a working instrument that collects and processes the data to provide the required geotechnical information.
    

Geophysical properties to be collected include: surface sediment classification, layering of sediments up to five meters below the surface, porosity, consistency, and a reasonable estimate of drained and un-drained soil shear strength.

This technology or methodology would ultimately be operated aboard a NAVY shipboard environment.  The term shipboard environment is meant to encompass operations from Navy, Military Sealift Command (MSC), and commercial platforms.  The term autonomously collect is used to signify that the system should be stand-alone, with the potential to be deployed as a module aboard an AUV or ROV system.

<p>The Department of Homeland Security intends to make 2-3 firm-fixed price contract awards to contractors that will demonstrate their Wide Area Aerial Surveillance System (WAASS), in an operational environment. The contractors will demonstrate their airborne WAASS capability in a land-border environment to be determined by DHS S&amp;T, via flight testing. The emphasis of this program initiative is on technical performance in an operational environment. Specific threshold and objective requirements will be provided in the RFP. The system demonstrated shall fit within the size, weight and power parameters of a CBP Lockheed Orion P-3 aircraft or a General Atomics Predator B Unmanned Aerial System aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to provide a technical description that presents existing or expected performance characteristics/capabilities for key components of the technology to be flown that will be responsive to the requirements in the resultant RFP. The contractor will be required to submit proof of insurance in response to the request for proposal. The insurance requirements are as follows: FAR 28.307-2(d), " Aircraft public and passenger liability. ...Coverage shall be at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other than passenger liability, and $200,000 per occurrence for property damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury shall be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is greater."</p>
<p>The primary objective of WAASS is to provide persistent, long-term surveillance over urban and rural terrain at least the size of 16 km2. The surveillance system shall have an electro-optical capability for daylight missions but can have an infrared capability for day or night operations. The sensor shall integrate with an airborne platform for data gathering. The imagery data shall be displayed at a DHS operations center and have the capability for forensic analysis within 36 hours of the flight.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. It is anticipated that the draft solicitation will be issued electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about January 9, 2012.

Paper copies of the draft solicitation or final request for proposal will not be available.</p>
<p>The Government intends to use FAR Part 15 procedures for this competition. Award will be made on the basis of best value to the Government. The place of performance shall be the contractor's facilities and a land-border environment to be determined by DHS S&amp;T.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The United States General Services Administration seeks Expressions of Interest for Lease of Office and Related Space in Suburban Maryland.&nbsp; This requirement is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which currently occupies office and related space in a campus of buildings under lease in Silver Spring, Maryland, that will be expiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The United States Government is seeking to lease approximately 986,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space in no more than four buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LOCATION: The delineated area is Suburban Maryland, within 2,640 walkable linear feet of a metrorail station.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: The proposed lease is for a 15-year firm term.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: The space must be available for occupancy by May 1, 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.&nbsp; The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.&nbsp; In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration.&nbsp; Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction.&nbsp; In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest shall be submitted to the Government's Broker Representative at the following address:</p>
<p>Henry Chapman<br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc.<br />8270 Greensboro Drive, Suite 620<br />McLean, VA 22102<br />Henry.chapman@cbre.com<br />Telephone: 703-288-2565</p>
<p>A copy shall also be sent to:<br />GSA National Capital Region<br />1099 14th Street, NW<br />Room 300 East<br />Washington, DC 20005<br />Attention: Brian MacDonald<br />&nbsp;<br />Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />3. ANSI/BOMA office area/usable square feet (USF);<br />4. Rentable square feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per usable square foot, full service inclusive of a Tenant Improvement Allowance of $45.59/ANSI BOMA office area SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />5.

<p>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing a hemispherical electron analyzer system for analysis of thin films made by pulsed laser ablation. It is well known that thin films made from pulsed laser deposition (PLD) have been shown to retain the same chemical composition in the film as the target. In order to check the composition of these films surface analysis techniques such as X-ray Photoelectron, Auger Electron, and Ultra-Violet Photoelectron Spectroscopies are necessary. Each technique yields important information concerning the chemistry of the sample. All these techniques measure the kinetic energy of electrons under various conditions through the use of electron analyzer. Contractors responding should specify that their equipment meets the specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance. Additionally, sales history, including recent commercial companies sold to should be included to determine commerciality.</p>
<p>The required specifications for one (1) electron analyzer should satisfy the following requirements:<br />(1) Resolution below 1eV.<br />(2) Hemispherical Geometry<br />(3) Dynamic spectra acquisition capabilities w/ minimal loss in resolution<br />a.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI, and is in no way obligated by the information received.<br><br>1.0 SCOPE:<br><br> Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<br><br>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain technical and cost information from manufacturers regarding the availability of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government-off -the- Shelf (GOTS) modular compact aerostat and airship payload deployment units. The purpose of this aerostat/airship platform system is to obtain potential solutions to provide small tactical units with an Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability. Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will be considered. <br><br>This requirement includes operators and Field Service Representatives (FSRs) to provide FSR support and new equipment training.   The aerostat/airship shall provide for remote, safe, persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance.  The aerostat/airship must stay on station even in less favorable environmental conditions that would ground a tethered or untethered unit of comparable size, features, or classification.<br><br>The platform shall have a capability for Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL).  The platform shall be a lighter than air (LTA) platform that is easily deployable in either a mobile (untethered) or tethered state.  The Airship shall remain functional while flying even in non-ideal conditions.  The Airship must fly in winds up to, but not less than, 25 knot winds.  The system shall be deployable utilizing no more than two Soldiers.  The Airship shall have an active onboard systems ("smart aerostat") its fins will continue to use their movable surfaces to stabilize and trim the aerostat/airship, safety systems will prevent fly always in the event that the tether line was cut.<br><br>Mechanically, the Airship platform shall incorporate a modular design for ease of manufacturing and flexible payload configuration.  The configurable sensor pod can house a wide array of active or passive sensing devices.

<p>This Sources Sought Announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes only - there is no actual requirement or any further information available at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DLA Disposition Services is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses to this Announcement are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Announcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All costs associated with responding to this Announcement will be solely at the responding party's expense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All information received in response to this Announcement that is marked as proprietary information will be handled accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The DLA Disposition Services is conducting market research to determine the capabilities and qualifications of businesses in the continental United States to potentially perform compliant demilitarization by recycling and smelting for metals recovery of various types of non CRT electron tubes. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If a contract is eventually pursued, magnetrons and klystrons may also be offered if the contractor has the capability to compliantly and safely remove dielectric fluids and gases in non-air cooled models prior to destructive processes.</p>
<p>Purpose of this Announcement is to (1) identify compliant recyclers capable of recycling non-CRT electron tubes via smelting while safely managing the hazardous components these tubes may contain such as lead, cadmium, mercury, ceramics containing beryllium, and dielectric gases or fluids (magnetrons and klystrons) and in the event a contract is pursued, to (2) meet demilitarization storage, handling and verification requirements during the receipt, storage, processing of DEMIL required electron tubes and to (3) recover ferrous, non-ferrous and precious metals.</p>
<p>Quantities generated vary annually depending on the needs of the military services. An average of 22,000 electron tubes required DEMIL each year between 2005 and 2010. Weights of individual tubes ranged from a few ounces<span><del datetime="2011-12-15T11:02" cite="mailto:Tracy%20Marie%20Hart"> </del></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>to hundreds of pounds. <span><ins datetime="2011-12-15T11:02" cite="mailto:Tracy%20Marie%20Hart"></ins></span></p>
<p>The recycling process is expected to yield ferrous material, copper and copper alloys, nickel and nickel alloys, and small amounts of precious metals including silver and gold. Hazardous residue from recycling is expected to include lead, cadmium, mercury and ceramics containing beryllium. Limited TCLP testing of various types of non-CRT electron tubes identified lead and cadmium at regulated levels in some tube types and barium, chromium and silver in lesser amounts. Manufacturers identify mercury as a component of some electron tubes.</p>
<p>While the Government, in the event of a possible contract, would make every effort to identify and not ship electron tubes containing non-regulated low level alpha and beta emitting radioactive components, the recycler would need a process to screen electron tubes at the time of receipt and during any destructive processes for radioactive components using multiple techniques including radiation monitors and visual examination of tubes and packaging for indication of radioactive sources. Electron tubes identified with any radioactive components during screening processes would be returned to the Government prior to any destructive processing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The following table provides examples of non-CRT electron tubes that may require demilitarization via recycling and smelting. This list is only provided to demonstrate the diversity in the types of non-CRT electron tubes that may be offered for recycling and smelting. There are over 10,000 different unique electron tubes identified via a national stock number in DOD inventories. This listing is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily represent all types of non-CRT electron tubes that may require DEMIL via recycling:</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.
Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request  for Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Central Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated to apply to this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $18.5 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options anticipated to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C. Taylor II, Contract Specialist, at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov.no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.  
The FAA plans to publish responses to questions on January 18, 2012, and host a teleconference with interested parties on January 19, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Due to the limited availability of dial in access lines, interested parties are requested to limit representation to one dial in access per company. 
Teleconference details are as follows:Dial In: 202-493-4180  Passcode: 8176
Please be advised, Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, and J.3, Facility Post Exhibits, are being distributed in a generic format.  Due to the sensitivity of the site specific information associated with Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, Sensitive Unclassified Information (SUI) will be released to the awardee.

All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Cynthia Birks, Contract Specialist, at cynthia.birks@faa.gov no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.

<DESC>PRINTING OF U.S. CHART No. 1
<p>"U.S. Chart No.1, Nautical Chart Symbols, Abbreviations and Terms" provides descriptions and depictions of the basic elements and symbols used on nautical charts published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  NOAA and NGA jointly produce the document.  U.S. Chart No. 1 also shows the "INT1" symbols described in the "Regulations of the IHO for International (INT) Charts and Chart Specifications of the IHO" published by the International Hydrographic Organization.  It is an essential aid for new chart users and a useful reference for all mariners.</p>
<p>The latest version, Edition 11, is now available for free download from the Internet.  Preparations for Edition 12 are already underway and release to the public is anticipated by the end of 2012. Edition 12 will feature the addition of the symbols specified by the IHO for the portrayal of Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) data on Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS).</p>
<p>The NOAA Office of Coast Survey wants to facilitate the printing and public sale of paper copies of U.S. Chart No. 1, Edition 11 now and potentially for new editions in the future. For that purpose the Office intends to partner with private-sector by establishing U.S. Chart 1 Publishing Agents.  A Publishing Agent will print U.S. Chart No.1 and sell it through its own network of retailers and distributors, and be compensated by its sales. No funds will be provided by the government.</p>
<p>NOAA intends to accept a limited number of U.S. Chart No.1 Publishing Agents. These agents must be sufficiently competent technically to manage, assemble, and print the U.S. Chart No.1 digital files. These partners would also have to establish a successful sales effort in order to be compensated.  U.S. Chart No.1 Publishing Agents will be provided with high resolution digital files (which are not available on the free U.S. Chart No.1 Internet download page) to use in establishing the Agents' printing, selling, and distribution capability.  Publishing agents will also be certified, their products recognized by NOAA as official copies, and the use of a certificate of authenticity will be permitted.</p>
<p>NOAA is soliciting questions and comments on its intention, on the Agent Agreement, and is also soliciting non-binding statements of interest from potential U.S. Chart No.1 Publishing Agents.  Respond by e-mail to Colby.Harmon@NOAA.gov; by fax to 301-713-4516; by letter to Colby Harmon; Office of Coast Survey, NOAA, (Mail Stop: N/CS2); 1315 East West Highway; Silver Spring, MD, 20910; or by phone to Colby Harmon, 301-713-2737 ext. 187.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE:
The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office), in conjunction with PMS 405 (Directed Energy and Electric Weapons Program Office) and the Office of Naval Research, seeking information on large-scale electrical energy storage devices for use in Navy platforms.

DESCRIPTION:
The focus of this request is to gain knowledge of the current and projected state of the art for energy storage systems (primarily battery based) as they would apply to a pulsed load for advanced weapons, while seeking to balance load requirements with what a ship may need for energy storage.  A desirable outcome of any future development effort is to have an energy storage system that meets both shipboard energy storage for fuel efficiency needs and the needs of the combat systems.
  This RFI is primarily looking at the combat systems needs, but cannot do that at the exclusion of other ship applications.  Key thresholds and objectives that will help describe the capabilities salient to this RFI include the following (in no particular order): 

Compliance to Standards:  The following standards documents comprise the expected compliances that the energy storage system would have to adhere to: MIL-S-901 Grade A (Shock), MIL-STD-167 (Shipboard Vibration), MIL-STD-882D (Safety), MIL-STD-461 (EMI), MIL-STD-810G (Environmental), and MIL-HDBK-454B (General Guidelines for Electronic Equipment). Additionally, for systems using batteries and/or other chemical energy storage media, NAVSEA TM SG270-BV-SAF-010 (NAVSEA High-Energy System Safety Manual) applies.
 For lithium bearing batteries (including lithium ion), NAVSEA INST 9310.1b (Navy Lithium Battery Safety Program) and NAVSEA TM S9310-AQ-SAF-010 (Technical Manual for Navy Lithium Battery Safety Program Responsibilities and Procedures) apply.

Calendar Service Life: Calendar service life is defined as the physical age of the energy storage system when time-induced capacity loss renders it no longer capable of either providing 80 percent of its beginning of life demonstrated energy storage ability or performing the minimum discharge profile. The threshold for calendar life is 5 years minimum. The goal is to achieve a 20 year system calendar life.

Temperature: The system should be able to perform to the other objectives while operating between 
0 degrees C (Celsius) and 65 degrees C, and withstand storage temperatures of 4 degrees C to 60 degrees C.
 Goals include operating between -10 degrees C and 86 degrees C, and withstand storage temperatures of -10 degrees C to 70 degrees C.  Cooling of 50/50 polyethylene glycol / water at 40 degrees C maximum inlet temperature may be assumed available.  The systems required cooling capacity and allowable temperature rise should be provided.  If alternative cooling liquids are proposed, MSDS and performance data for the coolant must be provided.  Coolants that pose fire, safety, health, maintenance or availability risks are highly discouraged.

Cycle Service Life: Cycle service life is defined as the number of equivalent usage cycles after which the energy storage system is no longer capable of providing 80 percent of its beginning of life demonstrated energy storage ability or of performing the minimum discharge profile.
 The threshold is to maintain acceptable margins for a minimum of 300 full discharge and charge cycles with a goal of 2000 full cycles.  

Modularity: The system should be constructed of modules appropriately sized to allow shipboard installation and maintenance. The module size should reflect a lowest replaceable unit (LRU) concept that allows for interconnectedness with other modules and an appropriate level of communication and control.  

Safety:  The Energy Storage System shall be designed for safety of the ship, its crew, and all personnel involved in shipping, loading and handling, operation, and maintenance of the system.  No single point of failure or human error shall lead to initiation of a Category I hazard (Catastrophic - defined as death, system loss, or severe damage) or Category II hazard (Critical - defined as severe injury, severe occupational illness, major system or environmental damage).
  Two or more independent faults, which may result in a Category I or II hazard, shall not be permitted unless their total probability of occurrence is less than or equal to 0.000001.  Designs should be such that a failure of one component will not propagate to other components.

Operating Voltage: The desired output voltage ranges from 650 to 1000 volts DC, with an input voltage of 450 volts ac, 3 phase.  This includes discharge and charge conditions.  Other input voltages, such as 4160 volts ac, 3 phase, may be employed on future ship installations and understanding how the technologies may be affected by changes in input voltage is of interest.

Charge Profile: The system should be capable of fully recharging within approximately 2.5 hours at a minimum charge efficiency of 90 percent using an available 450 kW (kilo-Watts) source (three phase 450 volts AC shipboard power).
  A stretch goal would be to achieve full recharge in a shorter time at higher charge efficiency.  The system should be capable of recharging from partial discharge states at the same rate in a proportional time. The stated efficiency is for the storage media only and does not include any converter system necessary for charging the storage media.

Discharge Profile: The anticipated discharge profile consists of 50 pulsed discharges of 60 MJ (Mega-Joules) with a 5-second duration, and with a discharge current profile that ranges from constant current to a ramping (sawtooth) current. The average discharge power during the pulses is 12 MW, with modular design allowing build-up to higher power levels.
 The maximum duty cycle allows for one second rest between discharge pulses.  The discharge efficiency of the energy store should be 90 percent or better.  Please specify state of charge points for initial and terminal pulse if available. A secondary application may require discharge at a higher rate (several hundred kW) for a longer time (several minutes).  The stated efficiency is for the storage media only and does not include any converter system necessary for converting stored energy to power for the load.

Volume: The entire system, including all auxiliary equipment (e.g. power converters, monitoring and control equipment, safety systems), must fit within a volume of approximately 16 cubic meters, with a maximum height of 1.85 meters.
 The volume must allow for access to the modules and other components for servicing and replacement.   

Weight:   The entire system has a threshold weight of no more than 20,000 kg, with a stretch goal of approximately 10,000 kg. Objective weight for individual modules is 90 kg, with a stretch goal of 25 kg, and should be capable of fitting through a standard hatch way of dimensions 1.6 meters high by 0.65 meters wide, with a stretch goal of a ladder trunk of 0.61 meters by 0.61 meters with radiused corners.  In addition or alternately, a constrained design for a functional string would target a storage capacity for each of 20MJ (5.6 kW-hr), and be sized to mount in a standard equipment rack.
  

RESPONSES:
PMS 320 and PMS 405 are requesting information from industry regarding concepts for an energy storage system comprised of batteries and/or other electrical energy storage media that are possibly capable of achieving the attributes described herein. Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  Information should be e-mailed to Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil and Mr. Adam Goldberg at adam.goldberg@navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum, PMS320, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376 and labeled with the solicitation number and Large-Scale Electrical Energy Storage RFI.
  Should the organizations interested in this RFI have a novel or unique concept that they wish to propose to the Navy for consideration, an opportunity to do so may be submission of a white paper in response to the open Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00024-10-R-4215 for Research and Development of Next Generation Naval Integrated Power Systems.

System Management and Control:  The response should also provide a brief description of how the proposed energy storage media would need to be protected against anomalous operations and what level of control is needed to achieve described performance goals.  If available, the architecture and basic concept of monitoring should be described.  The system must provide operation status through a standard digital communication interface.
  If available, identify optimum steady state standby charge state to maximize useful battery life.  Identify charge discharge band that maximizes lifecycle power and energy throughput. 

TRL / MRL:  The technology and manufacturing readiness levels (TRLs / MRLs) for (1) the energy storage media, (2) modules comprised of the chosen storage media and (3) the system comprised of the modules and control subsystem should be described.  Production numbers of relevant components and overall production capability are also desired.

Provide a description of how and why the system described would be capable of safe operation.  Optimally, the system design limiting failure must not damage more than 5 percent of the bank, nor prevent the operation of the remaining 95 percent.
  For storage media other than Lithium ion batteries, results of abusive and failure testing performed to date should be defined for reference.

If the energy storage system requires additional infrastructure items (e.g. heating and cooling, mounting and packaging sensitivities, temperature conditions, etc.) other than those described herein, these items should be noted in the response.  If the described storage media are not yet in production, the response should indicate when the technology and manufacturing capability would be expected to be ready. The response should also indicate which, if any, key thresholds and objectives may not be fully achievable and why.  Please also identify whether any of the identified requirements (including the specifications and standards) would make it impractical to propose a commercial or "modified" commercial system; and, if so, which requirements are the drivers.

Responses are requested by 10:00 am (EST), on December 31, 2011.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis<br /></strong>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available&nbsp;sources that exist and assess their capabilities to potentially assist the NRC with project work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this&nbsp;notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.<br /><br />The purpose of this announcement is to&nbsp;request that&nbsp;potential sources&nbsp;submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfrch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses&nbsp;are invited to submit a response to the questions below and submit the capability information as described below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged.&nbsp;The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Responses by facsimile&nbsp; to 301-492-3437 or by email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov">Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov</a> are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Carol Greenwood, Mail Stop TWB01-B10M, Washington, DC 20555-0001<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>NRC Standard Review plan (SRP) 3.6.3 describes Leak-Before-Break (LBB) assessment methodologies that are acceptable to the NRC staff. Specifically, it describes a deterministic assessment procedure that can be used to demonstrate compliance with the 1OCFR50 Appendix A, General Design Requirement (GDC) 4 requirement that the primary system pressure piping exhibit an extremely low probability of rupture (xLPR). SRP 3.6.3 does not allow for assessment of piping systems with active degradation mechanisms. However, it is known that Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) is occurring in systems that have been granted LBB exemptions to remove pipe-whip restraints and jet impingement shields.<br /><br />Recent activities have been undertaken to demonstrate that public safety is maintained despite a deviation from the SRP 3.6.3 prohibition against active degradation mechanisms. These activities include the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Qualitative arguments have been made that the great majority of observed cracking is of limited extent and shallow depth. These factors tend to mitigate the risk of piping rupture.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; PWSCC mitigation activities have been implemented (e.g. reduction of mechanical stresses via the application of weld overlays or inlays over the PWSCC-susceptible welds), and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Re-definition, and reduction, of the design-basis break size from the so-called double-ended guillotine break (DEGB) in recognition of its extremely low likelihood.<br /><br />Given recent advances in probabilistic methodologies,&nbsp;performing a probabilistic analysis of primary system piping that fully addresses and quantifies uncertainties and directly demonstrates compliance with GDC 4&nbsp;may be&nbsp;more appropriate. A robust probabilistic software tool&nbsp;will facilitate meeting this goal, and result in improvement in licensing, regulatory decision-making and design. The tool would be comprehensive with respect to known challenges, vetted with respect to scientific adequacy of models and inputs, flexible enough to permit analysis of a variety of in-service situations and adaptable to accommodate evolving and improving knowledge.<br /><br />As a test of the program feasibility, a pilot study was first conducted. The xLPR pilot study was focused on the PWSCC issue in pressurizer surge nozzles in PWRs. Dual versions of the pilot study xLPR code (Version 1.0) were generated to investigate the appropriate probabilistic framework to be used in this effort. The same basic deterministic modules were used in each code, but the probabilistic framework was developed using the commercial software (GoldSim) and open source software (SIAM). In addition, an initial software quality assurance and configuration management structure was developed and implemented in the pilot study.
<p>The results from the pilot study included:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The project team demonstrated that it is feasible to develop a modular-based probabilistic fracture mechanics code within a cooperative agreement while properly accounting for the problem uncertainties<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The project team demonstrated that the cooperative management structure was promising, but recommends a code development leader be selected and the PIB be restructured as an advisory committee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Based on the framework code comparison, a cost analysis, and long term prospects, the xLPR project team recommended that the future versions of xLPR be developed using GoldSim commercial software as the computational framework</p>
<p>Based on these results from the pilot study, this project is aimed at the development of Version 2.0 of the xLPR code using the GoldSim framework.</p>
<p><strong>Capabilities Sought<br /></strong>The NRC is seeking to identify sources capable of&nbsp;producing the computational framework for the xLPR Version 2.0 code using the GoldSim software. Specific capabilities requirements are listed below.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Expertise in the development of uncertainty characterization methodologies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Expertise in the development of advanced uncertainty propagation methodologies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Expertise in the development and use of large scale optimization and uncertainty estimation software<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Expertise in discrete mathematics applications including scientific computing, parallel algorithms, logistics and scheduling.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Expertise in advanced numerical algorithms: Krylov Subspace methods, preconditioning methods, finite element discretization, time integration methods, and iterative solvers.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Access to supercomputing facilities and advanced software architectures<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Expertise in probabilistic computer code development within a multi-organizational structure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Experience in leading the multi-organizational development of modular software.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Expertise in code development within a robust quality assurance environment including <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. model verification and validation efforts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. advancement of modeling capability to incorporate new science and technology into the system model,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. maintaining software and data to support the overall model, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. use of Subversion for configuration management.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Expertise in the development of complex GoldSim models using advanced coding and stochastic techniques.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. Expertise in the flow and development of the xLPR Version 1 and 2 models.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. Experience and knowledge of primary system piping fracture issues,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 13. Experience and knowledge of NRC regulations as it pertains to extremely low probability of rupture.</p>

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 12:00PM on December 27, 2011.<br><br>Summary of Scope of Work:<br>Background: Fish screens were installed at hydroelectric projects to divert migrating salmon from operating turbines and into bypass facilities.  To increase the fish guidance efficiencies of the screens, intake gates have been raised from their normal stored operating position and dogged near deck levels.  This has required the gates to be disengaged from hydraulic operating systems and in most cases required hydraulic cylinders to be removed, which prevents rapid closure of turbine intake emergency headgates.<br><br>Description of work:<br>1)  Concrete work:  Saw cut and removal of portions of steel reinforced concrete ledger beams in three intake bays of a single turbine unit.  Turbine unit to be dewatered by the Government.  Ledger beams to be overcut, epoxy anchors installed, reinforcing steel installed, concrete formwork installed and concrete poured to final finish dimensions.  Access to the ledger beams is limited.  Access will be from the intake deck at the top of the dam.  The top of the ledger beams are about 85 feet below the intake deck level and 54 feet above the floor of the intake.  The ledger beams are approximately 8 feet high by 20 feet wide by 7.5 feet thick.  About 2.75 feet will be removed from the vertical face.  The work will likely require a mobile crane with man baskets for access of personnel and equipment.  Concrete removed must be captured and lifted to the intake deck for appropriate disposal by the contractor.<br><br>2) Metal Work:  Three Vertical Barrier Fish screens (VBS) are installed and sit on the ledger beams, from top of beams to the intake deck (about 65 feet in length and 20 feet in width).  These screens are composed of a steel framework, nylon mesh, stainless steel wedge wire and panels of solid and perforated steel plate.  The three Vertical Barrier Fish screens will be removed from the intakes by the contractor and refurbished with a new configuration of perforated steel plate and solid panels.  The Corps will reinstall the VBS's following modification to verify proper fit.<br><br>General:  A 2.75 foot portion of the ledger beam between the bulkhead slot and the intake gate slot must be removed to allow the intake gate to be kept in their original open position.<br><br>To accomplish this, tasks for an upcoming contract will include:<br>1)  Remove flow deflector plates.<br>2)  Core drill concrete to install anchors for handling sections of concrete removed.<br>3)  Rig the wire saw and cut out sections of ledger beam for removal (3 bays) while supporting each piece with a crane.<br>4)  Dispose of concrete and flow deflectors.<br>5)  Core drill concrete on the new downstream face of the ledger beam.<br>6)  Install dowels for anchoring the new concrete facing.<br>7)  Install forms and place new concrete face (3 bays).<br>8)  Removal, metal fabrication and installation of the VBS porosity plates (total quantity of 3)<br><br>The contract activities will require the Corps to operate McNary Crane 5 to install the emergency bulkhead in the bay where the ledger beam is being modified, lift/lower the emergency intake gates, and remove/reinstall VBSs.  The contractor must provide a crane and operator for use during the contract period to remove concrete pieces.  Anticipated contract period will be September through December 2012.<br><br>Safety will be a concern with crane lifts of heavy items; potentially icy conditions; and work over water and near forebay intake gates.  Therefore, the contractor will be required to provide a Quality Control Manager and Site Safety and Health Officer.  The personnel assigned to those positions must meet the following requirements.  The Quality Control Manager must have a minimum of 5 years experience on similar projects requiring over-water work and must have completed the "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" course within the last 5 years.  The Site Safety and Health Officer must have: a minimum of 5 years safety work experience on similar projects; completed of the 30-hour OSHA construction safety class or equivalent within the last 5 years; and completed an average of at least 24 hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5 years. <br><br>Crane operators shall be designated as qualified by a source that qualifies crane operators (i.e., union, a government agency, or and organization that tests and qualifies crane operators). Each operator shall have had at least two (2) years experience on a bridge crane of equivalent capacity and characteristics. The contractor's crane requires certification and on-site demonstration to lift 110% of the maximum load to be lifted.

"Ballistic Protection for Individuals" of the U.S. Army NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13.<br><br>OBJECTIVE:<br><br>The desired outcome of this effort is to develop a light weight ESAPI armor system that is 10% lighter than the currently fielded ESAPI.  The end state prototypes shall conform to the performance requirements of the Purchase Description CO/PD 04-19 in its entirety while realizing a 10% weight reduction.  Technology developed under this effort is subject to export controls under current United States Munitions List (USML).<br><br>DESCRIPTION:  <br><br>Current state of the art of material composite armor systems designed to defeat small arms threats consist of three major inputs, 1) ceramic strike-face, 2) a composite backing, and 3) integration and assembly of the ceramic strike-face and composite backing.  <br><br>The three major inputs of a composite armor system are themselves dependent variables of a multitude of independent variables.  Concepts must identify the independent variables to be investigated, how they will be measure and the analysis of the main and interaction effects of these variables.  All concepts must be focused towards the objective of developing a final system configuration that results in a minimum of the objective weight reduction.<br><br>The proposed technical approach must clearly identify how and why the effort will be successful.  Substantiating data and analysis of the proposed approach must be included.  Concepts without supporting technical information will be weighed negatively.  Concept technology must be scalable to full rate production.  Concepts should be programmed with incremental build/test/analyze iterations with specific technical milestones.  Technical approaches should include a well planned Design of Experiments to analyze the main effects and interaction effects of the independent variables to be investigated.<br><br>All ballistic testing shall be planned to be conducted at an independent commercial ballistic test laboratory and included in the cost of the effort.<br><br>The main effort should last approximately no more than one (1) calendar year from contract award with the intent of delivering a 10% lighter solution.  Subsequent phases as option years to the contract may be included to conduct further investigation of key technical discoveries from the main effort.  The intent of subsequent option year phases are to conduct further exploration and capitalize on the successful material solutions and /or processes found during the main effort.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order  for Maintenance and Services of Dimension Icon AFM on a sole source basis to:  Bruker Corporation, 3400 East Britannia Drive, Suite 150, Tuscon AZ  85706   <br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <br><br>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>2) Nature and description of the supplies or update required to meet the agency's needs: <br>Approval is requested to award a sole source contract for Service/Maintenance for the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) System ICON SYS.  The service will provide maintenance of the AFM System ICON SYS via one annual preventive maintenance check and corrective repair of the instrument when required.

This is a very specialized/complicated piece of equipment and should be serviced by the manufacturer; hence, only Veeco/Bruker technicians are qualified to maintain/repair it.  Additionally, this highly complex piece of equipment may require original manufacturer's parts.  Should repairs or routine maintenance be performed by other than qualified Veeco/Bruker technicians, the extended warranty would be null and void.   Furthermore, there are concerns over coverage following the initial warranty period which is about to expire.<br><br> 4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: Extensive market research was conducted at the time of the purchase of the equipment (October 2010).  The AFM was purchased from a distributor via a competitive solicitation.  The Veeco system was the only one that met the Government's needs.<br><br>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: <br>The quote submitted by Bruker Corporation appears to be fair and reasonable based upon comparison with maintenance contracts for similar laboratory equipment. <br><br><br>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: Continuous monitoring of the industrial base will be performed to take advantage of the competitive forces in the marketplace.<br><br>7)  Technical/Requirements Certification<br>I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on  December 20, 2011. <br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Greg Wilson, Contract Specialist<br>Greg.N.Wilson@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order to IHS Global, Inc. (also doing business as SRI Consulting) for the 2012 edition of two chemical market encyclopedias, the Chemical Economics Handbook and the Specialty Chemicals Update Program.  These two encyclopedias provide a unique compilation of information on the chemical industry and on chemical applications necessary to support EPA?s Economic and Policy Analysis Branch analyses.  SRI Consulting is the only source that provides this type of chemical market encyclopedia.  Single volume synopses of the chemical industry lack the breadth, depth of information and insight that these two encyclopedias contain.
The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b)(1).  Efforts to acquire similar supplies, and/or develop alternate sources for this requirement would result in significant additional costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all proposals received within five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive proc urement.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure on a sole source basis a Last-Time Buy (LTB) service with Lockheed Martin Corporation as part of the CASS PBL Contract to repair sufficient Digital Test Unit (DTU) assets to ensure there is enough stock on hand to meet a 2019 CASS Block 1 Station sundown date. It has been estimated that LTB service of repair for 229 additional Teradyne DTU subsystem assets are required to fully support CASS Block 1 Station until 2019. The LTB repair will be added to CASS PBL Contract N68335-09-D-0006 and will enable support of the CASS Block 1 Stations that are installed onboard CVNs, LHAs, Fleet Readiness sites, Navy Depots and Laboratories both Government and Contractor.
<p>The CASS PBL program will have sufficient availability of serviceable CASS Block 1 Station DTU parts to meet obligations through FY2016. In order to meet future Navy requirements for serviceable CASS Block Station 1 DTU parts until at least 2019, an is needed to repair sufficient assets to have enough stock on hand to meet a 2019 sundown date. Teradyne, a subcontractor for the CASS PBL contract, has informed Lockheed Martin that they are closing the repair line for this DTU unit and a LTB would be required.</p>
<p>There is no cost effective, suitable replacement for the CASS Block 1 Station DTU Subsystem. The additional three-year fielding extension of the CASS Block 1 Station was not anticipated, therefore requiring the LTB repair service under the CASS PBL Contract. Only Lockheed Martin, the CASS PBL Prime, and their subcontractor, Teradyne, have the capability and sufficient data rights to perform the repair as well as testing required prior to the DTUs being placed in DTU stock and made available to the fleet.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 3204 (b) (1), FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>On November 24, 2009, President Obama signed Executive Order 13521 directing the establishment of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. The work of the Commission is not only open to the public but is often dependent on feedback from the public. The website is a critical tool in both disseminating meeting transcripts and background materials and in collecting feedback from the public.
<p>Outside web services are required to coordinate with Hillary Wicai Viers, Communications Director for PCSBI, to maintain the website and keep it up to date.</p>
<p>The recent redesign of the overall site now includes back-end access so that our staff can more easily modify content. The Commission is assuming more website management functions, but requires technical assistance from a contractor familiar with the web content management system Drupal to help maintain the newly-designed website.</p>
<p>The website is updated often and is vital to ensuring that the public has unbroken access to archived and future webcasts of the Commission's public meetings, the Commission's reports and investigations, as well as news, updates, and other timely information posted on a regular basis. Information regarding meetings and reports cannot be denied to the public.</p>
<p>WEB ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>In consultation with the Executive Director and/or the Director of Communications for the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI), the Contractor shall develop, maintain and update the pages of the Commission's website. Duties to be performed under task order procedures include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p><br />Task 1 Configure applications on the website to accommodate blogs, webcasts, etc.</p>
<p>Task 2 Serve as system administrator for the website.</p>
<p>Task 3 Evaluate products and services for the website.</p>
<p>Task 4 Provide technical assistance and troubleshoot as needed using the web content management system Drupal.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: N/A<br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 1:30 PM EST on Wednesday December 21st, 2011 1:30 PM EST; Deadline for questions will be Tuesday December 20th, 2011 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx . Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and ttp://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM , respectively.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Amendment # 1<br />RFQ 12--412783
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received about the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION AND ANSWER</p>
<p><br />Q1) Can you please explain this statement. Is this contract for maintenance services? If not, I how can you cull the competition to a 50 mile radius? I could sell the ATV and you can still get service somewhere else.<br /><br />"All interested vendors must also have the ability to provide routine maintenance and repairs at a location within a 50 mile radius of customer. Clarksburg, VA 26306"</p>
<p><em>A1) This contract is not for maintenance services but is for the purchase of ATV's. This statement is just clarifying that all vendors must have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the ability</span> to provide routine maintenance and repairs locally. Thus, most companies have a maintenance agreement with local dealers to provide the routine maintenance on equipment sold.</em></p>
<p>Q2) I won't be able to view the vehicles for trade on this solicitation. Is there a condition report or any photos on these units?</p>
<p>A2) We do not have photos or condition report of the units - this RFQ states that interested vendors are required to provide trade-in value and suggests/prefers interested vendors assess the value of the trade-in by personally inspecting them. This is not required and a contact person is given.</p>
<p><br />Vendor shall acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and is solicited as a Total Small Business Set-aside. The NAICS Code is 336399 - All Other Motor Vehicle Parts Manufacturing, with a business size standard of 750 employees. Companies with other NAICS Codes are encouraged / invited to bid as long as they are a small business in their primary business.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Award will be made to the offeror who provides the Best Value to the government based on past performance and price. Past performance is significantly more important than price, therefore the government may award this contract to other than the lowest priced proposal. Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the contractor whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government. In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.304 and 15.305 and the clause at 52.212-2, the Government will consider the following for award: 1) Price 2) Technical Capability (Past Performance and References). Technical Capability is significantly more important than price. The offeror must demonstrate in the proposal the capability to meet all contract requirements. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a price standpoint. Do not assume that you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss, or revise your proposal. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their proposal. Request for such information does not constitute discussions.

<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)
<p>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing a hemispherical electron analyzer system for analysis of thin films made by pulsed laser ablation. It is well known that thin films made from pulsed laser deposition (PLD) have been shown to retain the same chemical composition in the film as the target. In order to check the composition of these films surface analysis techniques such as X-ray Photoelectron, Auger Electron, and Ultra-Violet Photoelectron Spectroscopies are necessary. Each technique yields important information concerning the chemistry of the sample. All these techniques measure the kinetic energy of electrons under various conditions through the use of electron analyzer. Contractors responding should specify that their equipment meets the specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance. Additionally, sales history, including recent commercial companies sold to should be included to determine commerciality.</p>
<p>The required specifications for one (1) electron analyzer should satisfy the following requirements:<br />(1) Resolution below 1eV.<br />(2) Hemispherical Geometry<br />(3) Dynamic spectra acquisition capabilities w/ minimal loss in resolution<br />a. Range &ge; 20 MHz<br />b. Time &le; 1 Nanosecond<br />(4) Multichannel Detection w/High Count Rate<br />(5) High Temperature Dynamic Acquisition (&gt;1000C)<br />(6) Chemical State Imaging<br />(7) X-ray Source for generation of photo and Auger electrons<br />(8) Programmable Controller Package for customizable experimental procedures</p>
<p>All interested contractors shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to produce the requested equipment to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>Contractors responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman owned business. The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and with its affiliates; and the number of employees does not exceed 500. NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 334516. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled contractor and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.</p>

This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested contractors shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of commercial sales-and product specifications related to this effort.

In accordance with new policies, if a solicitation is advertised for fewer than 30 days and only one offer is received, then the contracting officer shall cancel and resolicit for an additional period of at least 30 days.  The Government is seeking alternative approaches to promote and ensure competition at the delivery order level (see paragraph 5.3(g) and language from Performance Requirements Summary of the DRAFT ITES-3H PWS provided below).  <br><br>Proposed approaches in response to this announcement may include but are not limited to: requirements, mechanisms, or actions on the part of industry and/or the Government at the contract level to facilitate competition at the delivery order level.  As the Government intends to include a metric and/or requirements in the ITES-3H action for bid responses, the Government is interested in obtaining proposed reasons from industry to permit exceptions to not providing a quote.<br><br>Therefore, as noted above, the Government is seeking information concerning the following items:<br><br>1.	What mechanisms, approaches, requirements, etc. should the Government consider to<br>promote further competition at the delivery order level under the proposed ITES-3H to<br>ensure sufficient offers are received on each RFQ?  (Please provide sufficient detail to allow the Government to understand and evaluate the feasibility of your concept)<br><br>2.	In the event that a bid response metric/requirement is included in the planned ITES-3H contracts, what conditions and/or exceptions should be included?<br><br>3.	What are legitimate rationales to providing a no bid?<br><br>4.	What is a beneficial, accurate, and cost effective method to collect and track offer metrics?<br><br>5.	How can RFQ's/responses be tracked and tabulated when not placed on the IT e-mart? (For example: thru e-mail, FedBid, or solicitation posted to FedBizOpps) <br><br>   5.3 (g) Responses to Request for Quote (RFQ) and Proposals Report:   This report is a means to capture the number of proposal submissions your company submitted in response to a Request for Quote or Proposal. In addition, the number of RFQs or proposals that your company did not provide a bid response to this quarter will be captured.   The report is due quarterly.  Submit the 15th of January, April, July and October for the previous quarter.  Submit to CHESS at PEOEIS.PDCHESS.VndrRpts@us.army.mil.  See Attachment A.<br>Language from Performance Requirements Summary: Acceptable Quality Level - Respond to 35% or greater of all delivery orders solicited competitively.  Responses must be within contract scope and within the stated requirements set forth in the orders. "No bid" responses must have rationale for not bidding.<br>INFORMATION:  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  This notice does not obligate the Government to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) or any subsequent action as it relates to the planned ITES-3H. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this announcement or Government use of any information provided.

Responses should be provided in a MS Office Word 2007 compatible document and include the company name and address, POC name, telephone number, and email address.  Any restrictions should be clearly marked.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.
Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request  for Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Central Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  to this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $18.5 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C. Taylor II, Contract Specialist, at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov.no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.  
The FAA plans to publish responses to questions on January 18, 2012, and host a teleconference with interested parties on January 19, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Due to the limited availability of dial in access lines, interested parties are requested to limit representation to one dial in access per company. 
Teleconference details are as follows:Dial In: 202-493-4180  Passcode: 8176
Please be advised, Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, and J.3, Facility Post Exhibits, are being distributed in a generic format.  Due to the sensitivity of the site specific information associated with Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, Sensitive Unclassified Information (SUI) will be released to the awardee.

<DESC><p>Please see the attached Draft SOW for Medicare and Medicaid Adjudication Services.&nbsp; The government is looking for&nbsp;questions and comments&nbsp;from industry to better refine and understand industry's capability to meet the government's requirement.&nbsp; When preparing your response, please comment on one of the two attached copies (Adobe is preferred).&nbsp; As part of your submission, please include a copy of the SOW with comments, and a separate submission with questions.<br /><br />Additionally, the government is trying to gain perspective on:<br /><br />1. Awarding an IDIQ vs. awarding a Requirements type contract.&nbsp; Industry is encouraged to give input on these types.<br /><br />2. The government would like to get a rough order of magnitude of what it might cost to keep an automated adjudication system of medicare claims up to date, as well as to figure out how long it will take to get that system up and running at the start of the contract.<br /><br />Please submit all questions/comments in writing.&nbsp; Questions by phone will not be answered.</p>

<a href="mailto:matthew.g.hudson@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is to advise industry that SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic intends toissue Request for Proposal N65236-11-R-0036 for the purchase of iDirect HubRouter Systems, hub cards, satellite modems, satellite routers, extendedwarranties, and training for this equipment and ancillary items used to enhancesystem performance. The primary users of the equipment are the DoD andFederal Civilian Agencies throughout the Government.The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 334290 with a size standard of 750employees.  The Government estimate for this effort is approximately $85million. A firm-fixed-price, performance based, indefinite delivery, indefinitequantity, commercial item contract is anticipated. The ordering period willinclude a base year with four one-year options. Multiple awards may be madeto authorized distributors/resellers of the iDirect brand name equipment andancillary items.  As requirements are identified, delivery order awards will becompeted among the distributor/reseller contract holders. Questions pertainingto this notice may be directed, in writing, to Matthew G. Hudson, ContractSpecialist, at matthew.g.hudson@navy.mil.The subject procurement will be solicited on a sole-source basis with brandname restrictions as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(c) and justified in accordancewith FAR 6.303 and 6.304.  The resulting justification and approval documentwill be posted with the RFP in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).Several unique qualities of the iDirect system necessitate brand namerestrictions.The iDirect systems use the Deterministic-Time Division Multiple Access (D-TDMA) scheme upstream.  The Hub router constantly analyzes the networkdemand and allocates bandwidth to each remote location based on trafficdemand at each remote location, and network operator imposed Quality ofService (QoS) profiles. The deterministic nature of the bandwidth allocationalgorithm allows for a very rapid distribution of burst time plans to theremotesin a network  8 times per second by default.  This type of deterministicarchitecture allows the system to take advantage of the statistical nature ofdynamic TCP/IP traffic demands, creating efficient transport of data traffic.For downstream, the iDirect systems uses Digital Video Broadcasting- SatelliteSecond Generation/Adaptive Code Modulation (DVB-S2/ACM) which provides amuch higher IP data rate (149 Mbps maximum).The D-TDMA protocol's rapid allocation of bandwidth provides for superiorperformance of real-time applications and the ability to deploy applicationspecific QoS.  Application specific QoS provides prioritization and bandwidthguarantees to different types of traffic per remote. For example, one canprioritize VoIP traffic over HTTP traffic or prioritize video traffic over filetransfers. Bandwidth allocation and prioritization can be triggered bySource/Destination IP, Source/Destination subnet, Source/Destination Port,DiffeServ/TOS bits, VLAN ID and/or by protocol type.  The Hub router polls theremote terminals 8 times per second to determine transmission requirementsand dynamically assigns transmission time slots based on transmissionrequirements.The Hub router is capable of handling multiple (20 or more) two-waycommunications channels from up to five different satellites simultaneously.The Hub Router System has been optimized to handle Transmission ControlProtocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic over satellite links and is neededforthe burst communications traffic patterns normally found in hub-spokecommunications networks.  The Hub router also has automatic in-route powercontrol that ensures that the Quality of Service (QoS) over the satellite linksremains constant even through severe weather conditions.  This technologyprovides more efficient use of satellite bandwidth by allowing multiple unitstouse a single channel.  The data packets are also much longer (1500 bytes)than that used by other protocols which allows a much higher throughput andgreater bandwidth efficiency (98%).  This allows the Government to providebetter SATCOM services within its bandwidth resources.In addition, the specified satellite communications components must alsointerface and be configurable with existing iDirect hub systems.  No systemsother than those manufactured by iDirect are fully compatible and configurablewith the Hub Routers and iDirect modems.  The current solicitation is intendedto support at least four separate existing satellite networks currently usingiDirect technology (three DoD networks and one non-DoD network).  In additionto the twelve hub systems involved, there are well over 2,000 remote terminalsconnected to these networks with embedded iDirect modems.  All of thesesystems are TRANSEC and FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified.  To replace thesesystems with another modem would require replacement of all of the Hubsystems, replacement of the modems in existing terminals, and all systemswould then have to be recertified and receive Approval to Operate (ATO) on theGlobal Information Grid (GIG).  Further, all previously developed trainingcourses for field operation/maintenance would have to be modified,configuration control established for the new systems, previously developeddocumentation would have to be modified, and new spares ordered.  The latestversions of the iDirect modems meet all TRANSEC and FIPS 140-2requirements and use DVB-S2/ACM and TDMA modes.  While some older linecards have been replaced, the basic iDirect hubs are still functional and canbeupgraded as required, instead of replaced, to meet DoD communicationsrequirements.  The cost to replace these items plus the "downtime" required tocarry out this transformation would be significant.The Government is soliciting this requirement with brand name descriptions dueto the unique capabilities of the iDirect products and to ensure compatibilitywith the existing systems.This is not a solicitation announcement. The projected timeframe for issuanceof the Request for Proposal is 2Q FY 2012. This synopsis is for informationaland planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid orproposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds theGovernment to solicit for or award a competitive contract. Unless otherwisestated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formalRequest for Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement iscurrently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. If asolicitationis released it will be found on the FEDBIZOPS and the SPAWAR E- COMMERCEwebpage: https://e-commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil. It is the potential offeror'sresponsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation.It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic'secommerce website for the release of the RFP and amendments (if any). Firmsare encouraged to review the web site regularly for updated information.

<p>6. All questions regarding this notice or the TABSS procurement shall be directed to the Contracting Officer at TABSS@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />UPDATE 19 (25 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide Amendment 7 and an amended RFP. For additional information, please see below:</p>
<p>(1) The only area amended in the RFP is the hand delivery instructions in Section L-4. Due to the expected high volume of proposals, offerors hand delivering their proposals need to use the loading dock on the T Street Southwest (SW) side of the Jemal Building. Upon arrival at the loading dock area, offerors should go through the brown gate and climb the stairs to enter the building at the loading dock&nbsp;guard desk. Please see the attached map for further information; note that this map is not a part of Amendment 7.</p>
<p>Please also note that the delivery building and address (1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20593) are the same as before; only the proposal reception area is being changed.</p>
<p>(2) To reiterate, all proposals are due by 3 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, March 2nd, 2011.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver proposals before Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to coordinate their proposal deliveries with Nathan Dolezal or with Katherine Powers to ensure proper proposal reception. This coordination can be done via email to Nate.Dolezal@uscg.mil&nbsp;or Katherine.Powers@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver their proposals on Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to plan accordingly due to the aforementioned proposal volume and limited parking at the Jemal Building.</p>
<p>(3) After the government receives the offeror's package, the government will provide a receipt of confirmation. This receipt is provisional pending the package successfully passing the government screening process.</p>
<p>Any offeror who has not received a confirmation receipt or is not in line at the loading dock of the Jemal Building by 3 PM EST will have their proposal considered late.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br />UPDATE 18 (17 February 2011)<br /><br />The purpose this update is to provide Amendment 6 and three amended RFP attachments.&nbsp; These documents are located&nbsp;in the lower-right hand side of this page.<br /><br />As described in Amendment 6, the three attachments have been amended as follows: <br /><br />1.) Attachment 3B - A formula error has been fixed.<br /><br />The version of Attachment 3B attached to this amendment shall be used by offerors submitting Domain 2 proposals.<br /><br />2.) Attachment 4 - Typographical errors have been fixed.<br /><br />3.) Attachment 10 - References have been corrected.<br /><br />The RFP and all other RFP attachments are unchanged.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE 17 (11 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the TABSS Q+A Addendum Matrix. It is located in the lower-right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>The Q+A Addendum Matrix has two parts. The first part consists of questions that were received before the TABSS question due date but were accidentally left off of the original TABSS Q+A Matrix. The second part consists of clarifications regarding certain questions from the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.</p>
<p>The government will accept no further questions. Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix will be updated in the future. In the event of a discrepancy between either matrix and the amended RFP, the amended RFP governs.</p>
<p>Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix are included in any of the TABSS amendments. They are provided as guidance to offerors.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.</p>
<p>UPDATE 16 (10 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the amended RFP and RFP attachments. Of particular note is the amended Attachment 10, "Labor Category Descriptions and Qualifications Matrix," along with the new Attachment 11, "Annual Small Business Subcontracting Compliance Report."</p>
<p>Two copies of the RFP are being provided, an "informational" copy with highlighting and a "conformed" copy without highlighting. In the informational copy, all new changes to the RFP have been highlighted in turquoise. Changes made via Amendment 4 are highlighted in yellow. The content of the two RFPs (both informational and conformed) is identical. Please use the conformed copy in the future.</p>
<p>Attachments that have been changed since Amendment 4 are updated per the descriptions on the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5. Any attachment not mentioned in the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5 is unchanged. However, all attachments are included with this update for offerors' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the amended RFP, to reiterate:</p>
<p>(1) Paper copies of proposals are required. Please see Sections L-5 and L-6 of the amended RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(2) Labor category descriptions are provided in the amended Attachment 10. Offerors should meet those stated requirements</p>
<p>(3) For offerors' acknowledgement of amendments, please see Section L-8 of the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluation Factor 3, "Socio-economic Considerations," has been significantly amended. Please see Sections L and M of the RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(5) For the $250 contractual minimum, this amount will be obligated to each contract at the time of award. It will not be provided as consideration for the contractor's requirement to attend the post-award conference. Travel expenses for post-award conferences are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>(6) The proposal due date is extended until 3 PM Eastern Standard Time on 03/02/2011.</p>

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>
