<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to continue development of an Aviation Safety Risk Management (ASRM) model.	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially funded Rutgers University (Rutgers) to build Aviation System Risk Model (ASRM) accident scenario models, which includes a probabilistic, analytical approach that builds upon the use of Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), the Reason Model (James Reason), and Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) Taxonomy, delivers relative risk reduction metric as an output.  NASA LaRC subsequently awarded a three-year contract to Rutgers to further develop the ASRM.  Development of ARSM required significant input from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) residing throughout the FAA, Airlines, and NASA. The ASRM models which Rutgers has since developed under NASA contract NAS1-03057 require updating to include the current portfolio of technologies as well as augment with additional models addressing the needs of the ASRM Program and the public.  Contract NAS1-03057 expires in December 2005.	 NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the service from Rutgers.  The level of sophistication in the version of ASRM is the result of many years of research and development accomplished by Rutgers and funded by NASA and the FAA.  If any source other than Rutgers is used, it would have to develop a prototype similar to the ASRM or understand the logic and programming code in the Rutgers-developed ASRM prototype.  To complete either of these tasks, the alternate source must possess the technical ability to develop BBNs models specifically relevant to aviation safety, have extensive knowledge about all the existing Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) products, as well as, develop the understanding of the new AvSP products.	Given the complexity of this program, the government estimates that it would take at least one year for another source to acquire such knowledge before it can effectively continue to further develop the ASRM models.  A one-year delay in completion of this task would eliminate the possibility of obtaining needed technology effectiveness values in time to present results to a Non-Advocate Review (NAR) board.  Completion of the NAR is required to continue progression of the program.  Thus, Rutgers is the only source capable of satisfying the government’s requirement because Rutger’s alone has accumulated the necessary knowledge and experience to successfully continue the development of the ASRM models.  Thus the government intends to execute a bi-lateral modification with Rutgers to extend the existing contract (i.e. NAS1-03057) by an additional two, one-year options to allow continued development of the ASRM models.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 12, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Capabilities/qualifications shall, as a minimum, discuss the following issues: A contact list of relevant Subject Matter Experts; Software platform information; Resumes which include Aviation Safety Risk Modeling and Experience. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), in Newport News, Virginia. TJNAF is a premier, DOE dedicated-program, national research facility located on a 162  acre site. TJNAF conducts key elements of DOE's missions in science, specifically nuclear physics. TJNAF is also designated as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and a premier DOE laboratory that provides extensive capabilities in both world-class research expertise and unique facilities and are generally beyond the capability of any nongovernmental institution to construct or operate. Through these national resources, which are available to researchers from universities, industry, other government agencies and other nations, the Department advances the energy, national security and economic well being of the United States, provides for the international advancement of science, and educates future scientists and engineers.  Anticipated funding for FY 2005 for TJNAF, from all sources, is approximately $100,000,000.  TJNAF is an international leader in experimental and theoretical research of the quark substructure of nuclei, the fundamental building blocks of matter. The laboratoryâ€™s nuclear research increases our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter and the forces that hold it together. The laboratory serves an international user community of approximately 1,100 scientists, primarily from universities. It also is the national leader in the development of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) accelerating technology. TJNAF is dedicated to the development of intense sources of electron and photon beams using the SRF technology.  At the center of the laboratory is the worldâ€™s first large-scale superconducting electron accelerator located in an underground tunnel almost a mile long in circumference.   The SRF core technology benefits not only TJNAF but also advances other research facilities in DOE Nuclear Physics and Basic Energy Sciences and the Department of Defense.

<DESC>NIAID is establishing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit proposals to address the Institute’s need for improving the immune response of immunocompromised individuals to vaccines and immunotherapies that defend against NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  The purpose of the BAA is to solicit proposals for research programs that focus on either:  1) the discovery of basic biological mechanisms that cause these immune deficits (Research Area 1); or 2) testing of treatments that are designed to increase the safety and efficacy of such vaccines and immunotherapies in immunocompromised populations (Research Area 2).  The ultimate goal of this research program is to protect the human population from potential bioterrorism agents.  Therefore, it is expected that research results will provide information that ultimately contributes to the development of new or improved vaccines and/or immunotherapeutic treatments that target the human population, with a focus on immunocompromised individuals.  It is anticipated that five (5) to (10) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded, each with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 30, 2005.  RFP-NIAID-DMID-BAA-05-11 will be available electronically on or about October 5, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Gardi H.P. Dharmaratna, Director General of Meteorology, Department of Meteorology, 383 Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Columbo 7, Sri Lanka, Tel: 94 11 285 6358, Fax: 94 11 269 8311. Sri Lanka Disaster Early Warning System Capacity Development and Systems Integration Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to improve data reporting of potential hazards and to automate analysis and decision-making with current information technology tools for the Department of Meteorology (Met Department) in Sri Lanka.

The Sri Lankan Met Department is the principle government organization tasked with tracking weather and natural hazards.  When the Interim Committee on an Early Warning and Mitigation System was created in March 2005 the Met Department assumed the lead role for disaster identification and public warning.  

Presently Met Department’s data collection, assessment and notification systems and procedures are manual processes. The Met Department does not have the ability to automatically acquire and review real-time data from international and domestic sources that report seismic events, tide levels and other critical information needed to detect natural hazards.  The Technical Assistance seeks to improve the Met Department’s data collection and decision support infrastructure and significantly reduce response time to inform the public in times of national emergency.  

These objectives will be met through an evaluation of Met Department’s existing data collection procedures; automating data collection and event analysis; defining and deploying a pilot disaster management system for the Met Department; improving methodologies for communicating with VIPs and the DMC; and providing training in all appropriate technical areas associated with the proposed solutions.     

The specific strategic outcomes of the project will be to: 
1.	Achieve near real-time collection of critical disaster data;
2.	Analyze data using latest generation digital mapping and decision support tools;
3.	Implement standard operating procedures for crisis management;
4.	Reduce public response time from the moment of identification of a potential tsunami event; and, 
5.	Ensure that Met Department staff are properly trained on new systems and operating center best practices.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $398,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm Local Time, November 1, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A--Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques to Measure the Physical Parameters Involved During the Inflation and Descent Phases of Round Parachutes and Ram-air Inflated Parafoils
<SOLNBR>DAAD15-AADD-INSTRMEAS
<RESPDATE>111405
<ARCHDATE>01132006
<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Center (RDECOM-NSC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) for white papers on instrumentation and measurement techniques to measure the physical paramet  ers involved during the inflation and descent phases of round parachutes and ram-air inflated parafoils. The objectives of the measurements are to monitor the aerodynamics and structural dynamics of parachutes (full-scale and small-scale parachutes) and t  o provide a database for the verification and validation of the mathematical/computer models currently being developed by NSC to predict the performance of parachutes. Highly sensitive, fast responding, light weight, and wireless sensors, and minimally or  non-obtrusive measurement techniques are needed to monitor the transient air flow inside and outside the parachute canopy, the structural dynamics of the canopy fabric and the overall parachute shape and motion.  Specifically, the following are the parame ters to be measured: spatial canopy position, motion and geometry, fabric strain, opening force, air velocity, air pressure, and overall flow field.  Multiple sensors are required to fully monitor the large flow field and fabric of the canopy.  Measurement s of the flow field desired include (but are not limited too) canopy surface fluid pressure, pressure field in the near wake of the parachute, velocity field in the near wake and internal flows of the canopy, and boundary layer profiles on the canopy surfa ce.  Given the significant changes in the shape and the short time in which parachutes inflate, transient measurements of all these parameters are necessary and desired.  Although it is desired to conduct full-scale parachute tests in an open atmosphere or  a free-drop environment, it is necessary to conduct some parachute experiments under more controlled conditions, such as wind/water tunnels using small-scale parachutes.  However, it is essential that instrumentation and measurement techniques be utilized  in a larger scale environment, such as parachutes deployed from an aircraft or parachutes free-dropped inside a large, high ceiling, enclosed building (such as a blimp hangar or sports arena) with the instrumentation moving with the parachute or the parac  hute moving past the instrumentation at a fixed region. Small-scale parachutes will also be tested in the free-drop environment.  Full-size US Army parachute canopy size varies from 962 sq. ft. (35 ft. diameter) for personnel parachutes to 7,850 sq. ft. ( 100 ft. diameter) for cargo parachutes.  Small-scale parachutes being considered for testing range in size from 0.8 sq. ft. to 200 sq. ft. (1-16 ft. diameter).     Canopy fabrics are typically made of nylon having areal densities of 1.1 - 2.2 oz/sq. yd., a nd permeability of 0 - 140 cu. ft./min. at a 1/2-in. water pressure.  The loading density of the canopy fabric is between 0.5 and 1 lb/sq. ft. for full-size canopies (during steady descent) and 0.1 to 0.5 for small-scale canopies.     Opening times of full -scale parachutes are on the order of seconds and those of small-scale parachutes for wind tunnel studies are less than one second.     The asociated peak opening forces are on the order of 5 to 10 Gs.  Vertical descent velocities are 15 - 30 ft/sec; some one-time use parachutes for humanitarian airdrop missions have higher descent velocities at about 70 ft./sec.     Instrumentation is generally more developed for small-scale parachutes in wind/water tunnel studies than for full-scale parachutes.  But a cap ability to monitor the detailed flow field of full-scale parachutes is particularly needed for parachute testing and development. All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a White Paper to NSC in accordance with NSC Broad Agency Ann ouncement 05-07 which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ssbaa.htm.    Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI.  Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested inform ation, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.

The contract time period will include a base year not to exceed (12) months with the possibility of two (2) one-year option periods.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract with an estimated award date of December 4, 2005.  We are soliciting for 23 copy machines on a leasing agreement.  Please provide us with the flat rate of a cost per copy for the maintenance agreement for each machine.  This cost should include any leasing costs we will be required to pay.  Also, the agreement will include all repairs, supplies, such as toner, etc. and what other items are included.  The standard contract is inclusive of everything with the exception of staples and paper.  Please confirm this in your quote.

If there is an allowance of copies per month, please provide us with this figure.  If this figure is reached, please provide the overage cost per copy, even if it is the same amount of the original cost per copy.

If your company does receive the award of the contract, you will receive a listing of each location with a contact name and extention number in order for meter readings to be obtained.

Along with a bid on the actual copier maintenance and cost per copy, we are requesting the copy machines that you provide be a digital type machine with some of the following features included:  stapling, sorting, duplexing, automatic feed on top, reduction/enlarging, auto tray switching, book copy, photo mode, etc.  

As for repair calls, there will be a requirement of a 24 hour turnaround after the repair call has been made.  There is also a requirement of two technicians, at a minimum, to be available to repair the machines; therefore, no down time should be experienced when placing repair calls.  The names of the technicians must be provided at the time of submission of your quote.

We will not be taking advantage of the networking system that so many companies offer.  There are too many hindrances with our agency that restrict us from taking advantage of this feature.  This should not be included in your price.

An invoice must be received from the company who receives the award each month identifying costs for the prior month's services.

Please be advised, on a security note, if your company receives the award of this copier maintenance contract, the technicians you provide to perform the maintenance, or any other representative from your company, will not have any communications or any contact with our inmate population at the Federal Correctional Institution, Federal Satellite Low or the Federal Prison Camp.  If it is reported that communications have been taking place with the inmate population, based on the circumstances and the severity of the breach of security, dismissal will be warranted and the contract will be immediately terminated.  Please be aware of this!

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Gardi H.P. Dharmaratna, Director General of Meteorology, Department of Meteorology, 383 Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo-7, Sri Lanka, Tel: 94 11 269 4104, Fax: 94 11 269 8311. Sri Lanka Disaster Early Warning System Capacity Development and Systems Integration Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to improve data reporting of potential hazards and to automate analysis and decision-making with current information technology tools for the Department of Meteorology in Sri Lanka.

The Sri Lankan Department of Meteorology (Met Department) is the principle government organization tasked with tracking weather and natural hazards.  When the Interim Committee on an Early Warning and Mitigation System was created in March 2005 the Met Department assumed the lead role for disaster identification and public warning.  

Presently Met Department’s data collection, assessment and notification systems and procedures are manual processes. The Met Department does not have the ability to automatically acquire and review real-time data from international and domestic sources that report seismic events, tide levels and other critical information needed to detect natural hazards.  The Technical Assistance seeks to improve the Met Department’s data collection and decision support infrastructure and significantly reduce response time to inform the public in times of national emergency.  

These objectives will be met through an evaluation of Met Department’s existing data collection procedures; automating data collection and event analysis; defining and deploying a pilot disaster management system for the Met Department; improving methodologies for communicating with VIPs and the DMC; and providing training in all appropriate technical areas associated with the proposed solutions.     

The specific strategic outcomes of the project will be to: 
1.	Achieve near real-time collection of critical disaster data;
2.	Analyze data using latest generation digital mapping and decision support tools;
3.	Implement standard operating procedures for crisis management;
4.	Reduce public response time from the moment of identification of a potential tsunami event; and, 
5.	Ensure that Met Department staff are properly trained on new systems and operating center best practices.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $398,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm Local Time, November 1, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Amendment 2 is issued to answer the following questions from vendors:

1. QUESTION: On item 2, they ask for a 220/230 volt output, but then say they want 8 Nema 5-20 R receptacles which are rated for 120 Volt. What is the proper voltage ? 

   ANSWER:  220/230 Volts, so the Nema receptacles need to be rated for 220/230 volts. 


2. QUESTION:  The server rack is usually shipped unassembled. Is this the way you want it delivered? 

   ANSWER:  No, we want it fully assembled. We require them assembled and inside delivery.  


3. QUESTION:  Could you be more specific on the delivery? For instance would delivery by a carrier such as UPS or DHL be acceptable? 

   ANSWER:  Yes, inside delivery to server room.


4. QUESTION:  Your specifications call for notification of the POC a minimum of 48 hours before delivery - there is only one location POC listed - are their others?

   ANSWER:  Notify Alicia Allen and Tory Baggiano. (We'll notify the sites that the gear is shipping)

<CONTACT>Christopher Pigott Contract Specialist 7037871238     Christopher.Pigott@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI), GovWorks, intends to solicit full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.102-(b).  This competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  HHS needs to contract for the requirement described below.  Offerors able to provide the required services are invited to identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements by submitting their qualifications/capabilities and any other information which show a capability to meet this requirement. I. Background. The mission of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is to prevent and eliminate unlawful discrimination in the provision of health care and social services generally and in HHS-funded programs particularly; to ensure the privacy of protected health information, and to enhance access to quality programs funded by the HHS.  Through public education, outreach, complaint investigation and resolution and other compliance activities, OCR helps HHS carry out its overall mission of improving the health and well-being of all people affected by its many programs.  Among other duties, OCR investigates complaints that alleged violations of various civil rights laws by HHS-funded recipients.  Among the laws enforced by OCR is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by the recipients of federal financial assistance.  OCR enforces Section 504 with respect to HHS fund recipients.  OCR also enforces Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by states and local government entities, with respect to health and human services programs.  II. Objective.  This contract will help HHS, through OCR, implement the President's "New Freedom Initiative" and, more specifically, Executive Order 13217 (June 18, 2001), which directs the Secretary of HHS to provide technical guidance to help states achieve the goals of the ADA.  This contract will aid HHS in resolving key aspects of ongoing complaint investigations that alleged violations of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581(1999).  These complaints allege that qualified individuals with disabilities have been denied services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  III. Scope.  OCR requires expert consultant services to evaluate actions undertaken by a state to assess and place on wait lists for community placement, individuals, currently institutionalized in state owned and operated psychiatric facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with mental retardation, and nursing facilities but who could receive community-based services as an appropriate alternative to institutional care.  The contractor will develop standards and criteria for evaluating the state's actions.  The contractor will advise OCR of the effectiveness of the state's wait list management and prioritization policies.  The contractor will also advise OCR as to the need for new or revised state policies, procedures and related documents, once institutionalized individuals are identified for community placement; review these documents, and make recommendations about them. In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, NLT 10/7/05, a capability statement detailing: (1) your key personnel who would have the primary responsbility for performing and/or managing the work with their qualifications and specific experience; and (2) your organizational experiences including your business size.  Your capability statement will be evaluated based on the information you provided.  Following review of all capability statements, a list of those deemed capable and qualified to perform the work will be established and those qualified will be notified and provided proposal instructions and contract requirements via a synopsis in Fed Biz Opps.  No further notice will be posted on Fed Biz Opps.  Requests for a copy of the draft Statement of Work and answers to questions regarding this acquisition shall be made via email to the POC below.  The deadline for submission of questions via email to the POC is 10/3/05.  Answers will only be transmitted to companies who submit requests.  Please ensure the GovWorks solicitation number 44724 is referenced in all correspondence. Point of Contact (POC) for this acquisition is Melicent Nhan at melicent.nhan@mms.gov or fax 703-787-1106.

<DESC>Requirements for Scanning System Description: this is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions-see submittal requirements below.  After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, a RFQ will be issued.  Responses to this sources sought announcement are not adequate response to the solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the RFQ announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought announcement.  The Veterans Affairs, VA medical center, Cleveland, is seeking sources for a potential contract to provide scanning, archival, and retrieval system as stated by the overview and requirements herein. 1.  Overview - 	The Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center is actively pursuing a scanning/archival/retrieval system to store document images on site.   This technical solution must solve these challenges. Below are specific requirements and deliverables.   2.  Requirements -  	The following describes requirements for this project.    A.	Document Scanning – Document scanning is required to scan all fiscal invoices.  The following describes what should be included under this requirement. 1.	Scanning – must support both single page and multi-page documents. 2.	Volume – daily scanning will be invoices 25-40 regular invoices and 150 fee invoices and 20-30 other documents.  Journal vouchers prepared by fiscal along with related documents, documents currently stored on the lektriever from the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year are estimated at approximately 40,000 pages. The system must be capable of scanning and storing batches of documents. 3.	Locations – scanning will be done primarily in two location.  However the system must be able to allow for distributed scanning at any of the CVAMC locations. 4.	The system must be expandable to allow for additional scanners in the future.    B.	Storage/Retrieval – The data is to be stored on a VA secured server.  There is a requirement to store all scanned documents described above with growth for approximately a 7 year period.  Below describes specific requirements for storage and retrieval. 1.	Storage- the system should be designed to allow for network accessible storage.  Documents scanned must be properly indexed for ease of retrieval. The system must be able to use Microsoft SQL as the backend storage database. 2.	Limits – storage capability must exist to store data as described above with retention of 7 years.  Storage must be expandable for future growth. 3.	Backup – a solution should be proposed to allow offline backup/archival of scanned items. 4.	Assuming this would be a server/storage solution it must be a standard rack mountable solution that can be put into the data center of the facility. 5.	Retrieval - Documents must be indexed for easy retrieval.  Scanned documents will be held in a queue to be indexed. Some flexibility of numbering will be needed.  Invoices would have the purchase order number as the first reference.  Query by purchase order should give a listing of all items under that number.  Additional information would be included on each line to distinguish one document from another; such as invoice number and the dollar amount.  Clicking on the line should bring up the document for viewing.  Fee invoices are normally filed by batch number, journal vouchers by a number similar to a purchase order.  As use of the system is expanded to voucher audit, payroll and the chief's office other schematics will be needed.  The indexing and retrieval system must be flexible and modifiable by our staff. C.	Printing – Once a document is retrieved it should be printable to any medical center network capable printer. D.

<DESC>Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Request for Information (RFI) LIGHT-WEIGHT SOLAR ARRAY (LWSA) THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. RFI Purpose The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Program may seek to procure a Light-Weight Solar Array (LWSA) for the LRO spacecraft.  This subsystem would include the solar cells/electrical hardware, support structure/substrate, and any array unfolding devices as necessary. The LWSA vendor would provide all the engineer, design, assembly, and test support required for the development of the LWSA. The LWSA would be integrated to the LRO spacecraft.  In order to meet the extremely aggressive LRO schedule the LWSA must have a high Technical Readiness Level (TRL).  The system must demonstrate design and qualification heritage, with particular interest in a high power to mass ratio.   This RFI is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid. Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  Overview The Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP) is a sequence of missions intended to perform measurements, technology demonstrations and infrastructure deployments to enable a successful human return to the Moon in the 2015-2020 timeframe.  RLEP consists of a sequence of (nominally) annual missions to the lunar vicinity.	Each mission will build upon the discoveries and emplaced infrastructure provided by previous missions.  The RLEP sequence begins in 2008 with the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission will conduct measurements and investigations of the lunar surface and its environment.  Primary objectives include high-resolution topographic mapping of the surface, characterization of the lunar radiation environment and investigation of potential in-situ resource concentrations.  LRO will maintain a 50 km lunar polar orbit for a period of 1 year following commissioning, with the potential for up to 4 years of extended mission in a low-maintenance orbit.	Possible extended mission scenarios include additional measurement collection and proximity relay cross-support for follow-on RLEP and international missions. More information about the LRO mission including science objectives, spacecraft architectures, and spacecraft development schedule can be found on line at http://lunar.gsfc.nasa/missions.gov. Description of Light-Weight Solar Array (LWSA) LRO will utilize a solar array to capture the Sun’s energy, convert it to electrical energy, power the spacecraft, and charge the spacecraft batteries. Due to the size/mass of the LRO Spacecraft and Launch Vehicle fairing envelop constraints, the mass and stowage requirements cannot be met with a conventional rigid array.  Therefore, GSFC requires a Deployable LWSA.  The LWSA must be folded against the spacecraft for launch to fit within the launch-vehicle fairing, and be properly supported during launch.  The LWSA must include a constraint system and release from the side of the spacecraft.  The Solar Array will be opened soon after separation from the launch vehicle.   The Solar Array may require a deployment boom and articulation system to meet the Solar Array pointing requirements.  However,	the boom and articulation system are not part of this RFI. LWSA Criteria 1)	TRL: 5 or higher (new developments will not be considered)  2)	Minimum risk to schedule (Qual. heritage): Delivery by November 2007 3)	Specific Power: Mass: 19 kg, Power: 1850W EOL (see perf. spec) 4)	Cost 5)	Stowed Volume (see performance spec) 6)	Robustness in the applicable environment (see perf. spec) 7)	Ease of ground testing and handling LRO Spacecraft Requirements / Information The LRO LWSA design and performance requirements are given in the attached “LRO LWSA Performance Specifications and Information Document”.  Included are the Power requirements, general Mechanical/Thermal design requirements, and interface constraints and considerations.  Response Content The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is interested in soliciting a system level design of a LWSA including interface definitions, development schedule, cost estimates, and any risk evaluations. The objectives of this RFI are to improve NASA’s knowledge of industry's capabilities, and to improve the overall understanding of what LWSA options exist for LRO. To consolidate our planning, we request responses from industry within 15 calendar days of the release date of this RFI. The response shall be in the form of written and illustrated concepts, estimates for subsystem cost and schedule, assumptions used for cost and schedule estimates including interface and design assumptions, and description of capability.	Also included in the response should be performance characteristics of the LWSA, including mass, total cell area, array shape, and power output capability (BOL & EOL).  Responses can be submitted via email. The subject line of the submission should be "Response to LRO Light-Weight Solar Array RFI” and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes." It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. Technical questions should be directed to:  John Lyons/Lead Solar Array Engineer, LRO/RLEP, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771,  Code 563, at (301) 286-3841 or John.W.Lyons@nasa.gov.   Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal, solicitation number is H92244-05-Q-0088, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.

The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NAVSPECWARDEVGRU)  has a potential requirement to procure the following:

CLIN 0001 Repair, Refurbishment and Replacement of Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG) Obstacle Course in accordance with the following performance based statement of work:

Description of Current Course.  There are no records of date of construction but the course is at least fifteen (15) years old with adhoc repairs made over the years.  The telephone poles are in good shape and may or may not be practical for reuse on new events.  Most of the other materials will need to be replaced.

Limits of Construction.  No trees will be cut down but tree limbs may be trimmed as needed.  The open area between the canals, the tree line in the rear (near fenced area), and the area around the entrance are the border limits of this course; no construction is authorized outside of this area.  A NSWDG representative will walk the perimeter area with vendor prior to start of construction to avoid misunderstanding.  During construction, the workmen will limit their activities to the immediate area when not in transition from the entry control point to the obstacle course.

Required Standards.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Regulation 350-6 and Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT), or err on the side of safety.

The general requirements of all events and trail ways are as follows:  All materials used in this project will be of the highest quality and able to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  Soft material (ropes, nets, etc.) must be usable and safe for a minimum of three years (at which time these components will be replaced).  All wood products will be treated for outdoor use and made to last for a minimum of twelve years.  All treated materials will meet minimum safety standards for human use.  All metal products (nails, screws, bolts, hangers, etc) will either be galvanized or stainless-steel.  All events will be built in accordance with construction standards were the loads (platforms, crossbeams, etc) is transfer to the ground and not on bolts or screws – the loads will rest on notches on log or on top of posts.  The typical weight to be expected on any one event is 750 pounds (three people) and each event is required to have a minimum of 5:1 load rating (3,750 lbs or better) for safety.  The primary pathway (event to event) will be lined in a wood border and filed with a minimum of four inches of wood mulch.  The area around the events where a fall may happen will be filled with rubber mulch, and all areas that a fall are likely to happen will have a fall arrest device (net, crash pad, etc).   Because each event is different, some minor exceptions are authorized as long as they meet required standards.

Event #1 (Parallel Bars).  New event at the start of the course – similar to the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  A set of approximately 16 foot parallel bars ascends to three tiers.  The bars start at three feet high and should width apart then ascent to the first and highest tier.  The highest tier will be eight feet tall with each subsequent tier one foot lower – each tier is four feet long.  Support post of wood with wood mulch underneath the event.  

Event #2 (Five Pole Vault/Dirty Name).  Currently, there are five vaults in place.  Remove the last two vaults to make room for the dirty name event.  Dirty name built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6.  Past the dirty name two vaults will be added to the end mimicking the first two existing vaults.  Wood mulch added under vaults and rubber mulch under dirty name.

Event #3 (Rope Climb/Descending Platforms/Balance Beam).  Using existing logs, replace the platform and cross beam.  Replace current rope with 1.5 hemp climbing rope and have rubber mulch underneath.  Balance beam to be bolted to new cross support beams at each end and one in the middle.

Event #4 (Vertical Walls).  Using the existing logs, replace all boards and cap each event.  Fill in ruts on back side and cover with wood mulch on both sides

Event #5 (Rope Climb and Descent).  Using existing logs, replace face with tongue and groove planks on both sides with a cap on top.  Existing metal cross beam replaced with pole spar arm and replace existing rope with 1.5 inch hemp rope.    The area around the wall with has rubber mulch added for fall protection.

Event #6 (Skyscraper/Slide for Life).  This is one of two major events where safety is of primary concern; safety will not be compromised).  Complete replacement of existing event with one built IAW TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (pages 91 and 92).  This 40 foot tall hybrid event will combine two obstacles (skyscraper and slide for life) from Reg. 350-6.  This event will have a safety net about ¾ of the length of the slide rope (following down the ropes angle) ending where the height of the rope is less than eight feet.  This event will have rubber mulch under the entire slide and crash pads at the base of the tower.  Due to the scope of this event, a NSWDG representative will be available to answer questions and provide details during construction.

Event #7 (The tough one).  New event built in open space (path) adjacent to Event #6 to be built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 89).  Rubber mulch will be spread under and around the event while crash pads will be located in the primary fall zone.

Event #8 (Monkey Bar/Tarzan).  Using existing poles, the approach side of the event will have a balance beam added similar to “The Tarzan” in TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 92).  The balance beam will be with a flattened “Z” in order to stay on path.  The log beam will be about three feet off the ground; each leg should be approximately ten feet.  The monkey bar portion will be raised to level at the approach end.  Wood mulch will be used underneath.

Event #9 (Incline Walls).  Existing event will be removed and replaced with three inclined wall built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 94) spaced about eight to ten feet apart with wood mulch around.

Event #10 (Vertical Net Climb).  This is one of two major events where safety is the primary concern; safety will not be compromised.  Current event will be replaced with a 35 foot hybrid version of the typical “cargo net” climbing tower and uses the same safety features as the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  The change from that event is the “A” frame vertical posts – two posts per side to support the inverted “V” net keeping the net taunt with the help of tensioning cables.  The v-net is slightly declined to allow a falling climber to in effect slide down the net thus slowing the fall.  The net tapers outward at the bottom becoming a catch net and effectively absorbing the climbers fall.

Event #11 (Balance Beam/Swing, Stop and Jump).  This event is repaired/restored to original condition.  The improvements will include cross beam, timber pegged or through bolted and the platform built to meet general requirements.  The balance beam will be bolted mounted at both ends.  Rope replaced with 1.5 inch hemp and rubber mulch spread on swing area.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The U.S. Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to issue a modification raising the maximum order amount of an existing firm fixed price, IDIQ Contract W911W6-04-D-0008 with Chelton Inc., from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000.  This action is being accomplished in accordance with Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  Contract W911W6-04-D-0008 was awarded using this authority on a sole source basis in accordance with this same authority, only one responsible source, and was previously synopsized in FedBizOps on 30 March 2004.  This is a commercial item procurement of UHF SATCOM and Multi-Band VHF/UHF antennas for ongoing contingency operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The objective of the program is to equip designated ai rcraft communication capability with units beyond line of sight.  Market research has identified Chelton Inc., as the only responsible source for this SATCOM hardware which was previously tested with Government CONOPS and is compatible with the required ai rborne platforms, with existing mounting hardware requiring no further modification.  In addition, the Chelton components have an added benefit in that no other related devices have been previously integrated on specifically required Army rotorcraft.  The period of performance for this program is thirty-six (36) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 334220.  The size standard is 1500.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  SITUATION: Currently, an existing HF system provides limited communications connectivity between the JFHQ-HI Joint Operations Center (JOC) and facilities on four neighbor islands. However, the system is voice only, lacks standardization, difficult to opera te effectively, many components are dates and it offer no mobility to extend communications to the incident scene or command center.  DETERMINATION: In the event of a widespread communication failure, the HF network is the only system that can provide communication connectivity between the islands when all other means of communication is lost or destroyed. Natural disasters such as hurri canes or tropical storms can typically disable landline and cellular systems for days. Terrorist incidents can immobilize communications systems due to overload or possible direct attack on communications nodes. In any case, an independent and reliable com munications system is needed to support C41 requirements during incident response. The State of Hawaii consists of seven applicable islands that cover an ocean area thats approximately 300 miles long and 100 miles wide. Hawaii Army National Guard has unit s positioned on five of these islands, and each of these units is tasked with an emergency response function for local disasters.  Primary communications for data and voice is via hard wire systems.  If communications is lost between the islands, then Ha waii Army National Guard units would be severely limited in their ability to respond to local incidents. An updated and standardized HF network can provide reliable data and voice connectivity between our units on each island and significantly enhance the Hawaii Army National Guards effectiveness during incident response.  SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS: The HF Radio system is being enhanced to support the Hawaii Army National Guard with the ability to long haul voice/data communications. The system should include, but is not limited to the follow: Text messaging - The radio softwar e should support this application. 1. PC interface  Allows the radio to be controlled via the PC. 2. E-mail capability  The radio can send emails out and is compatible with LANs and WANs. 3. Must be compatible with other HF ALE radios in use. 4. The system will include the proper power supplies, antennas, mounting kits and accessories. 5. It must be capable of operating independent of the local communications infrastructure; it must be man-portable and function in all-weather conditions. OPERATIONAL CONCEPT: Each key facility will receive one HF ALE radio transceiver, one data modem/vocoder for digital voice/data, one radio programmer terminal, and appropriate power supplies/antenna equipment. This distribution will provide a voice and dat a connection between the JFHQ JOC, subordinate major commands, and each neighbor island unit.  The HF communications package for a deployable JTF will consist of one HF ALE rapid deployment package (RDP) and two HF ALE back-pack radio systems. The deployab le JTF package will provide immediate voice and data capabilities from the JFHQ JOC from the JFHQ JOC to a JTF thats deployed anywhere within the state, significantly enhancing C41 capabilities to forward forces and improving unit response in the field. SUPPORT EQUIPMENT: These radio systems are commercially-off-the-shelf systems (COTS) with a 4-year manufacturers warranty. Radio maintenance beyond operator level will be accomplished by returning the broken unit to the vendor for repair and/or replacemen t. New equipment training is provided by the manufacturer for the radio system purchased. Sustainment training will be accomplished throu gh train-the-trainer concept. FOB Point Destination:     Delivery and acceptance for all items will be in Honolulu, Hawaii 96816. DELIVERY- Provide consolidated shipment at one time specify that. Otherwise provide estimated delivery within the CLIN.  NOTES: Provide primary General Schedule for order. Identify other General Schedules in CLIN or identify Open Market per that CLIN as applicable.  FREIGHT: Provide if cost is separate of CLIN items.
