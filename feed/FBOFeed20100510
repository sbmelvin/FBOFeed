<DESC>1. REGIONAL ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT INFORMATION. This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) to provide for the primary disciplines of Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by September 2010. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is restricted to HUBZone businesses only. The Government may award multiple contracts in response to this announcement at any time until one year from the closing date of this announcement. Selection shall be in order of preference from the firms considered Most Highly Qualified. All interested A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small, disadvantaged firms. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330, and the corresponding small business size standard is $4.5 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year with four, one-year option periods, an annual contract value of $1 million, and a total IDC value not to exceed $5 million. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted. USDA APHIS currently has, and may award in the future, IDC contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement. The selection board chair will consider the selection criteria below in deciding which contractor(s) will be selected. If more than one firm is selected, the top-ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined by the employees' office location (not the location of the work).<br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Regional A/E will include Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural work for the preparation of contract drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and possible associated services such as: LEED design services, NEPA documentation and environmental assessments, designer of record services, commissioning, value engineering, design (peer) review, master planning, facility inspection for deficiencies, obtaining various required permits, construction management, geotechnical investigations, surveying, and performing Construction Inspection Contractor (CIC) services. CIC services may or may not be related to work designed by said firm if and when used. Projects will cover a variety of building types nationwide, such as offices, laboratory, animal and plant inspection stations, quarantine stations, and general utility buildings. Some work may involve only one or two disciplines, i.e., Mechanical/Electrical, where repair and/or remodeling are involved and other types of work might include incinerators, fumigation hoods, compressed gas facilities, water and sewer mains, and water treatment facilities. Some of our major facilities are located in Mission, TX; Ames, IA; Newburg, NY; Fort Collins, CO; Miami, FL; and Beltsville, MD. New buildings generally will be in the $100,000 to $5,000,000 cost range. Repair and remodeling work varies from a few thousand to $500,000 cost range.

<DESC>CMS intends to award one or more contracts for Grouper Episode for Medicine. This is a full and open competition. Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract(s).
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Policy makers have expressed concerns that the current Medicare payment system includes incentives that encourage physicians to overuse some services and underuse others, pays physicians for care irrespective of their level of resource use, and offers higher revenues to physicians who furnish more services, regardless of whether they add value (MedPAC 2008). To remedy these concerns, the concept of value based purchasing (VBP) has been introduced into the policy arena. The goal of a VBP program is to provide information to providers to encourage more efficiency and to find ways to reward physicians financially for efficient use of resources and providing high quality care. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop a plan that will transition Medicare payments into a VBP program for physician and other professional services. Such a program will pay based on efficiency and the quality of services provided. The Act also requires DHHS to disseminate confidential feedback reports to physicians using episode groupers and/or per capita cost measures.</p>
<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) has the following provision in Sec 3003 IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PHYSICIAN FEEDBACK PROGRAM: The Secretary shall develop an episode grouper that combines separate but clinically related items and services into an episode of care for an individual, as appropriate. The episode grouper shall be developed by not later than January 1, 2012. The episode grouper is also integral to the technology required to fulfill Sec. 3007. VALUE-BASED PAYMENT MODIFIER UNDER THE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE. This section requires the Secretary to establish a payment modifier that provides for differential payments to a physician or a group of physicians for all services furnished under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). The differential payments would be made based on the quality of care furnished compared to cost.</p>
<p>CMS has been investigating techniques that can help identify higher cost practice patterns among physicians. One technique is to compare resource use at the episode of care level. Episodes of care represent a group of healthcare services (claims) for a health condition (e.g., hip fracture, diabetes) over a defined period of time for which a physician can be held responsible. Episode groupers are software programs that organize claims data into a set of clinically coherent episodes, usually linked by diagnoses. Episode grouping software requires users to specify the input parameters for a given set of outputs or data points produced by the software. The user determines the types of claims data that will be grouped, the time frames for which the data are collected, the various software profile settings, the physician attribution and benchmarking algorithms, and the information and resource metrics that will be provided to clinicians, among other decisions. Because of this flexibility and the substantial user discretion, no one correct episode grouping method exists.</p>
<p>In the two commercial grouping software products evaluated by Acumen, LLC under contract to CMS, episode types are characterized as chronic, acute, or preventive care. Chronic condition episodes typically are administratively defined for episode grouping purposes as having a 12-month duration, usually a calendar year. Acute episodes have no administratively-imposed time limits. Acute and preventive care episodes are generally much shorter in duration than chronic episodes, and are considered complete or "closed" when there is no activity within a given period. For example, if 90 days is set as the "clean period" for an episode related to hip fracture, and no claims listing a diagnosis of hip fracture are encountered 90 days after a claim in which hip fracture is diagnosed or treated, then the episode is deemed complete. Only certain claim types can initiate or open an episode. Physician Part B evaluation and management claims or surgery claims, an inpatient hospitalization, or a skilled nursing facility stay can start an episode. Ancillary claims and durable medical equipment claims cannot start an episode in either existing episode grouper, while home health claims and hospice claims may start an episode in one of the episode groupers studied. Since a person can be treated for more than one condition at the same time, episodes may be open simultaneously for different conditions.</p>
<p>The first CMS report on episode groupers by Acumen, LLC, entitled "Evaluating the Functionality of the Symmetry ETG and Medstat MEG Software in Forming Episodes of Care Using Medicare Data," concludes that 1) the grouping algorithms do not emulate physician practice patterns common in the Medicare system, 2) inpatient physician services often do not group with the associated hospital stays, and 3) there is considerable variation in costs within episodes and within episode types." This large variation in episode costs "...suggests the need to develop models of risk or severity adjustment applicable for Medicare populations prior to being able to use the episodes software for profiling Medicare providers".</p>
<p>A second CMS report by Acumen, entitled "Prototype Medicare Resource Utilization Report Based on Episode Groupers," discusses practical aspects of implementing resource utilization reports using episode groupers. The user shall determine how to apportion costs into episodes, risk adjust costs if necessary, assign physicians to those episodes, and define relevant peer groups for the purpose of comparing physicians' costs to each other. Empirical analysis is performed on the number of episodes required for valid comparisons among physicians). Determination and use of options is determined by the user.</p>
<p>On November 10, 2009, CMS hosted a public listening session on the design of a public domain episode grouper. This listening session solicited stakeholder comments on the range of issues in the analysis of the applicability of currently available tools to identify discrete episodes of care for Medicare beneficiaries. The url announcing the listening session is located at: http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-22959.pdf . The background information for the Session, including a white paper and PowerPoint slides can be found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/downloads/Listening_Session_Slides_2009-11-10_508_compliant.pdf . This procurement continues the process of developing a public use episode grouping software.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Approach A</p>
<p>The goal of Approach A is to modify an existing episode grouping software product for use in the Medicare program. The grouping processes and logic shall be readily understandable, transparent, and comprehensible to multiple stakeholders, including physicians, policy makers, and administrators. The logic shall be valid and reliable, and have a reasonable number of homogenous cost groupings (not thousands).</p>
<p>Conceptually, episode grouping is comprised of three sub-systems or modules: clinical logic, episode construction logic, and the risk adjustment method. Clinical logic refers to the basic framework for clustering, the rationale for grouping of condition codes, grouping algorithms, co-morbidities, hierarchy of grouping codes, acute exacerbations, signs and symptom diagnosis, disease interactions, and possibly severity levels (depending on the structure of the system). Episode construction logic establishes the processes and rules by which claims are grouped using the clinical logic.</p>
<p>Each of these subsystems can stand on its own, or be integrated with the other components into a software program that groups claims into episodes. Approach A is organized by these sub-systems. This procurement is only for episode grouping software and its components. Elements of a profiling system (attribution rules, benchmarking, standardized costs, etc.) may be considered in the design of data items that will be part of the grouper software's output design. Use of these elements will be determined by the vendor in collaboration with CMS.</p>
<p>Approach B</p>
<p>The goal of Approach B is to construct a new comprehensive public domain episode grouper. The grouping processes and logic shall be readily understandable, transparent, and comprehensible to the intended audience of physicians, policy makers, and health care administrators. It shall be valid and reliable, and have a reasonable number of homogenous episode groupings (not thousands). <br /><br />Conceptually, episode grouping is comprised of three sub-systems or modules: clinical logic, episode construction logic, and the risk adjustment method.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract(s). However, the Government reserves the right to negotiate different type of Contract(s).</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is estimated as follows:</p>
<p>APPROACH A</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the base period may be awarded to more than one contractor. The period of performance for the base period is 15 months; the period of performance for the Option, if exercised, is 24 months.</p>
<p>APPROACH B</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the base period will be awarded to more than one contractor. The period of performance for the base period will not exceed 15 months; and the period of performance for the option period, if exercised, will not exceed 48 months.</p>
<p><br />This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in late May or early June 2010 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fbo.gov.</p>

<DESC>Description of Work:  The purpose of this contract is to provide lookout services to detect and report smokes or fires within and adjacent to the Umatilla National Forest. Lookout will be required to maintain a daily log of events and provide a written summary of events at the end of each contract year. Work will include monitoring radio traffic; relaying radio messages, plotting fire start locations, providing fire behavior reports, report state of the weather and take weather readings when requested. 

This will be a 3 year lookout services IDIQ contract with 1 base year and 2 option years. Services shall be required from approximately July 1 until October 31 of each year.  Each year will be started by issuance of a task order by the Government.  

Services will be required 7 days per week, from 0900 to 1800 hours, with additional work (overtime) when requested, approximately 25 hours per year . There may be opportunities to schedule days off during the scheduled period of performance, but those days must be agreed to by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) in advance.  The COR may cancel scheduled days off at the last minute, should circumstances arise requiring lookout services.

Oregon Butte Lookout is located on the Pomeroy Ranger District, Pomeroy Washington, at Township 7 North, Range 41 East, Section 4, at approximately 6000 feet in elevation.

Access:
From the Eckler Mountain Road located in Dayton, WA.  Follow road about 15 miles (heading east) to a stone monument located at the junction of Eckler Mountain Rd. and Kendall Skyline rd. (F.S. road #46).  From there turn right (south) on to Kendall Skyline #46 for 12 miles to Godman Guard Station.  Turn left (east) below Godman on to Rd. #4608.  Take all main right turns for 5 miles to Teepee Trailhead.  From Teepee Trailhead hike 3 miles to Oregon Butte Lookout on Oregon Butte Trail #3134. 

Considerations: 
Oregon Butte is in the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness, no motorized or wheeled access exists from Tee Pee Trailhead to Lookout facility. The Oregon Butte trail is only maintained for foot and pack string use since it is located within the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness.  Oregon Butte Trail #3134, begins at Teepee Trailhead and climbs and descends over ridges, draws and through saddles with slope grades ranging from 0 to 40% for 2.5 miles towards a log water trough.  From there the trail climbs for 0.5 miles to Oregon Butte Lookout.  

This distance can be traversed in 1 to 2 hours depending on conditions of trail, weather, time of day and level of fitness of the individual.

Access to local communities, to obtain supplies requires most part of a day.

Serving as a Lookout at Oregon Butte requires living in a 14 by 16 area for long periods of time and will/may require staffing extended hours, throughout the contract period. 

Extremes in weather conditions occur due to the Lookouts location and elevation.

Approved water source for consumption and use is located at Godman Guard Station.  Water must be hauled from Godman Guard Station to Lookout by the Contractor.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP) plans to procure on a sole source basis the services of The Journal of Preventative Medicine, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, DEPT 0811; La Jolla, CA 92093-0811 to publish information on Cyberinfrastructure and Consumer Health.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).<span>&nbsp; </span>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.<span>&nbsp; </span>This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this requisition is to produce a special publication for the scientific community on a topic of key interest to the Behavioral Research Program/DCCPS/NCI and the NIH. Specifically, the special supplement will discuss the outcomes from the following NCI sponsored events: March 2008 Expert Panel Workshop on Cyberinfrastructure for Behavioral Medicine at the University of California San Diego (co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation), January 2009/10 symposia and mini-tracks on cyberinfrastructure for public health at the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science, and November 2009 Informatics for Consumer Health Summit in Potomac, MD (co-sponsored by HHS and NIH).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 18.7pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The articles for the supplemental issue will be based on the presentations and breakout group discussions fostered at these events , as well as additional commentaries regarding topics that were determined to be absent from the presentations. This special issue will be distributed to both research and policy-oriented stakeholders, and will help disseminate important multi-disciplinary research gathered at these events. The primary goal of the publication will be to compile thought-provoking topics to inform a wide audience and initiate action to enhance the state of technology and policy for consumer health.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 18.7pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine (AJPM)</em> publishes original, peer-reviewed articles in the areas of prevention research, teaching, practice and policy. Research papers and issues with special themes such as ehealth technologies and behavioral informatics, cutting edge areas pertinent to behavioral medicine and population health are also periodically published in AJPM, making this journal an ideal vehicle for research and policy-based articles on cyberinfrastructure and consumer health informatics. As an interdisciplinary journal, AJPM is read by behavioral, clinical, biomedical, and social scientists including those with expertise and research foci on health informatics for preventive health.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, AJPM specifically targets both new and experienced scientists, enabling those researchers with less experience in transdisciplinary science to potentially pursue collaborative research activities. This very specific combination of experience and expertise is not otherwise available within the scientific publication community.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with North Carolina State University, Nuclear Energy Services, Department of Nuclear Engineering, Raleigh, NC to provide non-destructive elemental analyses by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) Gamma Spectrometry of 730 environmental and biological samples that are needed as part of an ongoing study of the bioavailability of metalloids (e.g., arsenic) and metals (e.g., cadmium) in soil samples.NC State, Department of Nuclear Engineering has previously provided elemental analysis of environmental and biological samples collected in this research which provides a benchmark for analyses performed under this study.  Samples have a finite shelf life and need to be processed in the same manner, by the same vendor to ensure quality of data and continuity of service.  Having these samples processed by a different vendor would affect the scientific quality of the data and render the results of analysis useless. Therefore, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for these particular samples.  The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" at this time is FAR 13.501(a), "sole source".  The anticipated period of performance is a 12 month base period with one (1) additional 12 month option period.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Title: Multi-component evaluation of the BodyWorks program 
Contracting Office Address: Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857 

Notification of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract: The Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Womens Health (OWH) intends to award a sole source contract to Shattuck and Associates for the multi-component evaluation of the BodyWorks program.

Background information on the BodyWorks program: Through the BodyWorks program, OWH seeks to provide parents/caregivers with tools and strategies to improve family eating and activity habits.  The BodyWorks program is designed to support adolescent girls and boys in reaching and maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity.  Launched in 2006, the program is based on research suggesting that parents/caregivers play an important role in shaping the nutrition and physical activity patterns of their children; adolescents are less likely to be overweight or obese if their parents maintain a healthy weight; and parent participation in childhood obesity prevention programs has been shown to have a positive effect on program success.  The primary audience for the program is parents/caregivers of adolescent girls and boys.  The secondary audiences are adolescents and other family members.  BodyWorks programs are led by trained facilitators and are intended to include ten parent-focused sessions lasting 90 minutes each.  Adolescents are invited to two of the sessions.  The BodyWorks program includes English and Spanish versions.  More information about the program can be found at www.womenshealth.gov/bodyworks.  OWH needs to know how the program is being implemented, which aspects are perceived as successful and which are not, as well as whether it is effective in changing health behaviors initially and at a 6 month follow-up.  

Specifically, Shattuck and Associates will evaluate 1) participant and trainer perspectives on the implementation of the BodyWorks program; 2) whether BodyWorks is associated with changes in behavior and if so, whether that change is sustained at a 6 month follow-up; 3) the comparative effect of the BodyWorks and Best Bones Forever programs (which of these programs has better outcomes); and 4) trainer perspectives on the Technical Assistance component to BodyWorks.. 

Shattuck and Associates is currently under contract to evaluate the Best Bones Forever pilot program. The Best Bones Forever pilot operates as a subcomponent of the BodyWorks program. Best Bones Forever is a more intensive version of BodyWorks, with a physical activity program for girls. One of the goals of the BodyWorks evaluation is to compare outcomes of BodyWorks with Best Bones Forever date to learn which of the programs leads to better results. The Government will use information from the comparison of these programs to determine which program to continue to support, if either. 

Shattuck and Associates is uniquely poised to complete the outlined tasks since they have an intricate understanding of the BodyWorks program and have the Best Bones Forever data. It is essential that data from the BodyWorks evaluation is collected, cleaned and formatted like the Best Bones Forever data. Only by using the same firm are we assured that the methodological and technical details of the data collections and tabulation will be statistically appropriate for the necessary comparisons. With more than one firmed involved, we would risk deviations in the implementation and analysis details that could compromise the ability for the government to learn which program, if either, should be supported. Shattuck and Associates is a women-owned small business with extensive expertise in evaluation research.  

Any firm that believes it may have similar capabilities is encouraged to submit their capability statement addressing each of the items/areas cited above. Written capability statements may not exceed ten (10) pages and must be received by the contracting officer not later than 5:00 p.m. EDT on May 24, 2010. Small Businesses are encouraged to review this notice. E-MAIL CAPABILITY STATEMENT TO: Rebecca.Hoffman@psc.hhs.gov

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. No solicitation document is available at this time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For further information, contact Rebecca Hoffman at DHHS/PSC/SAS/DAM, Parklawn Building, Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-7078.

The RFP will be available for issuance on or about 6/22/2010. The technical and price proposals will be due on or about 8/2/2010.</p>
<p>In accordance with GSA policy, the RFP will be issued electronically via FEDBIZOPPS (www.fbo.gov). This site provides instructions for downloading the RFP and for obtaining the design documents. The plans and specifications are going to be issued electronically through secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS). FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies. In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR. The Central Contractor<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an E-Gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity. Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award. You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov. You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled Register with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink.</p>
<p>At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: (Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's, CCR Point of Contact) your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&amp;B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address. Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specialist whose name appears herein. Offerors are strongly encouraged to register to receive notification of upload the RFP at this site and register on the Interested Vendor List (IVL). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.</p>

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT


C-1 	INTRODUCTION AND LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
	
A. On the basis of extensive congressional testimony and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) consultation with experts on war-related readjustment difficulties, the character of "readjustment counseling" was established during a 10-year legislative history between 1969 and 1979. In 1979, the Congress passed, and the President signed, Public Law 96-22, which added to 38 U.S.C., Section 1712A, providing readjustment counseling to any eligible Vietnam Era veteran. As implemented by the VA in 1979, readjustment counseling is provided through a nation-wide system of community-based Vet Centers. In 1982, the VA initiated a new organizational element, RCS (Readjustment Counseling Service), to administer the Vet Centers and the provision of readjustment counseling.

B. The term "readjustment counseling" means: Individual, group, and family counseling, employment counseling, benefits counseling, and referral services for eligible veterans who have psychosocial problems as part of readjustment to civilian life after military duty during specified conflicts. The counseling may include traditional psychotherapeutic modalities, but the purpose of psychotherapy (or any modality) must be, as a primary task, to address readjustment difficulties derived from military duties and the homecoming experience. 

C. A counseling session or initial assessment shall last a minimum of 60 minutes and shall be deemed a single visit. (Longer visits shall be deemed a single visit, regardless of length.) 

D. Group sessions will be reimbursed at the rate of 37.5% of the basic per-session reimbursement rate, per veteran. All group sessions shall last a minimum of 90 minutes per session.  See Sections C and attachments for additional information.

E. Policy and Authority
	
             In April 1991, Congress amended 38 U.S.C. 1712A to authorize VA to furnish 
readjustment counseling to veterans of the Persian Gulf War and the conflicts in Lebanon, Grenada and Panama. The Law further authorized VA to furnish, by contract with approved private sector providers, readjustment counseling to eligible veterans where VA cannot provide such services. Contract program operations are the responsibility of a coordinated effort by Vet Center staff and VA Medical Center officials.
             
             In October 1997, Congress amended 38 U.S.C. 1712A to expand eligibility
for readjustment counseling at Vet Centers to any veteran who served in the active military,  in a theater of combat operations during a period of war, or in any other area during a period in which hostilities occurred in such area. The law specified that the term "hostilities" means any armed conflict in which the members of the Armed Forces are subjected to danger comparable to a period of war, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Defense. Under the amended law, veterans who served during the Vietnam Era, but not in a theater of combat operations, will continue to be eligible for readjustment counseling if they seek or are furnished such counseling before January 1, 2000.


C-2  	ELIGIBILITY FOR COUNSELING SERVICES

A.	Eligibility

1. Public Laws 104-262, 104-275 that extends definition of era for war zone veterans; and the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1997, require VA to provide readjustment counseling services for:

1.1.	War Zone Veterans - all eras, including:

2. Eligible veterans must also have been discharged under Honorable Conditions or with a character of service for which basic eligibility to receive VA benefits has been established through adjudicative decision by VA (e.g. in the case of veterans possessing Undesirable Discharges, Bad Conduct Discharges, or General Discharges Under Other than Honorable Conditions).

3.   Veterans possessing a Dishonorable Discharge are NOT eligible for services provided under this program.

4.	Eligibility will be verified by the VA through submission of information
sufficient to identify the veteran to VA Outreach for verification of basic eligibility in order to expedite referrals for counseling services under this program.

5.	In those situations where eligibility cannot be verified prior to authorization, 
the VA employee making the referral may authorize the referral to the Contractor on the basis of presumptive eligibility, if it is clinically determined that an emergency exists requiring provision of immediate readjustment counseling services. In such cases, the VA referrer will inform the veteran that if eligibility is not substantiated, the veteran will be billed for all counseling services received.

C-3	REFERRALS AND AUTHORIZATION FOR COUNSELING SERVICES

A.	Referrals to readjustment counseling contract providers may be made by:

1.	Qualified Vet Center staff.

2.	VHA (Veterans Health Administration) qualified mental health professionals
(Psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or a psychiatric nurse clinical specialist) at VA Health Care facilities. All referrals made by VHA mental health professionals who are not Vet Center staff, will be closely coordinated with the Vet Center Team Leader/COTR (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative), as the latter will assume responsibility for monitoring the case once the referral is made.

B.	Contract readjustment counseling includes the same mix of social and psychological
services as provided at Vet Centers, with the exception of community outreach. The purpose of the contract program, as intended by Congress and implemented by the VA, is for the provision of readjustment counseling and not for general mental health services. Contract readjustment counseling may include social services and/or psychotherapy, but the services provided must address readjustment difficulties deriving from military duties and/or homecoming experiences. The provision of services for problems not having a clear and distinct relationship to military duty and readjustment to civilian life from military duty is not authorized.

C.	Specifically, the difficulties which comprise war-related readjustment difficulties referable to a contract provider are the following:

1.	Psychosocial problems related to exposure to war trauma.

2.	Psychosocial problems related to other stressful experiences of military duty in a
war-zone.

3.	Psychosocial problems related to post-war adjustment to civilian family and work
roles.

4.	Psychosocial problems related to type of military discharge.

5.	Psychosocial problems related to substance abuse clinically associated with
military duty or post-military readjustment.

6.	Psychosocial problems related to post-war homecoming experiences.

7.	Psychosocial concern over possible exposure to chemical and/or biological 
agents in the war-zone.

8.	Generalized alienation from society related to interruption in the normal post-war
readjustment process.

D.	Prior to making a referral, the veteran must be interviewed by the VA referrer.

1.	Although this may be either in person or by telephone, the referrer is 
responsible for ensuring that eligibility definition and clinical assessment requirements are met. The clinical evidence should establish that the veteran's problems are clearly related to the military experience, be reflected in the reason for referral, and be documented in the veteran's record.

2.	Self-referrals and referrals of veterans who were or are in the private contract
provider's caseload cannot be authorized, unless the assessment described above is carried out. In no event may the VA be billed or required to pay for services delivered prior to the authorization for care.

3.	After eligibility has been verified and the need for readjustment counseling 
Clinically established, the Vet Center Team Leader/COTR or other VA referrer will    complete and sign VA Form 10-5565B, Vietnam Veterans Outreach Program Contract Service Authorization, which officially effects a referral to the contract service provider. The completion and disposition of VA Form 10-5565B is to be implemented according to the instructions on the form.

E.	Referrals and ongoing assessment of counseling cases will be managed so as to ensure the availability of services to the largest number of eligible veterans within the limits of available resources.

1. Brief therapy will be provided whenever clinically feasible to facilitate
serving the largest number of eligible veterans. Theater veterans exposed to war-zone stress will be considered the highest priority recipients for contract readjustment counseling.

2. Group counseling will be encouraged whenever clinically or logistically
feasible as this method is both clinically indicated and cost effective for veterans with readjustment difficulties. The composition of such groups must include at least 50 percent eligible war-zone veterans for a contract provider to be reimbursed for the group counseling session. The VA referrer may grant exceptions to this when clinically indicated.

3. In accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract, the Professional
Services Letter IL-11-82-26, and the VA Form 10-5565B, the contract provider (Contractor) shall be required to perform as follows:

a.	All initial referrals to a contract provider will be for up to 3 visits for
clinical assessment and brief counseling. The VA referrer will specify on VA Form 10-5565B; one, two or three visits and the type of counseling to be provided (individual, group, etc.).

b.	The contract provider shall schedule the initial veteran counseling 
session (visit) within 5 working days from the date the veteran was first referred under the contract.  A visit will last a minimum of 60 minutes. A group-counseling visit will last a minimum of 90 minutes.

c.	If additional visits are required upon completion of the 3 initial visits,
the VA referrer will obtain from the contract provider a counseling plan documenting the need for continuing readjustment counseling.


4. After reviewing the plan, the VA referrer may authorize the veteran for up to a 
block of 15 additional visits. In similar fashion, subsequent re-authorizations are established for a finite period (up to 15 visits) and case counseling plans are subject to evaluation prior to further authorization. Effective management of case progress and available funding requires that VA referrers specify on the VA Form 10-5565B, a time period within which a block of authorized visits must be delivered. For example, a veteran may be authorized a block of 15 weekly sessions to be used within a two-quarter period. If the veteran does not use all 15 sessions during the specified time, he may be reviewed and re-authorized for additional visits at the beginning of the next quarter.

5. The counseling plan may be presented to the referrer orally, not later than the
completion of the third initial visit, but shall be followed with a written copy and this plan shall be documented in the veteran's record by the referrer. The VA reserves the right to modify the treatment plan submitted by the Contractor. Coordination of the counseling plans to the VA referrer must occur in a timely manner so there will be no disruption in the continuation of readjustment counseling.

6. "Significant Others" (that is, members of the veteran's immediate family,
legal guardian, or individual with whom the veteran lives or certifies an intention to live), may be seen conjointly with a veteran in couple or family counseling by the contract service provider.

a.	This will be limited to counseling for problems that have a distinct
relationship to the veteran's readjustment from military duty.

b.	For couple or family counseling, billing and reimbursement will be at the
established per session rate as specified in the contract.

c.	Significant others may be seen without the veteran present only when
clinically required as an integral part of couple or family counseling. Such visits by significant others without the veteran present however, are limited to one visit per ten couple or family sessions. Exceptions may be granted to the limitation on significant other visits only when clinically approved by the VA referrer.

7.  As stipulated in the contract, there is a provision that limits eligibility for
readjustment counseling through a contract provider to 1 year from the time of the veteran's first visit.

a.	This provision is based upon existing knowledge regarding the etiology
and longitudinal course of war-related readjustment difficulties to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and upon program experience that indicates that most veterans referred complete services within 1 year.

b.	This provision should not be implemented in an arbitrary manner nor
should it be applied in isolation from other indicators for clinical case progress.

c.	If longer term extension of authorization is necessary, the following
procedures will be followed:

	The Vet Center Team Leader/COTR will interview the veteran (in person or by telephone) to conduct an updated, comprehensive psychosocial assessment to ensure continuing clinical need for readjustment counseling.

	If there is clinical indication for continuing readjustment counseling beyond 1 year, the Vet Center Team Leader/COTR must consult with the Assistant Regional Manager for Contract Services prior to authorizing continuing visits. 

	All requests for readjustment counseling beyond 1 year, for more than brief transitioning purposes, must be reviewed and approved by the RCS regional manger or designee, and documented in the veteran's clinical record.

8.  If a veteran currently receiving readjustment counseling from a previous 
contract provider resides in a closer proximity to a newly selected contract provider; the veteran may be transferred to the new contract provider in order to continue uninterrupted counseling from the most convenient service provider.

9.  There is no obligation under this contract for the VA to provide any specific number of referrals to any contractor.

F.  The VA referrer will define the exact counseling record information to be included by the contract provider upon each veteran's counseling session(s).

1.	Verification Form: At the completion of each counseling session or 
group therapy, the Contractor shall document on the VA Form 10-5565B, the name of the veteran or client, as well as length, date, and specific modality of the counseling session. The form will then be forwarded to the COTR for processing (see sample form at Attachment A).

a.	A separate verification form is to be completed for each veteran for 
Each month, and attached to the monthly bill. The Contractor shall secure a signed acknowledgment of services from each client and for each visit for which they are invoicing the VA.

b.	Provide only those services identified on the VA referral form.

c.	Client numbers and records for significant others will be maintained 
	                    in the name of the veteran; however, counseling case notes/progress             
                                notes on visits by significant others should be maintained as discrete  
                                and separate from the veteran's notes for continuity of notation, and so  
                                they can be easily extracted if a request for the veteran's counseling   
                                record is made.

2.	Contractor shall maintain accurate and complete counseling records, which comply with the confidentiality requirements of Public Law 93-282 and the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579. Contractor shall ensure the physical security of records and the prevention of disclosure of the records, reports, or other private information of clients except with the client's informed, written consent.

Note:  Counseling records are considered the property of the VA.  One year following expiration of the contract, the contractor shall turn the client folder over to the authorizing Vet Center, or contact the Regional Manager of the Vet Center to determine to which Vet Center the folder should be sent.  The same procedures will apply when the contract between the VA and the Contractor terminates.

Note:    The VA will provide all required forms.

<DESC><p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, Maryland, intends to negotiate a on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b), with Gamma Products, Inc. for a low level Automatic Alpha/Beta Counting System with the following features:<br />1. Dual wire gas flow sample detector with gas flow guard.<br />2. Multi-channel analysis for alpha and beta discrimination. <br />3. The modular nature of the Gamma Product unit's detector mounts makes it simple to replace detectors as needed, e.g., field replaceable by in-house personnel, as the unit requires minimal disassembly to replace detectors.<br />4. PC-based storage for sample data as well as DVD storage of sample data.<br />5. Automatic HV plateau generation, Chi-Square testing, and system diagnostics.<br />6. Sample carriers do not require the use of bar coded stickers.<br />7. No router and routing software is required between system components.<br />8. Expected lifetime of this unit under anticipated operating conditions is 20+ years.</p>
<p>This supply will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The sole source determination is based on Gamma Products offering detector modularity, storage of sample data, as well as automated systems diagnostics as outlined above, therefore it is determined to be the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government. This item utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3824 and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p>Gamma Products, Inc. Model G5020C is utilized by Health Physics personnel, reactor staff, and research staff to analyze samples for removable alpha and/or beta contamination resulting from work with alpha-emitting radionuclides, e.g., depleted uranium or transuranics (plutonium, americium, californium, neptunium), or radioactive contamination resulting from neutron activation of reactor components, protocol experimental elements, or reactor-produced byproduct material. This equipment forms the backbone of the radioactive contamination monitoring and control programs at the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI). Use of this equipment permits Health Physics to reduce potential exposure of personnel to radioactive contamination, thus complimenting our scientific support mission.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide a low level Automatic Alpha/Beta Counting System solution that includes all features as outlined above. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to carolyn.lisovich@usuhs.mil. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 17 May 2010, 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.</p>

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), PMM-131, Reconnaissance and Amphibious Raids (RAR) intends to issue an award as an Other Than Full An Open Competition to SAFE Boats International, LLC to procure up to nine (9) Open Water Safety Craft (OWSC) (part number 31EMT) with trailers, accessories, spare parts, commercial manuals, and shipping. The total estimated award value is anticipated to be $3, 000,000.00.  The contemplated contract type being considered for award is firm fixed price with a 19 month period of performance.  The NAICS code is 336612 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. Section 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition regulations (FAR) 6.302-1.  The OWSC is an aluminum hulled safety craft with a 33.6 feet length overall and a 10 foot beam that is capable of providing support to all waterborne training evolutions to include small craft, dive, and parachute operations near water.  The OWSC is neither deployable nor used for combat operations.  It possesses integrated commercial communication and navigation systems to provide its crew the necessary situational awareness to respond to, and aid disabled craft or injured personnel.  It provides space for a two (2) crew, 2 casualties on Stokes litter, six additional passengers and one  medical staff to allow for treatment and transportation of casualties/recovered personnel.  The OWSC has a climate controlled cabin for medical casualty triage for 2 personnel, access doors to allow wave top retrieval of in-water casualties, a bow door, and twin counter rotating outboard engines.  The SAFE Boats International 31' Full Cabin EMT craft was selected and 16 craft were competitively procured and fielded in 2006 under contract number N00024-06-F-2275 with three  more procured as follow-on in 2007 under contract number N00024-07-F-2211.  SAFE Boats International uses computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing.  This capability provides the ability to exactly replicate the OWSC previously procured.  The OWSC is a standard safety boat fielded to reconnaissance, special operations, and training commands in the Marine Corps.  Procuring the identical craft, (with the exception of commercial systems which have been upgraded since the original procurements) to meet the updated UTR, will maintain a standard craft configuration for trained boat coxswains.  This will ease the unit sustainment training burden as personnel transfer between units.  There are no other boat manufacturers with the patented flotation collar technology as SAFE Boats International.
A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST) is the scientific support organization for the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) division of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) (also known as the National Plant Germplasm and Biotechnology Laboratory [NPGBL]), located at BARC- East Bldg -580 Beltsville, MD 20705, investigates cutting-edge methods and technology from the fields of plant pathology, molecular biology, human and animal clinical diagnostics, and bio-defense to develop, adapt and improve methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis of plant pathogens. Our scientists validate and simplify biochemical and molecular diagnostics prior to stakeholder release and develop clear standard operating procedures. We achieve timely delivery of diagnostics and evaluate, adapt, and implement progressive technologies that are field-deployable and uncomplicated in its operation for emergency response, and eradication and domestic programs.<br />ISO/IEC 17025 is an international standard used by testing and calibration laboratories. This standard is composed of two major components: (1) management requirements and (2) technical requirements. Management requirements are primarily related to the operation and effectiveness of the quality management system within the laboratory. This includes an emphasis on the responsibilities of senior management, explicit requirements for continual improvement of the management system itself, and communication with the customer. Technical requirements address the competence of staff, methodology, equipment, quality of test results and reporting.<br />Accreditation to the ISO/IEC 17025 international standard will be a formal, international recognition that the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) is technically capable and competent to perform the work identified in their accreditation scope. Because the mission of the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) for PPQ includes response to plant pathogens exotic to the U.S. or new to science, the development of a &lsquo;flexible' scope for Accreditation under the ISO/IEC 17025 international standard is the most appropriate Quality Assurance approach.<br />Objective</p>
<p>ISO 17025:2005 accreditation for the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) for a fixed and flexible scope covering "quantitative and qualitative detection of plant pathogens using conventional and real-time PCR". (Conventional PCR includes simplex, multiplex, nested and reverse transcription PCR assays; Real-time PCR includes TaqMan&reg; and SYBR-G technologies in simplex, multiplex, and reverse transcription PCR assays.) Including a flexible scope will allow us to be more responsive to PPQ and afford us the opportunity to modify and/or extend the range of our accredited PCR assays and add new technically-equivalent assays between surveillance visits.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work</p>
<p>1. Introductory Visit: During this visit, the proposed scope of accreditation will be discussed and reviewed. The accrediting body will explain the accreditation process and answer any questions that the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) may have concerning accreditation to the ISO 17025:2005 standard. The accrediting body will tour the facility and point out any obvious non-conformances at that time. The accrediting body will sign and provide a copy of the Confidentiality and Conflict of Interest Statement.</p>
<p>2. Document Review: Upon receipt of documentation from the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) (NPGBL), the accrediting body will perform an evaluation to begin the determination of conformance of the laboratory management system to the ISO 17025:2005 requirements. The accrediting body will deliver to CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) (NPGBL) a document review report indicating which requirements are adequately addressed and a summary of any issues. This report includes the use of the ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation checklist, which shows a clause by clause and paragraph by paragraph review by the accrediting body's assessor.</p>
<p>3. Planning Visit: The accrediting body will visit the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) to review resolution of any issues from the document review and to verify that other documentation exists supporting the laboratory's management system. The accrediting body's assessor will also perform sample assessment questioning. This allows the assessor to judge if the laboratory is ready for the accreditation assessment. This planning visit is also used to enable the assessor to prepare the plan and schedule for the formal assessment. The accrediting body will provide the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) with a planning visit report. This report will contain the laboratory's scope and scope description as it is to be formally listed on the accreditation certificate, as appropriate, the status of any document review issues, and any new issues that may have arisen during the planning visit.</p>
<p>4. Accreditation Assessment: The accreditation assessment will be conducted in accordance with the accrediting body's documented procedure. Each type of PCR test(s) shall be sampled and to the extent possible, representative samples of the laboratory's technicians are witnessed performing the accredited procedures. The assessment is used to determine if the laboratory has effectively implemented its quality management system and documentation. The assessment team will document how the laboratory complies with each ISO 17025:2005 requirement using their own organization's documented checklists. Findings will be classified in one of three categories: major nonconformance, minor nonconformance, or opportunity for improvement.</p>
<p>The laboratory will receive a detailed accreditation assessment report. This report will contain details about the scope of accreditation, identification and information about the assessors, a summary of the assessment results, and copies of each finding. The report will also include copies of the assessors' accreditation checklist and any notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Accreditation Decision: The accrediting body will review the recommendation of the assessment team and will ensure that all accreditation requirements have been met and are properly documented in accordance with their documented procedures. The accrediting body will notify the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory (NPGBL) when the accreditation decision has been made.</p>
<p>7. Surveillance audits will ensure that all elements of the CPHST Beltsville Laboratory's (NPGBL) quality management system are assessed over the two year audit cycle.</p>
<p>8. Period of Performance</p>
<p>The timeline for the activities outlined above is as such:<br />a. Introductory Visit Month 1<br />b. Document Review Month 2<br />c. Planning Visit Month 3<br />d. Accreditation Assessment Month 4<br />e. Issuance of Accreditation Certificate - within 30 days of initial assessment<br />f. Surveillance Assessment (12 months following initial assessment) <br />g. Re-Accreditation Assessment (24 months following initial assessment)<br />h. Surveillance Assessment (36 months following initial assessment)</p>
<p><br />Contract Scope</p>
<p>The contract fee shall include all registration fees, and travel and per diem expenses of the accrediting body representatives. The accrediting body shall accept all Government per diem rates for meals, hotels and travel reimbursement.</p>

Statement of Work


The items to be procured are as follows:
"	2 - Ultima XE Gas Monitors: XP E 00-U-1-S00000100
"	1 - Gasgard Series Gas Monitor: 1002991

Evaluation for the items will occur on a brand name or equal basis.  The Erie VAMC is currently using Ultima X and Gasgard Series Monitors.

1.	Alarm signal, response process, maintenance, operational techniques, and trouble shooting for the substituted item must be the same as that of the monitors listed above.
2.	The monitors must work/interface with the current Gasgard Series Gas Monitor System, which the Erie VAMC is already using.

One carbon monoxide monitor will be installed at the Boiler Plant Cat Walk.  The other carbon monoxide monitor and Gasgard Series monitor will be installed in the Building 7 Generator Room.  

Term of the contract -

<DESC>In Fiscal Year 2011, NASA plans to begin the Enabling Technology Development andDemonstrations	(ETDD) Program.  The primary goal of the ETDD Program is to develop anddemonstrate the technologies needed to reduce cost and expand the capability of futurespace exploration activities.  A secondary goal is to create opportunities for engineersand scientists from NASA, private industry, and academia to gain experience in designing,building, and operating new space technologies and spacecraft.	A third goal is todevelop technologies that can be relevant to non-exploration space activities and life onEarth.To support program formulation and acquisition planning activities, the ETDD Program isseeking ideas relevant to an initial set of demonstration projects to mature and testenabling technologies for future human exploration and robotic precursor missions to theMoon, Lagrange points, Near Earth Objects, and Mars and its moons. Each demonstration project is framed around answering a key question derived fromarchitectural studies. To demonstrate new capabilities that help address the keyquestions, technologies will be integrated into prototype systems and validated in arelevant environment.	Demonstration projects will have an expected project life cycleof two to four years.Demonstration projects will transition relevant technologies from lower to highertechnology readiness levels (TRLs).  They will take advantage of the full range ofavailable platforms, as appropriate to their need and specific objectives, including:ground-based test facilities and analogs, flight test aircraft, suborbital soundingrockets, commercial reusable suborbital vehicles, robotic spacecraft, the InternationalSpace Station, and other test platforms.The initial set of demonstration projects are in the areas of In-Situ ResourceUtilization (ISRU), In-Space Propulsion, Autonomous Precision Landing, Telerobotics, andFission Power Systems Technology.  Demonstration projects in other technical areas willbe formulated later as plans for exploration beyond low Earth orbit become more definite.NASA is inviting industry, academia, international, and other government andnon-government organizations to provide information.  Ideas are sought fordemonstrations, technologies, systems, and platforms that will help to address thefollowing five key questions and objectives: 1.	In-Situ Resource Utilization: Lunar Volatiles CharacterizationThis project will address the key question How can we locate, access, and extractvolatile resources on the Moon? The objective of the demonstration is to verify the presence of water and other volatileson the Moon by direct in-situ measurements of the lunar regolith.  The project will buildupon recent field tests of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technology bydemonstrating operation of a prototype ISRU system in a thermal vacuum chamber.  Then aflight experiment to demonstrate lunar resource prospecting, characterization, andextraction will be developed for testing on a robotic precursor mission around 2015.  The top-level requirements for this demonstration are:	Locate sub-surface areas of elevated hydrogen bearing compounds	Acquire sub-surface samples for analysis	Analyze soil samples for mineral composition, volatile content and bulk regolithcharacteristics.	Demonstrate the potential for volatiles and regolith utilization	Must be capable of flying on a variety of lunar lander precursor missions in apolar location.	Overall system mass must be less than 60kg and consume no more than 200W of peakpower. To enable this mission, information is sought on several key capabilities:	An instrument system that would be able to detect hydrogen with a concentrationof at least the minimum required water ice abundance (0.5 wt%) for ISRU contained in asurface layer of at least 5 cm thickness on top of otherwise dry regolith.  Additionally,the instrument should also be able to detect at least 1 wt% of water buried beneath 1meter of dry regolith.	The time required to measure abundance and approximate burialdepth shall be no more than 10 minutes at a given location.  Instrument system massshould not exceed 2.5 kg.	An instrument system that can quantify volatile gases released by sample heatingbelow atomic number 64 (of particular interest H2, He, He-3, CO, CO2, CH4, H2O, N2, O2,Ar, NH3, HCN, H2S, SO2). The instrument system must also be able to withstand exposure tothe release of HF, HCl, or Hg that may result from heating regolith samples to hightemperatures.  The instrument should be capable of detecting 1000 ppm to 100%concentration of the volatiles in the gas phase. The instrument should have a mass ofless than 5 kg not including any vacuum components required to operate in the laboratoryenvironment.	A thermal vacuum chamber will be required to test the experiment in simulatedlunar conditions. This chamber would not only need to approximate lunar temperatures andpressure, but it would also have to allow a bed of lunar regolith stimulant to be insidethe chamber so that a complete end-to-end test of the system could be conducted. Thechamber size desired is roughly 8 x 8 x 8.  Information is sought on chambers that mayalready exist or could be modified to meet this requirement. 2.	High-Power Electric Propulsion SystemThis project will address the key question How can we reduce travel time and cost forhuman deep-space exploration? The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility (TRL 6) of an electricpropulsion system that contains the combination of thrust, specific impulse, andefficiency required for human exploration architectures and a possible FlagshipDemonstration mission to begin as early as 2016.  The system should emphasize thrustertechnology and include power processing, a propellant feed system, and heat rejection.	Adigital control interface unit can be included as needed.  The proposed system must offeradvantages at a system level over state-of-the-art flight systems.The demonstration project must include integrated propulsion system functional testing ina representative environment.  The results of this testing will be used to determine thesuitability of the technology for a flight demonstration project, and system-levelperformance for use by mission planners.  A ground test in a thermally controlled vacuumchamber is an acceptable representative environment.The top-level requirements for this demonstration are:	Demonstrate a high power (&gt; 100 kW), high specific impulse, electricpropulsion system in an environment representative of space.  Individual thruster powerlevels should be 25 kWe or higher.	Electric propulsion system must be scalable to the power levels required forhuman exploration missions, providing the relevant combination of specific mass, specificimpulse, and efficiency.  Ranges for these parameters are:o	Several hundred kWe to several MWe power;o	&lt;10 to 70 kg/kWe specific mass, including the power system but excludingpropellant and propellant tankage;o	3,000 to 7,000 sec specific impulse;o	&gt;60 to 70+% efficiency.	Electric propulsion system lifetimes of 1 to 3 years of continuous operation	Leverage existing high-power, high-efficiency power generation systems 3.	Autonomous Precision LandingThis project will address the key question How can we land autonomously, precisely, andsafely on an extra-terrestrial surface in uncertain environments?The objective of the demonstration is to test an integrated autonomous landing and hazardavoidance system consisting of imaging sensors and navigation and control algorithms. NASA will initiate development of an Earth-based flight experiment to demonstrate anautonomous precision landing and hazard avoidance system on a small lander test bed. NASAwill pursue use of this system on a U. S. or international robotic precursor mission tothe Moon or other planetary body around 2014.  This technology will enable autonomouscargo landers, and reduce risk for future human exploration missions.The top-level requirements for this demonstration are:	Demonstrate autonomous landing of a robotic vehicle at any surface locationcertified as feasible for landing	Must be capable of identifying vehicle landing hazards in real-time, diverting toa selected safe landing aim point, and achieving a precise and controlled touch down atthe selected location.	Must be capable of landing in any lighting conditions	Must be capable of precise and controlled landing within several meters of alanding aim point selected from the hazard map generated on-the-fly during the approachphase without using external navigational aids.	Must be capable of flying on a variety of lunar lander precursor missionsTo enable this mission, information is sought on several key capabilities:Terrestrial Free Flyer Test BedA terrestrial free flyer test bed is desired with the following attributes:	Payload capability of at least 100 kg for a NASA sensor and electronics packagein addition to the mass required for the GN&C system and a power storage and distributionsystem capable of providing 500 W average power for 15 minutes.	Operational envelope of at least one kilometer in altitude with the capability oftranslating up to two kilometers laterally between the take off and landing locations.	Capability of approximating a range of lunar descent and landing trajectories.The reference trajectory is defined in terms of an approach phase with a flight pathangle of ~30 degrees, an initial slant range of one kilometer, and a maximum horizontalvelocity of 20 m/s followed by a vertical, or near vertical, terminal descent phasebeginning at an altitude of ~30 m to 50 m.	Minimum flight time of 210 seconds while carrying the maximum payload.Hazard Detection System	Components or sets of components with the following attributes are desired for areal-time hazard detection system (HDS) capable of mapping large contiguous areas ofplanetary terrain (10,000 m2 or greater) in five seconds or less at an operational slantrange of 1000 m or greater. Low mass and low power solutions are highly preferred.	 Key components of interest include:	Flash lidar sensor providing a data capture rate of ~2 Mpixels per second andcapable of reliably identifying surface roughness variations on the order of 30cm andlocal slopes exceeding five degrees	High-speed gimbal (internal or external to the flash lidar) providinghigh-precision point tracking and mosaicing (map generation) modes of operation for theflash lidar during the descent and landing trajectory	High output laser (~50 mJ) with a short pulse width (~6 ns to 8 ns) and uniformenergy distribution that is compatible with the flash lidar sensor in terms of repetitionrate (~30 Hz) and wavelength (near infrared, 1 to 2 microns)	Zoom optics (4x or greater) for the flash lidar enabling control over the sensorfield of view during descent	Fiber optics or other means for coupling the high output laser source with thetransmit or combined transmit/receive flash lidar optics located on the gimbal	High-efficiency, high-performance, general purpose processor system forgenerating and parsing the 3-D terrain data provided by the flash lidar sensor.  Theideal processor system would provide greater than 10 GFLOP effective computation rate,more than 1 GB of DDR memory, and greater than 1 Gb/s I/O.  Components proposed for theHDS must have a practical maturation path leading to spaceflight qualification.4.	Human Exploration TeleroboticsThis project will address the key question How do we use human-robotic partnerships toincrease productivity, reduce costs, and mitigate risks?The objective of the demonstration is to assess how telerobotics can improve theefficiency, productivity, and scientific return of human exploration. Remotely operatedand autonomous robots can perform a variety of tasks that are tedious, highly-repetitive,or long-duration. Robots can work before, during, and after human missions to increasethe effectiveness and capability of crew. The central challenge is to understand howhuman and telerobot activities can be coordinated to maximize mission success, whileminimizing risk. In 2011, this project will initially demonstrate teleoperation of a robot on the groundby crew on the International Space Station (ISS). In 2012, this project will demonstratehuman teams operating and working with multiple robots both on the ground (orbit toground) and on the ISS (ground to orbit). The demonstration will simulate humans atNear Earth Objects or in Mars orbit controlling robot teams on the surface to explore andprepare for the crew landing.The top-level requirements for this demonstration are:	Remotely operate robots to perform human exploration tasks:(a)	surface robots at high-fidelity analogue sites controlled from space;(b)	robots onboard space vehicles controlled from ground	Quantify benefits and limitations of humans in orbit controlling robots on thesurface, and vice versa (must consider data network bandwidth, communications latency,control modes, concept of operations, autonomy level, etc.)	Demonstrate heterogeneous robots collaborating with human teams (various teamconfigurations including Earth-based ground control)	Implement large-scale participatory exploration (real-time public involvementand/or citizen science in telerobotic missions)	Evaluate human-robot productivity, workload, performance, and human safety	Mature dexterous and human safe robotic technologies in 0g, radiation, EMI andother space environmental conditions.	Conduct high-fidelity experiments involving ISS (requires well-definedhypotheses, protocols, and metrics)	Develop approach for maturing and infusing prototype systems into flight missions(as demonstrations and/or experiments)5.	Fission Power Systems TechnologyThis project will address the key question How do we provide abundant, low-cost, andreliable electric power for long-duration missions?The objective is to perform a system-level test of an integrated (~1/4 power) nuclearpower unit to establish the technology readiness of power conversion and thermalmanagement technologies for a 40 kWe-class fission power system.  The power unit mustconsist of a non-nuclear heat source that simulates a small reactor, power converters, acoolant loop, and a high-temperature deployable radiator.  The test will validate theperformance of the integrated system in a thermal vacuum chamber and be completed in2014.  This technology could then be demonstrated in space as part of an advancedelectric propulsion system around 2016, or later as part of a robotic planetary surfacemission.  This project involves a partnership with the Department of Energy.The top-level requirements for this demonstration are:	Perform an end-to-end, system-level test using full size components in anoperationally relevant environment of a 40 kWe-class fission power system with thefollowing characteristics:(a)	Must ultimately be capable of operating on Mars, the Moon, or in deep space.(b)	Continuous power independent of location(c)	Low sensitivity to environment characteristics (e.g., temperature, dust, etc.)(d)	Operational simplicity (self-regulating without human control for weeks)(e)	Safe during all mission phases(f)	Long life (~8 years or more) with no maintenance	Validate the results of the technology demonstration against model predictionsfor a conceptual power system with the above characteristics	To maintain affordability of the technology demonstration, an electrically-heatedreactor simulator that has been validated with Department of Energy models based onhistorical reactor data should be used.PURPOSE OF RFIThe information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategydevelopment.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-3, the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to University of Massachusetts, Amherst of Amherst, MA, to estimate the cost of injuries occurring during Basic Combat Training (BCT) to the U.S. Army and to further understand the factors associated with increased risk for BCT-related injury and high costs.<BR><BR>The Army has identified reduction of musculoskeletal injuries as a priority for current and future research efforts. Under the Army Technical Objective (ATO), Prediction and Reduction of Musculoskeletal Injuries in Training and Operational Environments, and the additional ATO Interventions to Enhance Warfighter Psychological Resilience the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) Injury Epidemiology Research Section has developed a comprehensive research program to accurately and extensively study BCT Injuries in the U.S. Army. The research program will use the Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database (TAIHOD), which is a high resolution epidemiologic research data repository that offers significant potential for identifying risk factors, adverse health outcomes, and evaluating intervention strategies, among deployed and non-deployed active-duty (AD) personnel.  Funding and support of this multi-year study was dependent upon the Primary Investigator, MAJ Hill, identifying scientific experts who will augment his epidemiologic and military expertise, particularly in the areas of health policy, injury prevention, economic evaluation studies, and biostatistics.  The identified scientists from UMASS and Environ have acquired a significant amount of knowledge concerning the intricacies of the TAIHOD database from successfully completing 5 previous scientific projects for the Army using TAIHOD data. These previous efforts resulted in multiple peer-reviewed manuscripts and Army Technical Reports.<BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail at jonathan.lehmann@us.army.mil no later than 25 May 2010, 12:00 pm EST.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (0051) is to extend the augmentation of solicitation DAAE20-02-R-0193 for the award pools established for full and open competition and small business concerns in Segments 1 thru 5.  The solicitation will be open for augmentation until further notice.  See amendment 0043 for terms and conditions along with requirements and instructions for submitting proposals.  This is being done in order to promote additional competition and to secure production capacity.  This solicitation, originally issued on 13 September 2002, is for the procurement of various Sets, Kits and Outfits and will expire on 30 January 2013.  It may also be referred to as the SKO solicitation.  The term Sets, Kits and Outfits collectively refers to a wide variety of tools and equipment used to support the Armys tactical and combat support weapon systems and its ordnance and combat missions.<BR>A contract under a particular segment will give the awardee the opportunity to compete for future requirements in that segment.  This amendment will not result in the award of a delivery order for any of the sample requirements.  We are soliciting proposals from both large and small businesses.  Delivery orders will be competed in accordance with the fair opportunity to compete provisions set forth in the original solicitation, DAAE20-02-R-0193.  The award of a contract is not a guarantee that an order will be placed against that contract.  The award only signifies that the awardee is eligible to compete for delivery orders pursuant to the fair opportunity to compete provisions.  We will use the contracts to fulfill SKO requirements unless otherwise exempted by law or regulation.  <BR>In order to promote competition, this requirement was divided into the following segments in the original solicitation:<BR>Segment 1  Mechanical Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations.<BR>Segment 2  Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations.<BR>Segment 3  Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools and equipment, or special purpose tools and equipment, used to perform specific mission not normally associated with mechanical or building trades.  These kits may be housed in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations.<BR>Segment 4  Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually, some of the components of a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations.<BR>Segment 5  Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually, some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its carrier by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These kits are go-to-war items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations.  <BR>Segments 1 thru 5 will be individually competed and awarded under this amendment.  The Army intends to augment, or add to, the award pools already established for each segment:  one under full and open competition and the other for small business concerns.  As stated in the original solicitation, the Government reserves the right to augment the award pools from time to time to promote additional competition or to secure production capacity concerns.  <BR>New offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments (Segments 1 thru 5).  Existing offerors in Segment 1 or 2 may submit previously accepted technical proposals for consideration to be included in Segments 1, 2 or 3.  Existing offerors in Segment 3 must submit a new technical proposal for consideration to be included in Segments 1 and 2.  ALL existing vendors must submit a new technical proposal for consideration to be included in Segments 4 and 5.  Submissions will be in accordance with Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors) of this amendment.  Each segment shall require new offerors to submit a technical and a past performance proposal based on the sample SKO requirement that was used to create the award pools under the original solicitation.  <BR>The sample for each of the segments is as follows:<BR><BR>Segment 1:  Small Arms Repairman Tool Kit<BR>Segment 2:  Engineer/Construction, Carpenters Tool Kit <BR>Segment 3:  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Tool Kit (EOD)<BR>Segment 4:  Set, Standard Automotive Tool (SATS)<BR>Segment 5:  Shop Equipment Welder (SEW)<BR><BR>The Descriptions for Purchase (DFP) are located on our open solicitation page as Attachments 001 (Segment 1), 003 (Segment 2), 005 (Segment 3), 008 (Segment 4) and 0012 (Segment 5).  <BR><BR>Offers will be evaluated in accordance with Section M (Evaluation Factors for Award) of this amendment.  Contract clauses applicable to resulting award pool contracts will be included in this amendment.  Contractors that are awarded contracts to get into the SKO segments are expected to respond to our Request for Proposals (RFPs) and bid on at least 25% of the items within the segment.   <BR><BR>Point of contact:<BR><BR>For all Segments is Michael Good, michael.v.good@us.army.mil, 309-782-4130<BR>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Specific Requirement for the Department of Veteran Affairs for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-00-NIB-0508 <br />Name: WetTask Wiping System- Bucket<br />Description: Wipers for Bleach, Disinfectants and Sanitizers; Dry Rolls, for Pre-moistened Wiping System, 6 Refills of 90 Sheets and 1 Bucket</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-00-NIB-0510 <br />Name: WetTask Wiping System- Canister<br />Description: Wipers for Bleach, Disinfectants and Sanitizers; Dry Rolls, for Pre-moistened Wiping System, 6 Refills of 35 Sheets and 1 Small Canister</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be Department of Veteran Affairs, National Acquisition Center, Hines, IL.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Department of Veteran Affairs and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to Department of Veteran Affairs for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to Department of Veteran Affairs.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 24, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Description(s):
<p>The National Institute Of Standards And Technology (NIST) Intends To Negotiate, On a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(1)(b) , with the Technische Universitat Wien, Vienna, AUT. on continuing services for the following:</p>
<p>Improvements to the NIST Database (SRD 100) for the simulation of electron spectra for surface analysis (SESSA),1) Development of a concept of changes required to allow a user to apply SESSA to nanostructured surfaces, and submission of a report describing the needed changes.</p>
<p>2) Incorporation of a database of non-dipolar asymmetry parameters for photoelectron emission into SESSA, modification of the software to permit retrieval and display of these data and for spectrum modeling, and delivery of a new version of SESSA with these changes (SESSA Version 1.3)</p>
<p>Prof. Werner's expertise is in the quantitative application of Auger-electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the two most commonly used techniques of surface analysis. He is also the designer and principal author of SESSA. SESSA contains extensive physical data that is needed for quantitative applications of AES and XPS. SESSA also has software for the simulation of AES and XPS spectra to allow users to design experiments and to obtain more quantitative information from their AES and XPS results through comparisons of simulated and measured spectra. It is determined that NIST negotiate only with Prof. Werner because of his expertise in AES and XPS and because of his familiarity with the design structure and software code of the SESSA database.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Physics Laboratory, Ionizing Radiation Division, intends to negotiate with Luna Innovations, LLC; Roanoke, VA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the ultrasonic tomographic system described below.
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong> <br />The NIST Ionizing Radiation Division requires an advanced ultrasonic tomographic system. The ultrasonic tomographic system offered by Luna Innovations, LLC, is a more advanced version of a prototype developed under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with NIST designed specifically for mapping submilliKelvin changes in temperature in water, as is required for doing standard reference dosimetry with a water calorimeter. No such remote-sensing instrument suitable for water calorimetry of radiotherapy beams is commercially available, and, as a consequence of that work, Luna patented the technology. Background research conducted involving work done with prototypes of this instrument found no other competing instruments or techniques suitable for measuring time-resolved, spatial distributions of such small changes in water temperature.</p>
<p>NIST intends to procure an instrument that can map radiation-induced temperature changes in water throughout a 10 cm x 10 cm x 2cm volume with few-mm spatial resolution, 10s of microKelvin sensitivity to temperature change and a refresh rate approaching 1 Hz. Below is a description of the product to be procured:</p>
<p>&bull; Quantitative ultrasound unit including base software</p>
<p>&bull; Custom Interface to 128 element ultrasonic array: includes circuit board interface multiplexer: <br />NI SCXI-1130 with terminal board amplifier: custom assembled for differential input.</p>
<p>&bull; Custom Software and Support.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334519. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Luna Innovations, LLC for this requirement. <br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before May 20, 2010 at 12 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 
A list of surveys to be completed under this action is located in the attached statement of work.  The surveyor must be a licensed land surveyor in the State of Minnesota. The Surveyor will provide a boundary survey of the easement area which meets the requirements of the attached statement of work.  All projects shall be completed within 45 calendar days after issuance of a task order (to include the required pre-survey meeting through the post-survey meeting and submission of final survey deliverables to the NRCS office) unless the order states otherwise.  


SELECTION CRITERIA: 
Firms which meet the requirements described are invited to submit one original and three (3) copies of the attached Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications (completing both Part I and II).  Firms who have recently completed a SF 330, and have confirmed with the NRCS office that it is still on file, need not resubmit an SF 330.  However, should an offeror want to update the form a new one can be submitted and it will replace the one on file.

All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in no order of importance and all are equally important. 

1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. 
The Surveyor must be a licensed registered land surveyor in the State of Minnesota. Evaluation will include the level of formal education, the number of years licensed, and involvement in professional activities/organizations.

2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required
Evaluation will be based on knowledge of local survey practices, records research, experience in conducting rural or conservation easement boundary surveys, and the approach used on previous surveys to solve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.

3. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required performance time.
Evaluation will be based on ability to accomplish multiple work orders to completion within performance time stipulated in the statement of work and the ability to add personnel and/or consultants to complete work on time.  Due to the nature of the easement programs surveying work tends to be seasonal and multiple delivery orders can be issued in a short period of time.  The resultant solicitation and contract will stipulate limitations for the vendors obligation to perform and the governments obligation (maximum quantity) to order requirements for a given area.  Vendors should especially focus on articulating how requirements up to the limit will be fulfilled in the required time, as well as plans for addressing quantities of surveys over the maximum limit.  Evidence must be convincing and well articulated. 

4. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry.
Evaluation will be based on the firms past experience with other government agencies and the private section in performing the requirements described; cost control, quality, and timeliness of performance under previous contracts. References with name and telephone numbers must be provided.

5. Location in the general geographic area and knowledge of the locality of the project area
Evaluation will be based upon the firms location to the geographic area for each of the award areas for which they wish to be considered and knowledge of the locality of the project.  For firms outside the general project area(s), provide a plan to provide service in a cost effective manner. Firms must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed for each area..

6.  Demonstrated experience with similar types of projects in the State of Minnesota within the last five (5) years.  
Evaluation will be based on the firms experience in having conducted similar legal boundary surveys in the State of Minnesota within the last five (5) years. 

Use Section H of Part I of the SF 330 to provide relevant information regarding the above six (6) factors, if not adequately addressed in another section of the SF 330.

For each of the eight (8) planned awards, firms will be ranked from most to least qualified.  A request for proposal will be requested from the most qualified firm for each planned award and negotiations will be conducted to arrive at a fair and reasonable fee rate schedule that will be used to price individual task orders.  If a mutually acceptable price cannot be negotiated, negotiations will be terminated and the process will be repeated with the next highest ranked firm, and so on, and so forth, with the next if acceptable pricing cannot be negotiated. 

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov. It is also required that all contractors be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration in ORCA, contact the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov. This is NOT a Request for Proposals but a Request for Qualifications.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the ProgramExecutive Officer Space Systems (PEO SS) and the Navy Communications SatelliteProgram Office (PMW 146), is seeking sources to provide Ultra-High Frequency(UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) services in support of the UnitedStates Department of Defense on either lease or purchase options basis forchannels.The scope of the contemplated effort is to provide unprotected narrowbandSATCOM services for mobile and fixed-site terminal users.  The UHF SATCOMservice shall be compatible with operational UHF SATCOM terminals and controluser segments.  The Governments preference is to avoid a multi-year (see FARPart 17) contracting approach or any cancellation liabilities if any leaseservices options are not exercised.  If the Government does not exercise theoption to lease or purchase UHF channels, the Government may exercise theoption and retains the right of approval/refusal for the SATCOM serviceprovider to lease the UHF capacity to approved Allied Countries or otherapproved customers.Please see the enclosure for additional information.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source modification under Contract No. 283-05-0135, with Walter R. McDonald and Associates, Inc., 2720 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 250, Sacramento, CA 95833.

The purpose of this contract modification is to:  (1) complete national evaluation data collection and close-out activities required for year 6 of 25 CMHI grantee communities funded in FY2005.  These communities will complete their sixth and final year of the CMHI program in FY2011, and it will be necessary to collect the final year of national evaluation data collection to be able to have complete data on all CMHI grantee communities for the Congressionally mandated Report to Congress; (2) complete national evaluation data collection activities required for year 5 of five (5) CMHI grantee communities funded in FY2006, according to the national evaluation data collection protocol currently in place for this cohort.  National evaluation data collected from these five (5) grantee communities will be incorporated into the annual congressionally mandated report to Congress; and, (3) coordinate the cross-site evaluation and close-out activities required for year 3 of eight (8) Circles of Care grantee communities funded in FY2006.  These communities will complete their final year of the Circles of Care program in FY2011, and will need direct evaluation technical assistance to be able to collect the final year of cross-site evaluation data.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) is responsible for overseeing the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services to Children and Their Families Grant Program, also known as the Childrens Mental Health Initiative (CMHI).  CMHI provides six (6)-year cooperative agreements to States, political subdivisions of States, American Indian tribes or tribal organizations, and territories, to develop, implement, and sustain systems of care that meet the needs of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and their families.  The Circles of Care (COC) program is the grant program for American Indian/Alaska Native tribes and tribal organizations.  

Congress mandates that a national cross-site evaluation to assess the effectiveness of systems of care be implemented by the grant program.  The national evaluation includes the collection of longitudinal data to measure outcomes for children and their families.

Demonstration of Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications:

SAMHSA continues to identify important areas of services and systems improvements that enhance and support the efforts of the CMHI, in large measure due to the comprehensive efforts of the national evaluation of the CMHI program.  The current evaluation contract, Walter R. McDonald and Associates (WRMA), has successfully conducted national evaluation activities for all communities funded in FY 2005 (25 grantees) and FY 2006 (5 grantees).  

The CMHI (system of care) tasks in this contract modification--conducting national evaluation activities according to a prescribed and OMB-approved longitudinal data collection protocol for 25 system of care communities entering their sixth and final year of federal grant funding, and five (5) system of care communities entering their fifth year of federal grant funding--are expansions of tasks already underway through the current contract.  Congress mandates that a national cross-site evaluation to assess the effectiveness of systems of care be implemented by the grant program.  An Annual Report to Congress is also mandated by Congress and must be submitted to Congress to document the performance of the program.  Effective and uninterrupted data collection throughout the life of grant funding is essential to the quality and accuracy of data collected through the national evaluation and reported within annual reports to Congress of program performance and effectiveness.  The Circles of Care tasks in this modification, focusing on completion of the third and final year of the three (3)-year, cross-site evaluation of the eight (8) Circles of Care communities funded in FY 2008, is also an expansion of tasks already underway through the current contract.  WRMA has conducted the cross-site evaluation activities for the first two (2) years of the three (3)-year cross-site evaluation.  Disruption in the collection of cross-site evaluation data may likely significantly impact the accuracy, timeliness and quality of the cross-site data that is collected to report performance and effectiveness data for the Circles of Care grantees funded in FY 2008. 

At this time, WRMA is the only contractor capable of providing the required services.  WRMA has a unique familiarity with the subject matter, has demonstrated the expert ability to perform the tasks that are expanded through this modification, and will not require any additional start-up period since they are already performing identical tasks.  The staff expertise available through this contractor will enable SAMHSA to start the project immediately, conduct it efficiently, and bring it to conclusion within the shortest possible timeframe.  An award to another contractor would likely result in lack of continuity, unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements, and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

The substantial time, effort, and unique relationships required to plan and conduct the evaluation of multiple complex national evaluation activities conducted throughout the CMHI program would not be feasible or possible if a source other than WRMA were to attempt to perform this project.  As a result, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant learning period and/or organizational investment, resulting in unacceptable delays and excessive costs in fulfilling the agencys requirements.

This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1))Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capabilities received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  BW&T/Alabama Coosa Project, Tuscaloosa<br><br>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  This modification will increase the cost of a previous modification to de-water, clean, inspect, repair, and paint spillway gates at Bankhead Dam.  The additional cost is a result of additional rental equipment needed and a greater amount of repairs needed than originally expected for hydraulic equipment, cables, and cathodic protection.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and the previous mod and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, hydraulic systems, buildings, locks, and dams.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already performing the work under a previous modification.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  The amount and type of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on management of water levels and flows.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

The current procurement effort is a software change that is required to meet Department of Defense (DoD) password-length requirements. As this COTS product was selected for the DoD, and the COTS product is produced by Benson Medical Instruments, Inc., the DoD will need to contract with Benson Medical Instruments, Inc. to provide this update.<BR>Any firm that believes it can provide the services required is invited to submit a written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication of this notice.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command intends to procure on a sole source basis with Safe Boats International (SBI), 8800 SW Barney White RD, Port Orchard, WA 98367-7491, in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) 1 and FAR 6.302-1, twelve twenty-five foot full cabin Defender Class craft and will include a possible spare parts packages and training services. The method of procurement will be via Safe Boats General Services Administration contract schedule. The current requirement is to have a craft that is matched specifically to craft employed by maritime security forces in Yemen, Kenya, Bangladesh, Maldives, Republic of Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The key system attributes for this craft are the following:<br />1. Full cabin<br />2. Twin outboard engines<br />3. Commercial Radar<br />4. Full-sized foam collar system for flotation, stability and fendering in accordance with US Patent Numbers: 5,282,436, 5,647,297, 5,870,965, 6,810,827, 5,870,965, 5,647,297, 5,282,436, 7,070,730 and 7,201,865. <br />5. 8 foot 6 inch to 10 foot beam. <br />6. 10 person capacity. <br />7. Integrated fuel tank with fill and vent. <br />8. 4-12 volt power receptacles. <br />9. An aluminum trailer with salt water marine grade axles, brakes, and bearings. <br />The key performance parameters are the following:<br />1. 30 knot cruise speed in a full load condition in 3 ft 1/3 significant wave height seas. <br />2. Range of at least 100nm at cruise speed. <br />3. A maximum draft at 3 1/3 feet. <br />Additionally there are other considerations for this sole source award to Safe Boats International:<br />1. Safe Boats International has exclusive data rights to manufacturing processes and patents of the craft specifically matched to that used by the maritime security forces in Yemen, Kenya, Bangladesh, Maldives, Republic of Philippines, and Sri Lanka; therefore, it is not feasible to award to another contractor. <br />2. This craft will be used for training US Special Operations Forces (SOF) on the craft handling characteristics, craft maintenance procedures, etc that are used in the nations of Yemen, Kenya, Bangladesh, Maldives, Republic of Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Procurement of a craft that is not specifically matched would not train the US SOF community on the handling characteristics and provide no insight of the maintenance of the craft and therefore is not feasible in terms of logistical and training costs and training efficiency.
<p>Any vendor that provides written responses to this announcement must provide detailed proof that its craft is utilized by the maritime security forces in Yemen, Kenya, Bangladesh, Maldives, Republic of Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and has craft characteristics specifically matched to the Key System Attributes and Key Performance Parameters. The Government will not accept craft that have never been produced or are currently in design.</p>

<p>The Government will award a contract, pending availability of funds, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. We are using the lowest price technically acceptable method of source selection. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability and Price, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(1) All proposals timely received will be evaluated and an award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance between 6 and 12 months from Notice to Proceed.<br />b. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />c.

Submittal of a valid Bondability Letter from a Department of Treasury approved Bonding Agency covering the total offered price.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, who are expert in their respective disciplines, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 11.105, this brand name determination has been prepared to document the facts and rationale to support the determination that only one brand is available to provide the agency's requirement.  The supporting data has been prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation technical personnel.

2.  Identify the proposed contractor (with address) and describe why they are the only source capable of providing the supply/service:  N/A Brand Name Justification
3.  Estimated cost:  
4.  Additional facts that support the sole source vendor:  N/A
5.  Describe all market research that led to the decision that there is only one source:  Brand Name Justification The Tape Library is required for operation with a new Backup Server recently set up in Sacramento. A low cost Library with 2 fibre channel (FC) attached LTO4Linear Tape Open v4), tape drives are required. The fibre channel interfaced is required to be compatible with the host bus adapter (HBA) in the new backup server. The device must be able to be expandable to at least 5 drives and 75-80 tape positions to handle future backup expansion of increasing Sacramento client data volume. An additional FC attached LTO4 tape drive is required to be installed in the Denver Quantum i500 tape library. 2 SDLT tape drives are required each in Denver and in Sacramento to read legacy DO backup tapes.  It is the best value for the government to work within the existing framework than to purchase an entirely new system.

We seek a specific approach that takes into account experiences from both the public and private sectors. The training we seek is greater than simply process improvement or standard customer service strategies. We require the best of many concepts rolled into a novel approach that can be executed and implemented in a service organization.<br /><br />The training for this requirement is preferred between the dates of June 16, 2010 through June 18, 2010.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR Subpart 12.207, one firm fixed price award will be made for these commercial services.&nbsp; Offerors will be evaluated on their technical capabilities and price.&nbsp; As the difference in offerors' technical capabilities become more equal, price will be the determining factor in the award decision.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by ED.&nbsp; Offerors must adhere to the provision of FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items.&nbsp; Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with the quotation.&nbsp; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.&nbsp;In addition, FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Fund Transfer-Central Contractor Registration applies.</p>

<DESC><p>The goal of the Risk and Fraud Initiative is to identify and correct deficiencies in FHA's systems, processes, and programs that create unnecessary risks to the stability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund. These systems, processes, and programs are complex, given the counter-cyclical mission of the FHA. The Risk and Fraud Initiative will have different characteristics across FHA's major offices (Single Family, Multifamily, and Health Care). The immediate requirements will address the Office of Single Family Housing (OSFH). OSFH has adopted the guiding principle that it's Risk and Fraud mitigation efforts must first focus on developing improved detection capabilities which will allow for analysis and detection at the loan, product, portfolio and lender level.</p>

THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-40)

1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)
 
  Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. They must be received no later than seven calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Raman Triple-Spectrometer and Microscope. ***

Background:  

The Nanofabrication and Energy Research Group of NISTs Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology seeks to advance measurement science for the determination of materials properties at the micro- and nanoscale. The requested instrument is required as part of a nanofluids and nanomaterials facility for high spectral resolution, micro- and nanoscale thermometry and materials characterization measurements. 

The research need is for a low-drift, vibrationally stable, high-throughput, long focal length Raman spectrometer/microscope to be used predominantly for in situ thermometry in the spectral range from deep ultraviolet to visible wavelengths. The spectrometer must be capable of operating as a stand-alone microscope, via integration with an existing atomic force microscope (AFM), and using fiber optic coupling for remote sensing.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: One (1) Raman Triple-Spectrometer and Microscope, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

1)	The triple-spectrometer shall consist of three mirror-based spectrometers capable of operating separately in single spectrometer mode, basic subtractive mode, and triple additive (high dispersion) mode. 

2)	Each spectrometer shall have a focal length of no less than 600 mm. The total focal length of the system in triple additive mode shall therefore be greater than or equal to 1.8 m.

3)	The triple-spectrometer enclosure shall consist of a single-casting metal body (as opposed to bolting together individual spectrometers). The filter stage part of the triple-spectrometer shall integrate the grating drive into a single drive arm.

4)	The spectrometers shall consist of entirely mirror-based optics suitable for laser lines ranging from the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to the near infrared (NIR) regions.

5)	Shall have reproducible grating movement such that the positioning precision is within &#61617; 1 CCD pixel at any wavelength in subtractive mode.

6)	The triple-spectrometer shall be capable of introducing an attenuated gas calibration line (e.g., a Hg line, accompanied by appropriate filters and/or ports) into the spectra in all three operation modes listed in Specification 1 and for any sample setup (e.g., Raman microscope, AFM-integrated, remote sensing).

7)	The triple-spectrometer shall include a frequency-doubled 6 W argon ion laser that produces single laser lines at or close to each of the following wavelengths (/minimum nominal laser powers) spanning the DUV and visible spectrum: 244 nm(/100 mW), 364 nm(/140 mW), 458 nm(/200 mW), 488 nm(/1.5 W), 514 nm(/2 W); shall include appropriate water chiller for the laser.

8)	Shall include gratings suitable for each of the laser lines in Specification 7, achieving the highest possible spectral resolution for each line. The spectral resolution shall be < 1 cm 1/pixel for the corresponding laser line.  The total number of gratings or objectives is determined by the number of lines and the operation range for each grating or objective. The vendor must supply dispersion vs. wavelength data for the spectrograph mode (focal length)/grating combination.

9)	Shall include a high resolution (2048 pixel x 512 pixel or greater), single-chip, CCD detector appropriate for detection in the DUV to visible range.  The detector shall be free of etaloning artifacts.  The vendor must supply noise specifications (dark noise, readout noise) and collection efficiency vs. wavelength curves for each detector.

10)	The triple-spectrometer/microscope shall achieve diffraction-limited spot sizes for all laser lines listed in Specification 7.  A minimum NA of 0.25 is required for each objective.  The range of magnification shall cover 10x down to 40x in the DUV/UV; range of magnification shall cover 10x down to 100x in the visible. 

11)	Shall include the highest possible NA microscope objectives suitable for each of the laser lines listed in Specification 7. 

12)	Shall be capable of mapping spectra point-by-point over a spatial range of 10 mm to 100 mm in both x and y directions (i.e., along the axes defining the nominal sample surface plane) with a step size of approximately 100 nm.

13)	Shall be capable of two-dimensional imaging of a sample by scanning the laser on the sample (e.g., using a piezo- or Galvos-actuated mirror) and, separately, by sample scanning (moving the sample in x and y directions).

14)	Shall have confocal (micro-Raman) capability, using a physical aperture. 

15)	The triple-spectrometer shall include a fiber optic port suitable for performing remote sensing in the visible and NIR wavelengths.

16)	The spectrometer optics shall be compatible with integration into an existing atomic force microscope (AFM), i.e., supply a collimated beam (whether DUV, visible, or NIR) on an exit port. The collimated beam at the exit port shall be a particular diameter, approximately 12 mm. The exit port shall be at a particular height (approximately 400 mm) and at a location up to 500 mm from the spectrometer. The beam shall be shielded on the path to the exit port.

The contractor is not expected to provide/perform mechanical or optical integration beyond this exit port. The exact dimensions and location of the exit port and wavelength-dependent collimated beam diameter will be determined in conjunction with the AFM manufacturer after this solicitation is complete and before installation of the instrument at NIST.

17)	The control software/electronics shall be capable of communicating with an external device (1) that would provide triggers to the spectrometer for initiating spectral sweeps and user-programmed scripts and (2) to which the spectrometer would provide a signal at the conclusion of each spectral sweep (as in a point-by-point map performed in coordination with an AFM topographic scan). This trigger is preferably in the form of a TTL pulse, but alternatively may be in the form of an Ethernet communication protocol or RS232 communication protocol with an open SDK to be provided by Contractor.

18)	The software shall come with upgrades for a period of at least 5 years at no additional charge to the Government. 

19)	The triple-spectrometer/microscope shall come with a computer that meets the minimum requirements for operating all of the features of the triple-spectrometer/microscope. 

20)	The computer operating system shall be Microsoft Windows XP. The computer shall accept updates and upgrades installed via a server.  

21)	Shall include quantitative data analysis software using the most common data analysis algorithms. 

22)	The software shall be fully integrated and capable of controlling the functions of the spectrometers, microscope, lasers, and detectors.

23)	Shall be user-programmable for writing scripts that automate custom spectral sweeps, data collection routines, data processing, and communication with external devices (as defined in Specification 17).

Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements.  

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

 Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness, in accordance with 52.217-5.  Price will be evaluated based on the cumulative total of all the line item prices.

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY-Development of rhIL-15 (E. coli) cGMP Lyophilized Clinical Product 
<SOLNBR>ST10-1068
<RESPDATE>060410
<CONTACT>Howard R. Souder, Jr., Phone 3018465096, Email souderhr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY<br /><br />Title:&nbsp; Development of rhIL-15 (E. coli) cGMP Lyophilized Clinical Product
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>IL-15 is a 14 - 15 kDa member of the 4 &#61537;-helix bundle family of cytokines. It shares a number of biological activities with IL-2, including stimulation of the proliferation of activated CD4+, CD8+ and gamma-delta subsets of T cells. Recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) expressed in E. coli was manufactured by the BDP under cGMP to yield active rhIL-15 for cancer therapy adjuvant vaccines in human clinical trials. The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements for the development of a cGMP lyophilized product for future clinical studies.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>A previous study (data to be provided to the selected Subcontractor) demonstrated that rhIL-15 formulated in a Citrate, Mannitol, Sucrose, Tween-80 buffer was stable and retained its potency following lyophilization. Preliminary assessment of lyophilization parameters resulted in a uniform cake formation with minimal cracks. An ideal moisture value of &lt; 1% was not attained and additional cycle development studies are needed before GMP activities are initiated.</p>
<p>Project Management Plan</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will be required to submit a Project Management Plan (PMP) describing the means of accomplishing the Project Tasks. The PMP will include milestones to meet the Project Deliverables. Milestones will include but are not limited to 1) completion of the R&amp;D lyo studies and 2) completion of cGMP production. <br /><br />Risk Management Plan</p>
<p>The PMP will include a risk management plan (RMP) to identify potential technical problems that might arise during the course of work. The Subcontractor shall suggest solutions or alternative back up plans to address these potential problems.</p>
<p>Reports and Meetings</p>
<p>1. Project meetings will occur bi-weekly or as required by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (SAIC-F COTR).<br />2. Subcontractor will submit monthly technical and financial status reports to the SAIC-F COTR and SAIC-F Subcontract<br />Specialist.<br />3. Reports will include lyophilization cycle profiles, technology transfer report, certificates of analysis and a manufacturing report for the GMP process that will support clinical use of the resulting GMP materials.</p>
<p>Project Tasks:</p>
<p>1. Develop a lyophilization cycle based on the formulation previously evaluated by SAIC-F using the vendor's equipment that is translatable to cGMP production of 4000 vials with a fill concentration of 50ug rhIL-15/vial.<br />2. Recombinant human IL-15 will be formulated into the Citrate, Mannitol, Sucrose, Tween-80 buffer and provided to the vendor for Lyophilization-cycle development at a small scale of 10 - 20 mg; with an expected net yield of 200 - 400 vials 50ug/vial reconstituted to 1 ml). The components for container/closure are listed in Appendix A of this document.<br />3. The lyophilized vials will be evaluated for:<br />a. Reconstitution time<br />b. Acceptable cake appearance<br />c. Osmolality and visual appearance upon reconstitution to be free of particulates<br />4. Upon satisfactory completion of Task 3, samples will be provided to SAIC-F for analysis by (i) Potency, (ii) RP-HPLC, (iii) HPLC-SEC/LS, (iv) Protein Assay (Coomassie), (v) Moisture Content (Karl Fischer), (vi) Opalescence, (vii) Sterility, (viii) Endotoxin content.<br />5. Task 2 will be repeated with 200 mg rhIL-15 lyophilized to reproduce the small scale study results with an expected net yield of 4000 vials at 50ug/vial.<br />6. Criteria for deliverables shall include a lyophilization cycle of rhIL-15 that results in maintenance of the characteristics of the original dosage form upon reconstitution, including <br />a. Solution properties showing no particulates upon reconstitution<br />b. Stability/potency of IL-15 as shown by BDP analyses,<br />c. Structure or conformation of rhIL-15 as defined by item 4 above and<br />d. Particle-size distribution of suspension, with an overall residual moisture content of &le; 1%.<br />7. Preparation of cGMP batch production documentation. <br />8. Receipt and controlled storage of cGMP bulk rhIL-15 from the BDP.<br />9. Completion of aseptic vialing and lyophilization for rhIL-15 to net at least 4000 vials at 50 ug/vial.<br />10. Completion of all required CMC documentation of the lyophilized clinical product to enable an IND filing. This shall include regulatory documentation to cross-reference or submit the necessary Subcontractor facility, operation and quality system information for an initial IND filing.</p>
<p>Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>Criteria for deliverables shall consist of a lyophilization cycle of rhIL-15 that results in maintenance of the characteristics of the original dosage form upon reconstitution, including but not limited to: <br />a. Solution properties showing no particulates upon reconstitution<br />b. Stability/potency of IL-15 as shown by BDP analysis,<br />c. Structure or conformation of rhIL-15 and<br />d. Particle-size distribution of suspension, with an overall residual moisture content of &le; 1%.<br />Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other deliverables will be approved by the SAIC-F COTR.<br />All cGMP deliverables are also subject to the final review of documentation and release by the SAIC-F Quality Assurance department.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months from the date of award of the Subcontract.</p>
<p>Other Requirements</p>
<p>1. Facility audit for technical capability and cGMP compliance must be completed and found to be satisfactory to the SAIC-F Quality Assurance team prior to a Subcontract being awarded by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-10-Q-8041) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The small business standard is 1000 employees.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40 (Effective 22 APR 2010).
DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order.  Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide Naval Security Boat refurbishment for two (2) 25' BOOMIN' BEAVER TUG BOATS (BB-2 and BB-5); CLIN 0002: refurbish two (2) 36' ALUMINUM MOOSE BOATS (PROWLER I AND PROWLER II); CLIN 0003: refurbish two (2) 28' ALUMINUM DAUNTLESS SEAARK BOATS (BP-313 AND BP-316); CLIN 0004: refurbish two (2) 27' ALUMINUM DAUNTLESS SEAARK BOATS (PATROL 3 AND PATROL 5); CLIN 0005: refurbish one (1) 24' ALUMINUM MONARK BOAT (SCI-2); and CLIN 0006: refurbish one (1) 5.4 METER FIBERGLASS WILLARD RHIB (SCI-3). Period of performance: 05/27/2010 through 11/16/2010.  Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work.  PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.  
Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.  52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0006. The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism of the proposed price.  A contract price is realistic if it is high enough to preclude the contractor from enduring a significant financial loss in performing the requirements of the contract.  Unrealistically low prices increase performance risk to the Government.  The risk to the Government is that the contractor-to cut its losses-might: cut corners on product quality; deliver late; default, forcing a time-consuming reprocurement; or refuse to deal with the Government in the future or be forced out of business entirely.  The Government will base its evaluation of price realism on a comparison of a quoter's proposed price to other proposed prices received in response to this solicitation and the independent Government estimate.  Prices will be rated either realistic or unrealistically low.
Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a quoter has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Quoter's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the quoter's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not consider the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide information about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.  Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make a quoter ineligible for award.  The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3.  More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.  Quoters who've completed ORCA should notify the contract specialist before solicitation's closing date and time so it can be downloaded by the procuring contracting office.  The full text of FAR and DFAR provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/index.htm, respectively.

Brand Name Justification:  Juniper Replacement Devices
Norfolk Naval Shipyard has a requirement to replace existing Juniper Secure Services Gateway (SSG) devices which are reaching end of life (EOL).  This equipment supports remote connectivity between the shipyards and extensions of the legacy network which supports the shipyard mission at diverse locations.
Without the replacement devices, connections to the other shipyards would be taken offline.  Remote extensions of the legacy network would be removed as there would be no way to securely communicate with the sites and shipyards.  For continued operations, Juniper SSG devices must be purchased to replace the existing devices that are reaching EOL.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting proposals for an initial purchase of 25 CF-19 Toughbook computers. In addition, we are soliciting for a further 130 computers in case funding becomes available in the future. This project is part of the broader Battlefield Airmen program, currently addressing requirements for combat control/special tactics and pararescue. This combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items was prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation FA8629-10-R-2477 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) using the streamlined procedures for evaluation of commercial items as outlined in FAR 12.6. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. The acquisition will be processed as a full and open competition. The associated NAICS code is 334111.&nbsp; <strong>THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 21 MAY 2010.</strong>
<p>2. Respondents to this Request for Proposal (RFP) should submit a fact sheet and a bid for a CF-19 Toughbook with the attributes listed on under CLIN 0001 of the model contract. Each system shall include the standard warranty available for the CF-19. Please state what is included in the standard warranty. In addition, please state if higher level warranties are available, what they entail, and the costs associated with those warranties. In the event that this office determines to purchase a higher level warranty, that warranty will be included as a separate CLIN in the contract. The place of delivery for the initial 25 Toughbooks is listed in the model contract attached hereto, and the contractor shall propose a delivery date for the 25 computers. .<strong>THE PART NUMBER FOR THIS ITEM HAS CHANGED.&nbsp; PLEASE SEE THE UPDATED MODEL CONTRACT FOR THE NEW PART NUMBER.</strong></p>
<p>3. In addition, we are also soliciting a quote for an additional optional buy of up to 130 CF-19 Toughbooks. These may be purchased as funding becomes available. Therefore, all offerors shall propose any quantity discount(s) available, and what the minimum order is to receive any quantity discount. This additional purchase will be placed as an option in the ensuing contract. The contractor shall propose a delivery schedule (in days/weeks after award format) for the optional Toughbooks.</p>
<p>4. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. As indicated on the attached Standard Form 1449, award will be made on the basis of a simplified trade-off. In this instance, technical selection criteria will be of greater importance than cost. The Government will also evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s) and general statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well-known techniques will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP specification in whole or in part will not constitute compliance with this requirement concerning the content of the technical requirement. Offerors shall complete and submit with each proposal FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.</p>

Paper copies must be clearly labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" on the cover sheets and in close proximity to this type of information, on each applicable page. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information will be protected from disclosure. E-mail copies of the paper submittal will be accepted.</p>

<p>TASK 4. The Contractor must be aware that the audience is comprised of some very seasoned managers as well as less seasoned managers, and aspiring leaders. In addressing the curriculum, the Contractor must ensure that all participants understand the information being conveyed, without making the training laborious for those who may know much more.</p>
<p>IV. DELIVERABLES: SEE ATTACHMENT B</p>
<p><br />V. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT: The Government shall provide the following material and equipment to the Contractor for the training session:</p>
<p>1. The classroom facility at the Volpe Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA in which to present the course that will accommodate an audience of up to 35 participants.<br />2.

<p>VII. SCHEDULE: One 1 1/2 day training event will be presented before September 30, 2010 for up to 35 executives and managers. Four optional training sessions, two each in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Dates to be coordinated upon award. PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (END)</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CRITERIA: 1. TRAINING METHODOLOGY: The Offeror shall describe, in sufficient detail, the approach to be used in performing the tasks identified in the performance work statement (PWS) (no more than 5 pages). 2. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS: The Offeror's representative(s) will possess skills appropriate to conduct training for executives and managers on leadership skills related to employee engagement and empowerment, and must possess the following minimum education and experience: (resume of proposed trainer shall be no more than 3 pages): A Master's degree from an accredited college or university in organizational behavior, psychology, or similar field that has prepared the Contractor to apply and teach the leadership principles relevant to this course. A Doctorate degree is preferred. This level of educational achievement is equal to that of many of the attendees and will facilitate acceptance as an expert in the field. The instructor should possess a thorough theoretical knowledge of the topic through publications and/or experience. As a minimum, the instructor should possess 10 years of experience training executives and managers. 3. PAST PERFORMANCE: If the instructor has had verifiable experience presenting leadership training satisfactorily to Federal executives and/or managers, that experience may be used to determine best value to the Federal government. If the offeror has performed work in the past two years for the Volpe Center, that performance may be considered when determining the capability to perform the work. BASIS OF AWARD: <br />Award will be made to the Offeror who offers the best value to the Government in terms of technical criteria (proposed training methodology, staffing and past performance) and price. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: The technical evaluation factors in the Technical Proposal are of equal importance (training methodology, staffing requirements and past performance), and when combined, are significantly more important than cost in the selection of a contractor for award. Notwithstanding this fact, Offerors are cautioned not to minimize the importance of the Price Proposal. As the difference in technical ratings of submitted Technical Proposals decreases, the importance of price will increase. When the Technical Proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, price may become the determining factor in making an award. PLEASE NOTE: Reiteration of the Statement of Work requirements does not constitute an acceptable response and will be considered non-responsive.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Atlanta, GA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905 for services to access data of the Rochester Epidemiological Project (REP), which is an epidemiologic database containing comprehensive clinical records and to identify prevalent Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) cases from the REP database and assess patients for further evaluation in the Mayo Fatigue Clinic. This requirement will bring in a random sample of cases identified in the REP to the clinic .These persons will be assessed for current fatigue and metabolic syndrome status, current anxiety and depression will be evaluated and additional gynecologic/reproductive history will be collected. The REP database includes diagnostic codes for conditions identified by physicians at doctor's visits or hospital stays; a large proportion of patients have lifetime records included in the database. CFS occurs predominantly in middle age. We are interested in examining clinical events that occurred prior to the development of CFS, so it is important that we have access to a database that includes diagnostic information about childhood and adulthood clinical conditions. In addition to the database itself, REP can advise us on how to measure any clinical factors we are interested in examining as diagnostic factors, risk factors or causes of death using a combination of ICD codes and record abstraction. Using the REP to identify CFS cases and receiving patients to the Mayo Clinic for further examination allows us to look at CFS risk factors in a longitudinal design rather than cross-sectional.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition is to the Mayo Clinic under authority of 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.

<DESC>****Modification 2 to Presolicitation Notice ARRA-OS-PACES_Presolicitation****
<p>The purpose of this modification is to update the solicitation release date to the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anticipated release date of the solicitation has been updated to read on May 14, 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br />****Modification 1 to Presolicitation Notice ARRA-OS-PACES_Presolicitation****<br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to answer questions received in response to the presolicitation and update the solicitation release date:<br /><br />I. Questions and Answers:<br /><br />Question 1: Is this a small business set -aside?<br /><br />Answer 1: The presolicitation clearly states "FDA intends to solicit this requirement as&nbsp;&nbsp; "Full and Open Competition."<br /><br />Question 2: Please clarify, the Presolicitation states "The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees" and also states "FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a Full and Open competitive requirement."</p>
<p>Answer 2: As stated in Part D this is a Full and Open Competitive Requirement: SBA has established numerical definitions, or "size standards," for all for-profit industries. Size standards represent the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) may be to remain classified as a small business concern. Additional information on size standards can be found at http://www.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/index.html.<br /><br />II. Updates<br /><br />The anticipated release date of the solicitation has been updated to read&nbsp;on or around May 10, 2010.<br /><br /><br /><br />All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<br />_________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00065 (subject to change) for an initiative called "Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science" (PACES). PACES is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement will be funded by the Recovery Act.</p>
<p>A. Project Background</p>
<p>Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest. While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research. CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings. For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations.</p>
<p>As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals. The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed. The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient. <br />A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes. Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.</p>
<p>The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance. These data are an invaluable resource for CER. Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector. As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical.</p>
<p><br />B. Objective</p>
<p>The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with a contractor who has biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. The contractor will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets. As part of this effort, the contractor will conduct analyses on defined datasets including datasets previously developed as part the joint Janus initiative, where FDA's Center's specific questions will drive the data transformed, standardized and loaded into the Janus data warehouse. Additionally, the contractor will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops that address issues such as methods for cross-study and other comparative analyses, best practices in CER, and candidate studies and their design and analysis methods. These strategies will also encompass clinical trial designs that can help advance personalized medicine and health outcomes both within and outside of the FDA.</p>
<p>C. Scope:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct CER. This work effort shall include four principle components as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Component 1- The Contractor shall plan and organize the CER project with FDA stakeholders, including participation in annual FDA-hosted planning workshops (three workshops, two days each) to define candidate CER questions and priorities, analyses strategies and datasets to be utilized. <br />&bull; Component 2- The Contractor shall provide training on methodologies developed to FDA staff during two of the FDA-hosted planning workshops. <br />&bull; Component 3 - The Contractor shall identify or develop appropriate analytic methodologies for CER and apply them to FDA and/or other data; develop new scientific computing strategies and hone existing computational strategies to perform these CER analyses. The Contractor shall prepare reports and manuscripts of the results suitable for publication in scientific journals. <br />&bull; Component 4- The Contractor shall develop innovative clinical trial design strategies for prospective CER clinical trials and analyses of healthcare data including providing formal recommendations for best practices for submission of studies to the FDA when they involve product comparisons. These strategies and recommendations shall be documented in reports and manuscripts suitable for publication in scientific journals.</p>
<p>D. Additional Information</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) or more contracts will be awarded with a three (3) year base period from&nbsp;August 01, 2010 to&nbsp;July 31, 2013 with two (2) one (1) year options. FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a Full and Open competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation will be an upload to this pre-solicitation notice. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ENTERTAINED. Please send questions or comments in writing to Dominique.Malone@fda.hhs.gov. It is up to interested parties to check this site for the release of the solicitation as it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.

<DESC><br />JUSTIFICATION
<p>There are at least 2 companies manufacturing marine pop-up satellite tags. Wildlife Computers Inc., in Redmond, WA, is the only company that can provide a tag that meets the above specifications. These specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of the same study; we have deployed 47 such tags thus far in our post-hooking mortality study for ESA-protected loggerhead sea turtles. Wildlife Computers is the only U.S. supplier that has popup satellite archival tags with operational protocols that ensure that even if the turtle they are put on dies, that scientists will get back the data transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system. These protocols include a mechanical failsafe system that releases the tag prior to the popup date if the turtle sinks past 1,500 m. Also, this tag (Brand name MK-10 PAT) has software that allows researchers to program the tag to release prior to its programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. They also can be programmed to transmit intermittently while still attached to the turtle to provide data critical to using known-fate mark-recapture analysis methods. These specifications were competed by&nbsp;the government&nbsp;twice in the past (most recently in 2006) and Wildlife Computers was the that&nbsp; met these specifications.</p>

The award date will be o/a July 30, 2010.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -3.6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The purpose of this procurement is to </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'">support Ethiopia's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), more specifically to support IRS in Oromia Regional State. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Approximately 75% of Ethiopia's landmass is endemic for malaria, with malaria primarily associated with altitude and rainfall. In general, the peak of malaria incidence follows the main rainfall season (July - September) each year. However, many areas in the south and west of the country have a rainfall season beginning earlier in April and May or have no clearly defined rainfall season. Depending on these rainfall patterns, transmission tends to be highly heterogenous geo-spatially within each year as well as between years. Additionally, malaria in Ethiopia is characterized by widespread epidemics occurring every 5-8 years, with the most recent one between 2003 and 2005. In 2007/2008, malaria was the first cause of outpatient visits, health facility admissions and in-patient deaths, accounting for 12% of out-patient visits and 9.9% of admissions. </span></p>

<DESC><p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, Maryland, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b), with Gamma Products, Inc. for a low level Automatic Alpha/Beta Counting System with the following features:<br />1. Dual wire gas flow sample detector with gas flow guard.<br />2. Multi-channel analysis for alpha and beta discrimination. <br />3. The modular nature of the Gamma Product unit's detector mounts makes it simple to replace detectors as needed, e.g., field replaceable by in-house personnel, as the unit requires minimal disassembly to replace detectors.<br />4. PC-based storage for sample data as well as DVD storage of sample data.<br />5. Automatic HV plateau generation, Chi-Square testing, and system diagnostics.<br />6. Sample carriers do not require the use of bar coded stickers.<br />7. No router and routing software is required between system components.<br />8. Expected lifetime of this unit under anticipated operating conditions is 20+ years.</p>
<p>This supply will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The sole source determination is based on Gamma Products offering detector modularity, storage of sample data, as well as automated systems diagnostics as outlined above, therefore it is determined to be the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government. This item utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3824 and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p>Gamma Products, Inc. Model G5020C is utilized by Health Physics personnel, reactor staff, and research staff to analyze samples for removable alpha and/or beta contamination resulting from work with alpha-emitting radionuclides, e.g., depleted uranium or transuranics (plutonium, americium, californium, neptunium), or radioactive contamination resulting from neutron activation of reactor components, protocol experimental elements, or reactor-produced byproduct material. This equipment forms the backbone of the radioactive contamination monitoring and control programs at the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI). Use of this equipment permits Health Physics to reduce potential exposure of personnel to radioactive contamination, thus complimenting our scientific support mission.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide a low level Automatic Alpha/Beta Counting System solution that includes all features as outlined above. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to carolyn.lisovich@usuhs.mil. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 17 May 2010, 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT ACTION<br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY UNDER THE OFFICE OF EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH ELECTRONIC RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION UNDER WYLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS LLC CONTRACT NUMBER HHSN-276-2009-00202U.<br />In accordance with FAR Part 5.7 Publicizing Requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, this is a notification of a modification to an existing, competitively awarded fixed price delivery order using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding. This contract is to provide the eRA community with proficient staff and consultants who possess a wide-range of experience in providing administrative and technical support to the eRA mission.<br />It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to modify purchase order number HHSN-276-2009-00202U with LTS Corporation (DUNS 068212398). Currently, the Vendor provides executive administrative, communications and outreach, data analysis, and project management support to the Office of Extramural Research (OER) Electronic Research Administration (eRA) to enhance user support functions at the NIH. As a result of ARRA funding, the NIH believes that the system improvements can be executed in a timely fashion allowing enhanced user support. The purpose of this modification is to provide support for the Federal Financial Reporting (FFR) Project that will modify the current Financial Status Report module in the Commons to collect all new information required by FFR. The modification will allow for the requirement that grant recipients periodically submit reports on their grant's financial progress.<br />The activities and labor categories are within the scope of the existing contract and do not constitute new work. The contractor shall provide resources in quantities and timelines in accordance with, and as notified by, the current ordering processes of the Project Officer to meet agency demands for surge support.<br />Labor Categories and Descriptions<br />Below are the labor categories and descriptions from the existing master contract that may be required under this task order:<br />Technical Information Specialist<br />Provides communications support for upcoming changes in process or policy, new enhancements and defect fixes in any of eRA's 24 software applications associated with the grant process, emergency issues, potential fixes and estimated time for resolution, system downtime and training and outreach requirements.<br />This notice is for information purposes only. This is not a RFQ nor is a RFQ available.<br />If you have any questions please contact Em'Ria J. Briscoe at briscoee@mail.nih.gov.<br />

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.</p>
<p>A Cost-Plus Fixed Fee, 2 year contract was awarded on May 4, 2010 by the Office on Disability in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) under funds from the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to Mathematica Policy Review, Inc. <br /><br />This project will establish a Center of Excellence in Research on Disability Services and Care Coordination and Integration. Its purpose is to build the foundation and infrastructure necessary to conduct CER on systems of care for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Center will be operated by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (DHHS and managed by Rosaly Correa-de-Araujo, MD, MSc, PhD, Deputy Director of the HHS Office on Disability, who also serves as the Contracting Officer Technical Representative and Scientific Lead/Advisor for the project. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will serve as a federal partner on this project.</p>
<p>The Center will be charged with building the infrastructure necessary to carry out research on the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of services provided to individuals with disabilities. Specifically, the Center will:</p>
<p>* Work with the CCW to document the public data available from CMS, identify and interpret data gaps, and support HHS agencies in making necessary data improvements to better reflect information on health and support services for people with disabilities to be used for CER studies.</p>
<p>* Expand the CCW created by CMS by linking existing sources to other data sets thereby increasing the ability to use CCW for research on people with disabilities including CER of health and support services for chronic care, including systems of care.</p>
<p>* Conduct thorough reviews of HHS and outside efforts in research and evaluation of the effectiveness and/or comparative effectiveness of health and support services for people with disabilities. This must include a systematic review of published and unpublished studies or data.</p>
<p>* Identify and compare the effectiveness of existing models of community-based care coordination and integration for people with disabilities. Determine best practices and to what extent support services, holistic approaches and health promotion interventions affect the health and well-being of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>* Assess Medicaid data reported by a small number of selected states (4 to 6) on both their state plan and waiver services to identify the types of benefits offered, information reported and data available, and use these findings to propose ways to standardize some or certain services and reporting, i.e. generate greater consistency on how services are used or defined. This will facilitate the development of future CER studies.</p>
<p>* Based on the assessment of Medicaid data from selected States as mentioned above, develop quality improvement pilot interventions that can be implemented by states to improve the quality of information reported and allow for comparative data analysis. This will facilitate the development of other future quality improvement strategies.</p>
<p>* Develop and coordinate a Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) taxonomy and/or a health care glossary relevant to providers, policymakers and people with disabilities. Consider the work of Thomson-Reuters and others in completing this task.</p>
<p>* Develop a blueprint for continued and future research and data capacity-building in support of CER, and the translation and dissemination of research findings to providers, policymakers, and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>* Develop and maintain a section of the Office on Disability's website to disseminate the Center's activities on CER.</p>
<p>* Develop a plan to continually evaluate the impact of various products and activities of the Center.</p>
<p>The main functions of the Center of Excellence in Research on Disability Services and Care Coordination and Integration will therefore be production, dissemination, implementation, evaluation, data collection and research. There are large areas of overlap between these functions, but the diverse needs of this contract require expertise in a wide range of areas including long-term care policy research and development including data collection and manipulation. Each of the inter-related functions is integral to the successful implementation of the contract.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This procurement was awarded using other than full and open competition because ASHRAE was determined to be the only responsible source and no other services would satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this is a follow-on contract, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This award is a continuation of the development and integration services supporting the TC-AIMS II commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) supply chain solutions developed by Apptricity.  The specialized vendor patent software developed by Apptricity is a major component of the Transportation Information System (TIS).  Apptricity's COTS software offers the ability to operate within any hardware/software configuration, regardless of operating system, data source, application server or web server.  Leveraging the clustering, pooling, and load balancing technologies, Apptricity's COTS software offers the ability to support several hundred to several thousand sim  ultaneous users and offers integrated configuration and customization capabilities to dynamically change the functionality of its solutions, including page configuration, reference data, workflow and process rules based on customer specific requirements.  Apptricity's COTS software also offers an Integration Engine to enable real-time and batch interfaces to internal and external systems. The Integration Engine accommodates object relational mapping and standard interfaces with XML, EDI, delimited and fixed format data.  Apptricity Corporation has supported the PEO TIS program for the past 5 years in its development of an Interface Engine which wraps legacy formats (CSV, XML, X12, fixed) with an XML layer to standardize interfaces.  Since November, 2004, Apptricity's proprietary software has become the baseline for continued TIS development and customization.  Maintaining continued support and operation for the system is critical to the overall DoD and Joint Services mission.

<OFFADD>Department of Veterans Affairs; West Palm Beach VA Medical Center;7305 North Military Trail; Palm Beach Gardens FL  33410-6400 <SUBJECT>J--Provide all necessary labor, equipment, materials, tools, supervision to install upgrades and repairs on Laundry's TransVac conveying system to include upgrades and repairs to the Trans-Vac Electronic Control Panel.
<DESC>Synopsis: The Department of Veterans Affairs West Palm Beach VA Medical (ASAO East 8) in West Palm Beach, Florida 33410, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with TransVac Systems LLC, for the replacement of defective parts and upgrade of the TransVac Electronic Control Panel System of the Facility Laundry's TransVac System. The Contractor shall provide all electronic parts, accessories, labor, materials and necessary equipment to complete the job as stated in the Statement of Work. The NAICS code is 238290 with a size standard of 14 million dollars. The period of performance for this procurement will be for 2 months from time of award. Justification for this sole source procurement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), only one responsible source.  It is believed that the Trans-VAC Electronic Panel and other parts needing repair or replacement presently installed will require Trans-Vac electronics parts and components of proprietary nature.  
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. It is not a solicitation or request for offers. No solicitation package is available. A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and services, to the Contracting Officer within seven calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. If no valid responses are received, the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center will proceed with the intended sole source contract named TransVac Systems LLC. The following additional clauses apply: CCR Clause: Attention: You must be registered in CCR to be considered for award. FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (O ct 2003) (B) (2) the offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, it's DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the contracting officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (C) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. Responses must be received no later than 2:00 P.M. ET on 5/7/2010. Inquiries can either be e-mailed to Contracting Officer Adalberto.Afanador@VA.gov . This is the only form of communications available about this acquisition.
