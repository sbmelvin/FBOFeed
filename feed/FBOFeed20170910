<DESC>The 115th Fighter Wing awarded a sole source firm-fixed price contract on a noncompetitive basis. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the 115 Fighter Wing (FW) has determined that this procurement of upgrade equipment and installation for the existing Advantor Intrusion Detection System / Video Management System meets the criteria established for other than full and open competition. The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). Advantor uses proprietary software and hardware to integrate all hardware to the system, and is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the current system. Any upgrades and/or enhancements must be accomplished by Advantor due to their proprietary nature of their system.<br />&nbsp;

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(1)  System Sensitivity/Penetration
This test should be done with the following settings:
maximum transmit power
proper receiver gain and TGC that allows echo texture to be visible in the deep region
transmit focus at the deepest depth
The maximum depth of visualization is determined by comparing the gradually weakening echo texture to electronic noises near the bottom of the image.

(2)  Image Uniformity
Adjust the TGC controls and other sensitivity controls to obtain an image as uniform as possible.
vertical or radially oriented streaks?
dropouts?
reduction of brightness near edges of the scan?
brightness transitions between focal zones?

(3)  Electrical and Mechanical Safety and Cleanliness
Are all cords and cables intact (no frays)?
Are all transducers intact without cracks or delamination?
Are the transducers cleaned after each use?
Are the image monitors clean?

Are the wheels fastened securely to the US unit and do the wheels rotate easily?
Are all accessories (VCR, cameras, etc.) fastened securely to the US unit?

(4)  Gray Scale Photography (if applicable)   Do either (a), (b), or (c).

(a)  For Scanners with a Discrete Bar Pattern
Count the number of distinct gray bar steps on the viewing monitor.  Then count the number of steps visualized in the gray bar on the hard copy image.

(b)  For Scanners with a Continuous Gray Bar Pattern
Use calipers to measure the length of the black-to-white transition of the gray wedge on the viewing monitor.  If the relative length of the black-to-white transition on the hard copy image is less, document how much is missing.

(c)  For Laser Imager (Hard Copy Device)
Prior to filming any images, an SMPTE test pattern created by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), should be printed using the appropriate window width (WW) and window level (WL).  If you are unfamiliar with this procedure, you should review Gray et al.,  Test pattern for video display and hard-copy camera,  Radiology 145:519-527 (1985), and then contact your local service engineer for assistance.  When printed, the 95% density patch within the 100% square and the 5% density patch within the 0% square should be visible, and there should be no notable distortions or artifacts present.  If these criteria are not met, contact your service engineer for laser camera calibration before proceeding with any filming.

(5)  Hard Copy Output Quality Test (Digital) (if applicable)
This test, or a similar test specifically recommended by the hard copy equipment manufacturer.
Required Test Equipment
Densitometer
SMPTE Test Pattern or another similar test pattern or phantom image having a wide range of gray scales.

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/pre-solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-NOI-17-695 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to Leica Microsystems Inc located at 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL 60061.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY &amp; STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95, dated January 19, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with size standard of 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, which indicates that only Leica Microsystems Inc is capable of providing the necessary support services. Specifically, Leica Microsystems Inc is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the instruments requiring service and the instruments are proprietary to this company. As such, only Leica Microsystems Inc is authorized to provide service and parts for this equipment. Use of any other contractor would place equipment integrity in jeopardy which would then risk continuity of science; should the equipment not remain fully operational to original equipment manufacturer standards, standardization of longitudinal research study data would be jeopardized and any loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) mission. Accordingly, only Leica Microsystems Inc is capable of providing the required support services.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>

belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended,
proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not
[X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public
(Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the
submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records,
making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks
“have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted
for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses
enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period
preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the
liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The
tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability,
the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent
in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due
and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the
taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and
the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS
Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the
lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the
taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent
because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy
protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the
Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more
contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an
officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a
business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a
False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title
18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time
prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous
by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Question: Evaluation Factor 4 (Qualifications of Proposed Personnel) contains many references to experience of personnel being specifically related to CCDF and/or CCDF Lead Agencies. Would HHS/ACF/OCC consider removing this language to ensure that proposed contractors' similar/related experience in other agencies is deemed equivalent to the experience the incumbent/partner with the incumbent may have had on the existing contract?<br />Answer: No; the Government will not remove this language. This foundational knowledge is essential to the successful performance of this requirement. Please reference Section C.1 "Scope and Requirements, General Requirements (g)" (page 9) and Section C.2 "Task 2 - Communications and Content Expertise.</p>
<p>The due date/time for the submission of proposals remains unchanged. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall be submitted by September 18, 2017 at 12:00 p.m. (ET).</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions of this solicitation remain unchanged by reason of Amendment 000002.</p>
