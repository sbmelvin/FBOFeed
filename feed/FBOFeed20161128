Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

The TRX Tactical Training locker (Heavy) is a fully deployable standard 8 ft (Tricon) ISO container custom fabricated to anchor a functional training rig and store equipment necessary to create a multi-modality training center for multiple users. This package enables units that have limited space or operate primarily in expeditionary environments to conduct multi-modality, functional training beyond the walls of a traditional fitness facility. The functional training rig consists of three independent fully functional squat racks and 7 chin up stations that easily attach to the outside of the container In 30-45 minutes. Each Independent rack is designed to support a separate domain of the proprietary lift-Move-Recover training system. The external framing is manufactured with 3 in x 3 in powder coated steel and equipped with adjustable leveling feet to provide stability on uneven terrain. Using the container's Internal E-Track,all of the fitness training equipment-and external racks store neatly and securely inside for transport in order to meet the needs of an operational unit on the move. When used with an LSA (Land, Sea, Air) Adapter device (sold separately), the container becomes fully deployable on military cargo aircraft with 108 in 4631 cargo systems (Cl30, Cl41, Cl7, C5 and 8747). The LSA Adapter eliminates the pallet requirements of shipping a Tricon container (pallet, chains and dunnage), thus making the container faster and more economical to transport.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is hereby seeking industry comments for the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for the MSFC and Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) Protective Services (MMPS) requirement. A Sources Sought Notice for this requirement was previously posted on August 24, 2015, under NNM15558047L to include a Request for Information (RFI). <br /><br /><br />The DRFP is not a solicitation but is issued as an acquisition planning instrument and as a means of soliciting industry comments for use in developing the RFP. This draft does not commit MSFC to pay any proposal preparation costs, nor does it obligate NASA MSFC to procure or contract for these activities. This request should not be construed as authorization to proceed with, or be paid for charges incurred by performing any of the work called for in this DRFP.
<p><br />The purpose of the DRFP is to assist the Government in developing the highest quality RFP. Prospective Offerors in accordance with NFS 1815.201, Exchanges with Industry Before Receipt of Proposals, are invited to: (1) comment on all aspects of the draft RFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches; (2) identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements; and (3) comment on any perceived safety, occupational, health, security (including information technology security), environmental, export control, or other programmatic risk issues associated with performance of the work.</p>
<p><br />An Industry Day Virtual Meeting will be held on December 5, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. CT. The Industry Day Virtual Meeting is for informational purposes only. Information and instructions regarding industry day are contained within this draft RFP as Provision L.10, Industry Day Virtual Meeting. Attendance is not required nor a prerequisite for proposal submission. It is requested that all Offerors register a notice of intent to attend the Industry Day Virtual Meeting. This information should be sent to Stacey E. Hadavi by November 30, 2016 by 5:00 p.m. CT via email.</p>

<p><br />This requirement is a follow-on to NNM12AA08C which was awarded to Excalibur Associates, Inc. as a Firm-Fixed price (FFP) Mission contract with a FFP Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) element. The MMPS contract currently provides a variety of protective services for MSFC and MAF including physical security operations, personnel security, technology protection, emergency operations, and training requirements. <br /><br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services with a size standard of $20.5M.</p>
<p><br />It is currently estimated that the RFP seeking proposals from interested and qualified Offerors will be posted on or about January 13, 2017. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the eventual release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>

<CONTACT>Kevin Alvarez , Contract Specialist, Email kevin.alvarez@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Somalogic Inc, 2945 Wilderness Pl, Boulder, CO 80301, to procure a SOMAscan HTS Assay Kit that is required by the Center for Human Immunology for plasmatic protein detection.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The research performed in the Center for Human Immunology's (CHI) Flow Cytometry Section involves characterizing the protein expression in human sera. Previously, the lab had used a Luminex platform for proteomics, but has now installed a SOMAscan machine to do this work. In order to run assays on the SOMAscan, CHI needs to purchase kits for plasmatic protein detection.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a SOMAscan HTS Assay Kit, that the laboratory will use for plasmatic protein detection on the SOMAscan machine. The laboratory will now purchase these kits in the 84-sample format instead of the 24-sample format that has been purchased previously, because this will allow the lab to reduce "batch effect" and improve sample consistency.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	SOMAscan HTS Assay Kit 1.3k, Human Plasma</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that SomaLogic is the sole proprietor of this unique reagent technology. No other businesses in the market offer assays capable of clearly examining proteins of a single assay to the same magnitude as SomaLogic.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325414, Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing, and the Small Business Size Standard is 1250 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-88 (May 16, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by December 7, 2016 at 9:00AM EST and must reference synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2017-039-KMA.  Responses shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6127, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Kevin Alvarez. Responses may be submitted electronically to kevin.alvarez@nih.gov.  Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in December.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for December* is December 1, 2016 to December 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 16-Reg6 and must be located within Region 6.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<DESC>This is not a formal solicitation and no contracts will be awarded from this Sources Sought.  This is only seeking information for potential contractors that can provide this service in the Natchitoches, LA service area. The information derived from this Sources Sought will be used for Market Research only.

The Alexandria VA Health Care System is seeking interested vendors/contractors to provide Readjustment Counseling to veterans of the military service.  .

Period of Performance will begin 01 April 2017 and end 31 March 2018.

This is planned to be a base contract with four (4) one (1) year option periods.  A total of 5 years of service is planned for this contract.

Services provided will be in support of the Alexandria VA Health Care System and the Rapides Parish Veterans Center in Alexandria, LA.

Services will be provided at the contractor s facility located in or around Natchitoches, LA postal zip code 71457.

These services will be provided to veterans that live within a 50 mile radius of the Natchitoches, LA area and these services are closer than travel to the Rapides Parish Veterans Center in Alexandria, LA.  Area is 25 miles south of Natchitoches, LA and 50 miles north, east and west of Natchitoches, LA.

Description of Services Provided:  Contract readjustment counseling includes the same mix of social and psychological services as provided at Vet Centers, with the exception of community outreach.  The purpose of the contracts program, as intended by Congress and implemented by VA, is for the provision of readjustment counseling and not for general mental health services.  Contract readjustment counseling may include social services and/or psychotherapy, but the services provided must address readjustment difficulties deriving from military duties and/or homecoming experiences.  The provision of services for problems not having a clear and distinct relationship to military duty and readjustment to civilian life from military duty, is not authorized. 

Contractor will not be required to provide general mental health services, but only readjustment counseling for the problems that bear a distinct and crucial relation to readjustment from military duty, for example:
Psychosocial problems related to exposure to war trauma.
Other aspects of duty in the Southeast Asia combat zone, or other zones previously cited.
Post-traumatic stress disorder.
Stresses unique to military duty during conflicts.
Psychological concern over a possible service connected condition.
Psychosocial problems related to substance abuse clinically associated with military duty or post-military readjustment.
Post combat zone experiences to include homecoming and re-entry experiences.
Post military discharge environmental stressors exacerbating the effects of military duty stressors.
Psychological concern over possible exposure to chemical and/or biological agents in the war-zone.
Generalized alienation from society manifested by interruption of normal readjustment processes.
Psychosocial problems about type of military discharge other than dishonorable.
Financial difficulties created by the loss of income as a result of active duty service.
Difficulties created by the reversal of roles within the marriage as a result of the active duty service of one or both member of the marital couple.
Psychological stress upon the marriage created due to the disability incurred by one of the marital partners as a result of the active duty service.

The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract mechanism.  

A visit shall consist of a minimum of 45 minutes.  A group counseling visit will consist of a minimum of 90 minutes.

It is estimated that 225 Individual sessions, 400 Group sessions and 6 Family Sessions will be conducted on an annual basis.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.31-1.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(b). There is a reasonable basis to conclude that the highly specialized supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Further, award of this requirement to a different source would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action will require the contractor to operate, maintain and integrate services of the Theater Operations (TOPS) software modules developed by Apptricity and modified by Apptricity to meet the Government's requirements. The TOPS software has undergone customized development specifically for the Government and is now an integrated, non-severable part of the Transportation Coordinators' - Automated Information for Movement System II (TC-AIMS II) system.</p>
<p>Apptricity retained ownership of the software and grants users' license rights to its software and to any derivative works, improvements, enhancements or modifications to it as a result of the work performed. Apptricity owns the source code for the TOPS module. For this reason, there are no other sources that can provide the necessary services for TOPS.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability in response to the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898 on behalf of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, hereby issues the following Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) to ascertain the level of interest of potential vendors desiring to contract for the management of Government Furnished Property (GFP) and Contractor Acquired Property (CAP) located at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) and subcontractor facilities. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. In the past, this requirement has been restricted to LMMFC, Dallas, TX CAGE 64059 under the basis of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 10.U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement" since the property is primarily located at LMMFC facilities and supports other LMMFC contracts. However all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration is requesting this information, in partnership with the Naval Sea Systems Command, to assist with the planning process to investigate system capabilities, to support development of design, operational and maintenance requirements for a system's integration into ships. The investigation will include the determination of the availability of systems and a review of their operational, design, and maintenance documentation. The investigation will also include collection and review of test data to ensure that the system can meet performance requirements and that it can undergo rigorous durability and operability testing that may be conducted shipboard, pier side, and/or in a laboratory setting. Test objectives are to identify, if needed, system improvements that would be necessary to support the shipboard integration of the equipment (system) and associated requirements for ship installation. Initial reliability testing will identify potential physical and functional challenges with systems integration to develop requirements for an approved system. <br /><br />(See the attached full description)</span></p>

<SUBJECT>In vivo Pharmacology and Animal Model Support for TRND
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NCATS-RFI-17-001 
<RESPDATE>011017
<ARCHDATE>02102017
<CONTACT>Amanda Gramlich, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 443-8761, Email amanda.gramlich@nih.gov - Jeffrey Schmidt, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 402-1488, Email schmidtjr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>Purpose
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information to assess the current state of the science and to further assist NCATS in determining the contract type best suited to meeting its needs. Specifically, the NCATS is seeking information regarding the capabilities of existing organizations that execute in vivo pharmacology studies that may require gaining access to existing non-commercially available animal models or to potentially execute needed animal model development/optimization or refinement. The objective is to determine the existing state in capable organizations of pre-emptive readiness: proactive planning and flexibility already in place or have the potential to be put in place to execute simple or highly complex tasks, specifically, but not limited to, the rare and neglected diseases space.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), will take procurement action in this matter. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. Further, neither DHHS/NIH/NCATS nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program at the NCATS has a diverse portfolio of projects that enter our program yearly. NCATS is disease agnostic in its effort to address the challenges of scientific translation and specifically, for the TRND program, drug development in the rare and neglected diseases space. Noting that there are approximately 7,000 rare diseases identified to date, this RFI seeks responses regarding how to efficiently and effectively structure and manage in vivo pharmacology tasks with a wide range of capable organizations (CRO, academic, others with capabilities to subcontract if needed) that will serve the needs generally outlined below, but that are also specifically undefined and diversified with respect to having or gaining access to specific rare or neglected disease animal models at any given time to conduct needed studies.</p>
<p>General needs</p>
<p>Currently, most of TRND's in vivo pharmacology studies are conducted using a one-off approach with customized arrangements being made for each study, more likely than not, dictated by where the animal model resides. This is often met by lack of available human and other resources to conduct a well powered study to support drug development efforts in a reasonable time frame. Therefore, the purpose of this RFI is to obtain extensive feedback on how a capable organization can effectively and efficiently coordinate resources needed to execute any given study or set of studies (potentially including animal model refinement/optimization or validation) such as those described below that may become the subject of a RFP.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop, optimize or use existing validated animal models to conduct in vivo pharmacology studies for rare disorders and neglected diseases for projects accepted into TRND's portfolio. These models are not able to be pre-determined as needs change depending on the disease, hence, access to both small (e.g., mice, rat) and large animal models (e.g., dog, cat monkey, pig) will be needed.<br />&bull; Characterize and validate animal models that require development or further optimization/ refining prior to use for studies involving a therapeutic under development. Therapies can cover a wide range of modalities; small molecules, and biologics (ex. antibody, proteins, cell and gene therapy).<br />&bull; Conduct necessary in vivo studies in validated models to support initial programmatic requirement of efficacy verification and further product development to involve studies such as:<br />o Defining PK-PD relationships<br />o Evaluating a range of endpoints and biomarkers in response to therapeutic candidate<br />o Determining correct route of administration (SC, IV, PO, IT, or ICV)<br />o Determining appropriate dosing parameters<br />o Determining appropriate formulation(s) for administration<br />o Examining toxicity/safety <br />&bull; Conduct, if necessary, in vitro pharmacology studies to test therapeutics in existing, refined or newly developed ex-vivo or cell-based models of the disease.</p>
<p>Information Requested</p>
<p>Below are several representative scenarios that may arise. Organizations are invited to submit a written response describing how they would specifically approach each of the scenarios outlined below as well as a comprehensive approach of how they would be prepared to overcome anticipated roadblocks/ potential barriers in tackling the general needs outlined above and a response-ready plan for likely scenarios such as those described below. Responses should be tailored to the information requested, taking into consideration the "Purpose" and "Background" described above. Please note that NCATS reserves the option to conduct a follow-up webinar with interested Respondents after the response period has closed. Should NCATS elect to conduct a webinar, Respondents will be notified via email within a reasonable time following the response deadline.</p>
<p>Respondents should address their experience and capabilities in the following areas:</p>
<p>Scenario 1: TRND needs to test the efficacy of drug (X), a small molecule under development in a rare disease mouse model (Y) for a neurological disorder. The mice are commercially available and your organization has the capability to administer the drug as well as collect the needed biological samples for analysis but lack (1) the disease area expertise and technical capabilities to test the samples (per specific assays accepted by the research community), (2) the know how to appropriately analyze and interpret the data. What would be your approach to getting the study done?</p>
<p>How would you approach this same task and conduct the study in a reasonable timeframe if your organization has the disease area and technical expertise but the mice, although accessible, reside in Dr. Jane D's laboratory at New University where resources are limited to ramp-up breeding?</p>
<p>Scenario 2: TRND needs (1) to determine the best route of administration of an enzyme replacement therapy, a biologic under development for a lysosomal storage disorder (A) and (2) to determine the appropriate dosing parameters to get a minimum and maximum effective dose in an animal model of this rare disease, (B). The model is not commercially available and resides in Professor John M's laboratory in Global Institute (GI) outside the United States. A very real potential exists that the patent and commercialization office at GI wants reach through rights to the drug once it is commercialized or before the start-up company is acquired by a large biotech or pharma. How would you address this problem?</p>
<p>How would you approach this same task if the model was accessible from a non US institute for a cost but animal model (C) is fragile and could not be transported long distance to the U.S. for proposed studies?</p>
<p>Scenario 3: TRND needs to define the PK-PD relationship for an antibody therapy in a large animal model of a rare disease (D) that closely mimics the human condition in critically ill infants. The model is acute and has to be generated by a specific procedure that requires additional medical equipment necessary to sustain life. Your organization does not have the technical/scientific/medical/disease area expertise or resources to execute the study. How would you approach this challenge?</p>
<p>What if a new but chronic genetic model exists but is not well established/validated in the research community or the primary endpoints/readouts are not as robust as originally believed but TRND needs to have convincing data in an accepted model to justify moving forward with IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies. How would you approach this problem?</p>
<p>Scenario 4: TRND just accepted a neglected tropical disease (Z) into its portfolio and studies in a highly infectious mouse model (E) is required to explore different formulations and dosing regimens to achieve desired efficacy. Your staff is highly trained and capable of conducting proposed studies but your facility is only Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 or 3 certified but, BSL 3 or 4 containment is required. How would you approach this problem?</p>
<p>What if your facility has the required BSL certification but does not have the appropriately trained staff to generate these acute infectious models and to run such studies?</p>
<p>Responses should be limited to 10 pages, not including the cover page, cover letter, table of contents and graphic displays of scenario models for resource integration and/or process maps.</p>
<p>RFI responses must include: 1) name and title of the primary point of contact for the response; 2) name and address of the institution or company; and 3) email address and phone number of the primary point of contact</p>
<p>Responses are due by January 10, 2017</p>

<DESC>The National Cemetery Administration is executing a Sources Sought for the sole purpose of identifying qualified Service Disabled Veteran Small Business concerns , OR, Veteran Owned Small Business and Other Small Business concerns in the event of insufficient, qualified Service Disabled Veteran Small Business concerns to furnish all labor, material, equipment, and supervision necessary to replace selected areas of the existing concrete walkways at Committal Shelter  C  at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery.  The overall estimated period of performance for this construction project would be 60 calendar days.  The respective project size is $25,000.00 to $100,000.00.  

An abbreviated description of the requirement and/or tasks is as follows: 

 Contractor shall demolish and remove the two (2) areas of the concrete walkways at Committal Shelter  C  as identified on the contract drawings.  Concrete shall be removed to the nearest expansion/control joints as designated on the contract drawings.  Saw cut all existing control joints as necessary to remove the concrete.  Contractor has the option to break out concrete around existing expansion joints to preserve the existing dowel installation.

Remove existing soil down to undisturbed native soil (subgrade), clean/prep the excavation area, and compact the subgrade to 95% prior to the installation of the engineered fill. 

Remove any formed void materials (cardboard), loose concrete, soil, and other materials under the existing perimeter as necessary. Reinstall a new 12-inch void forms and pre-treated plywood soil retainers.

Remove and carefully remove one tree, including as much of the root ball as possible. Coordinate with the COR for turn-over to the Cemetery.

Backfill the excavation with engineered fill in 18-inch lifts, compact to 95%, and then install 4  of crushed aggregate base material compacted to 95% prior to installing the new reinforced concrete walkway in accordance with the contract drawings and specifications.

Install the new concrete walkway in accordance with the contract drawings and specifications.  The new walkway shall continue the existing slope of the shelter slab to the edge of the walkway.  The slope shall be field adjusted to allow proper drainage away from the shelter and to match the two elevations.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method for producing multifunctional, structural, thermally stable nanocomposites with aligned carbon nanotubes. The invention improves upon current state-of-the-art graphite fiber composites by providing the same lightweight and mechanically strong characteristics, but also adds thermal stability and electrical conductivity. Thus, the invention can be used to provide a new class of mechanically strong, thermally stable and electrically conductive nanocomposites. Current state-of-the-art for lightweight and mechanically strong composites are graphite fiber composites. While graphite fibers have excellent mechanical properties, they do not have the desired thermal or electrical conductivities. Accordingly, when graphite fiber composites are to be used in high temperature environments, specialized high temperature or thermally conductive coatings are applied to the structure. These extra coatings add weight and cost to the ultimate structure. This invention, by way of nanocomposites with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), provides the lightweight mechanical strength of graphite fiber composites, but is also thermally stable and electrically conductive. The nanocomposite structure is a polymer in an extruded shape with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) longitudinally aligned and dispersed in the extruded shape along a dimension. The polymer is characteristically defined as having a viscosity of at least 100,000 poise at a temperature of 200 C. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent 8,608,993.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a compact tuned damper to reduce vibration occurring at a fixed frequency. Tuned dampers reduce vibration of the base structure by the dissipation of energy. The magnitude of the dissipated energy is proportional to the square of the displacement or velocity of the tuned mass, which in turn is proportional to the range of motion. The NASA damper design allows the slider mass to achieve 2x-3x greater range of motion than that found in conventional devices. This enables 4x-9x more effectiveness for the same size and weight; or the same effectiveness for a 4x-9x decrease in weight. The damper is also tunable and can be adjusted in effectiveness. The damper can be made small enough for use in wind tunnel tests or scaled up to large sizes, like those used in helicopters, wind turbines, or skyscrapers. A standard linear damper or elastomeric-suspended mass is often used to damp vibrations that could damage structures. The problem associated with a linear damper is the space required for its construction. For example, if the damper's piston is capable of three inches of movement in either direction, the connecting shaft and cylinder each need to be six inches long. Assuming infinitesimally thin walls, connections, and piston head, the linear damper is at least 12 inches long to achieve +/-3 inches of movement. Typical components require 18 inches of linear space. Further, tuning this type of damper typically involves fluid changes, which can be tedious and messy. Masses suspended by elastomeric connections enable even less range of motion than linear dampers.&nbsp; In contrast, the compact tunable damper includes a rigid base with a slider mass for linear movement. Springs coupled to the mass compress in response to the linear movement along either of two opposing directions. A rack-and-pinion gear coupled to the mass converts the linear movement to a corresponding rotational movement. A rotary damper coupled to the converter damps the rotational movement. To achieve +/- 3 inches of movement, this design requires slightly more than six inches of space. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent 8,672,107.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method to create Sequential/Simultaneous Multi-Metalized Nanocomposites (S2M2N) via supercritical fluid (SCF) sequential or simultaneous multi-metal infusion. The SCF infusion process provides deep impregnation of metal nanoparticles into a variety of materials, including those with challenging topographies and complex structures. The resulting multi-metallized nanocomposites can possess high electrical conductivity, permittivity, permeability, wear resistance/anti-penetrant, and radiation shielding along with high toughness. The technology has many applications, including use on solar sails, lightning protection or electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding for aerospace vehicles, automobiles, and electronic devices.&nbsp; It can also be used in flexible organic magnet materials, highly conductive flexible materials for electrodes and super capacitors, large scale deployable antennas to manage electromagnetic signals in space, gas separation and filters, catalysts embedded in flexible membranes, and gas sensors. Well-dispersed metal decorated nanotube or nanowire polymer composites have rarely been reported because of the excessive weight contrast between the decorated tubes and the polymer matrix. However, various properties, such as high electrical conductivity, permittivity, permeability, wear resistance, anti-penetrant, radiation shielding and high toughness are desirable and can be achieved with S2M2N metalized nanocomposites. Further, it is desirable to have nanocomposites that exhibit improvement in more than one of these properties and thus be capable of performing multiple functions. This invention provides a method to decorate pre-resided carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanotube, graphene, or nanowire surfaces in a polymer matrix with metal nanoparticles via supercritical fluid. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent pending.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br />The Heat Transfer and Alternative Energy Systems Group at NIST maintains the NIST500 mm and 1016 mm Guarded Hot Plate Facilities for the determination of steady-state thermal transmission properties of industrial insulation. A critical mission of these facilities is the development and characterization of thermal insulation reference materials. Thermal insulation reference materials are utilized by NIST customers for the calibration and validation of their thermal conductivity instruments. NIST issues thermal insulation Standard Reference Materials to the public through the NIST Office of Reference Materials.</p>
<p>Standard Reference Material 1450d, Fibrous Glass Board, is projected to be out of stock due to above average annual sales. A replacement batch, designated as 1450e, is now required. Procurement of the replacement batch is to be accomplished in two phases. NIST intends to analyze the responses submitted to this notice to identify vendors that can provide samples that meet NIST's criteria. In Phase I, NIST intends to procure a sample lot of 10 units from multiple vendors whose responses show that they can provide samples that meet NIST's criteria. The samples will be tested and analyzed by NIST using the factors established below. NIST intends to use the results of the testing of the aforementioned samples to help determine the acquisition strategy for the future Phase II procurement of approximately 450 units.</p>
<p>Draft Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST is seeking information on contractors who are capable of providing materials that meet the requirements below:</p>
<p>Material: The material is molded fibrous glass board, a specialty thermal insulation product that is manufactured by molding uncured rolls of fibrous-glass blanket under heat and pressure to provide a dense board at a specified thickness. Only molded unfaced fibrous-glass boards shall be acceptable because this material has superior density uniformity across the board.<br />Sample lot: The size of the sample lot shall consist of 10 units. The sample lot shall be manufactured from the same batch of raw material, i.e., manufactured from one continuous production run. The vendor shall provide a printed hardcopy of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the material.<br />Minimum Technical Requirements: Each unit of the sample lot shall have the following minimum technical requirements to be evaluated by NIST as described below.</p>
<p>a) Bulk density: 8 pounds per cubic feet (pcf) &plusmn;10 percent determined gravimetrically.</p>
<p>b) Dimensional: 1 inch &plusmn;0.031 inch thickness, trimmed to a final size of 24 inch &plusmn;0.031 inch by 24 inch &plusmn;0.031 inch determined by linear height gage.</p>
<p>c)Thermal conductivity: 0.033 W/(m&#8729;K) &plusmn;5 percent determined using ASTM Test Method C 518, "Steady-State Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Heat-<br />Flow-Meter Apparatus".</p>
<p><br />Interested parties shall describe the capabilities and experience of their organization and personnel as it relates to the requirements described above. Respondents shall NOT respond to this notice by delivering actual sample materials to NIST.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFI#: RRTO-17-3-RFI-01</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RAPID REACTION TECHNOLOGY OFFICE (RRTO) THUNDERSTORM TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION 17-3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title: Thunderstorm 17-3 Multi-Service Demonstration for Protection of Government Infrastructure and Facility Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distribution Statement A: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited</strong></p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS: Technology Demonstration Collaboration</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit technology demonstration candidates from private industry, government research and development (R&amp;D) organizations and academia for inclusion in future capability demonstration events focused on the protection of government infrastructure and facility security. The demonstration is sponsored by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO). The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the warfighter by demonstrating the capability and technology in an operationally relevant environment. The demonstrations will be used to inform decision makers of emerging and available technology solutions that enhance or improve existing capabilities with a focus on protecting facilities with waterfront areas.</p>
<p>Interested parties are welcome to submit their applications to participate in the demonstration. Technologies at all classification levels will be considered, but the demonstration is planned for the unclassified level. This RFI is for Thunderstorm 17-3, with demonstrations planned for spring 2017 in the mid-Atlantic region.</p>
<p><strong>The application deadline is 5:00 PM EDT on 6 January 2017.</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is NOT a solicitation for procurement or other acquisition proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p><strong>B. BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for technology developers to demonstrate new and evolving technological capabilities in an operationally relevant environment, as well as to obtain insight into federal technology gaps and emerging needs. The demonstration environment enables a collaborative working relationship between government organizations, academia and industry. This promotes the identification of emerging needs and assessment of maturing technologies with the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the Department of Defense and interagency partners. Thunderstorm provides a realistic demonstration environment for technology developers to interact with operational personnel. Materiel solutions brought to the event are at a technology readiness level (TRL) of 4 or greater (reference DoD TRL definition: http://www.acqnotes.com/acqnote/tasks/technology-readiness-level).</p>
<p>The Thunderstorm technology demonstration involves individual or multiple technologies and is conducted with interagency partners. The technology developer provides the capability for demonstration and personnel for installation and integration into the overall demonstration. The technology developer operates the system during the demonstration and uninstalls the system upon completion. The Thunderstorm staff plans, coordinates and assists with the associated logistics of the technology demonstration, and provides limited assistance for the installation and integration efforts. The Thunderstorm staff will not assist with engineering changes to the demonstrated technology or system.</p>
<p>Industry, academia and other government organizations are invited to submit demonstration applications addressing innovative technologies leading to possible government/industry collaboration for further development of emerging capabilities or fielding of mature capabilities.<br /><br /><strong>C. DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Thunderstorm 17-3 field capability demonstration will focus on the protection of government infrastructure and facility security. Two demonstration events are planned. The 17-3A event will primarily focus on developmental technologies (TRL 4-7) and is planned to be conducted over a two week timeframe in April 2017 at a TBD location in the mid-Atlantic area. The 17-3B event will primarily focus on mature technologies (TRL 8-9) and is planned to be conducted over a two week timeframe in June 2017 at a TBD location in northern Virginia or southern Maryland area. Participation may not necessarily require the demonstrator to be present the entire period. Select participants may also be invited to attend a follow-on demonstration. Under the direction of RRTO, the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) will lead the 17-3 demonstration effort, and the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program (SMDP), Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), and the Army Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (APSEAG) will provide support as required.</p>
<p>The top-level objective of the demonstrated technologies is to detect, classify, identify, track, and respond to activities of interest that could be associated with gaining unauthorized access to a secure area with a primary focus on approaches from the water and land.</p>
<p>The notional scenario is an individual or group surveils a secure facility with both land and water access before attempting to enter the area. The secure area may be a port facility or simply located along a body of water. The area may have security features such as physical barriers, sensors and roving patrols. Protection is required at all times, in all types of land and water interfaces (coastal, tidal, riverine, etc.), terrains (beach, bank, cliff, etc.), vegetation (open, grass, brush, tress, etc.) and in all environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Scenarios will be timeline driven. A sample demonstration area is depicted in Figure 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SEE ATTACHED PDF FOR FIGURE 1</p>
<p>Respondents are invited to submit technology demonstration applications related to, but not limited to, the following capabilities as they apply to the protection of government infrastructure and facility security:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &bull; Non-lethal deter, delay &amp; defeat systems of land vehicles, maritime vessels and personnel<br />&nbsp; &bull; Sensors/systems providing integrated situational awareness with automated classification/alert/cross cueing/ video analytics/fusion/etc.<br />&nbsp; &bull; Sensors/systems providing detect, track, classify and mitigate land based personnel and swimmers (surface and subsurface) particularly as they transition from water to shore in the intertidal region.<br />&nbsp; &bull; Shoreline/dockside/pier surveillance with persistent wide area/extended detection, identification and tracking (EO/IR, SWIR, LIDAR, RF, acoustic, etc.), fusion.<br />&nbsp; &bull; Landside surveillance with persistent wide area/extended detection, identification, video analytics and tracking (EO/IR, SWIR, LIDAR, RF, acoustic, etc.), fusion.<br />&nbsp; &bull; Shoreline/dockside/pier trespass deterrents &amp; warning systems<br />&nbsp; &bull; Cross-domain communication systems<br />&nbsp; &bull; High bandwidth secure wireless communications<br />&nbsp; &bull; Systems/Tools that assist with keeping a watch officer alert<br />&nbsp; &bull; Unmanned patrol and response systems<br /><br />All capabilities should emphasize automated operations with a goal of reducing or eliminating personnel requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integration into Established Sensor Interface System<br /></span><br />It is anticipated that one or more established government sensor interface systems will participate during the demonstration. If applicable to the demonstration technology and feasible for the participant, there is a desire to have mature technologies (TRL 8-9) integrate with a provided sensor interface system such as the Army's Integrated Sensor Architecture (ISA) 6.0 or analogues federal government system. While not a disqualifier from being selected, all applications are encouraged to address the ability and willingness to explore interfacing their capability with a select sensor interface system. The interface will be hosted on an unclassified government network.</p>
<p>ISA Description: ISA is an interoperability solution that enables components to join a network and make use of the functionality found there without requiring prior knowledge of the resources available on that network. Dynamic discovery is a core precept of ISA and is accomplished by requiring all members to announce the data they provide and functionality they can perform when they connect to the network. Members can change their capabilities at any time and can also search for other members that provide either data or functionality they are interested in. Dynamic discovery in this manner allows for members to adapt to a changing situation on the fly without potential downtime or reconfiguration and leads to the rapid utilization of new resources. Army Common Operating Environment (COE) Sensor Compute Environment (CE) has adopted ISA as their 3.0 baseline capability. The Army's Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) will provide support for interfacing with ISA 6.0.<br /><br />After a review of the demonstration applications, the government may invite candidates to brief their capability to support the selection process and/or invite candidates to demonstrate their capability during the Thunderstorm 17-3 demonstration event with the intent to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities. In addition, demonstrators may be selected for follow-on demonstrations/events at facility specific locations in support of future acquisition activities. Industry participation in the demonstration activities does not suggest or imply that the government will endorse, procure or purchase equipment.</p>

<p>The Government intends to make one award as a result of this solicitation. The Government will select for award the proposal that is most advantageous and represents the best value to the Government. The proposed four (4) evaluation factors will be: Technical, Price, Past<br />Performance, and Small Business Participation.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the Offerors will be required to give an oral presentation for up to four (4) hours and have an estimated one (1) hour for questions/answers to the Government's Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) for the Technical Factor inclusive of all sub-factors that will consist of the Manufacturing Plan, Critical Characteristic and Quality Plan, and Management Plan.</p>
<p>It is planned that the total allotted time for Oral Presentations will be five (5) hours. The offerors will be allotted up to four (4) hours to complete their presentations. At the conclusion of each offerors' presentation, the Government personnel will briefly caucus to ascertain if any clarifications of the offerors presentation are required. If the Government determines there is a need for clarifications, the written request for clarification will be presented to the offeror. The offeror will respond in writing with the appropriate answer that directly addresses the question asked by the Government.</p>

Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.<br />(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.<br />(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.uscis.gov/i-9<br />(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.<br />(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.

The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.<br />(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.<br />(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.<br />(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.<br />(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.<br />(End Provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />WBR 1452.211-80 Notice of Intent to Acquire Metric Products and Services -- Bureau of Reclamation - (Mar 1993)<br />(a) Metric Transition Plan. The Department of the Interior on December 6, 1991, issued a Metric Transition Program (Part 758 Department Manual Chapter 1) to establish and describe the program's policies and responsibilities. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), has developed a Metric Transition Plan to implement metrication in Reclamation. This plan describes Reclamation's overall strategy for using the metric system, defines general requirements and procedures for carrying out the transition, and details the tasks with milestones for Reclamation offices to complete.<br />(b) The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Trade Act).<br />(1) Section 5164 of Public Law 100-418, the Trade Act, amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.<br />(2) The Trade Act establishes September 30, 1992, as the implementation date (to the extent economically feasible) for Federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities.<br />(3) The Trade Act permits exceptions to the use of the metric system to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units.<br />(4) As a result of the Trade Act, the President issued Executive Order 12770 dated July 25, 1991, to implement the congressional designation of the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.<br />(c) Bureau of Reclamation Implementation. As a result of the Trade Act, Reclamation will, to the maximum extent practicable, use hard conversion and soft conversion metric systems in designing its construction projects, eventually phasing out use of the soft conversion metric system. Exceptions to this policy will only be made when such use is impractical, produces inefficiencies or market losses, or is not economically feasible.<br />(d) Expected Results. Reclamation expects its support of the metric system to result in increased use of the metric system by U.S. contractors, thereby increasing their ability to compete in the international marketplace. Increasing use of the metric system by U.S. contractors will eliminate possible restrictions on their bidding in the international marketplace and will eliminate any impact of economic blocks by metric countries restricting the acceptance of non-metric products.<br />(End provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />1452.215-71 Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information--Department of the Interior - (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below:<br />(1) 'Trade Secret' means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities.<br />(2) 'Confidential commercial or financial information' means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the Government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract.<br />c The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend:<br />'This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.'<br />(d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction.<br />(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.<br />(f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.<br />(End Provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />WBR 1452.222-80 Notice of Applicability--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies - Child Labor--Bureau of Reclamation - (Jan 2004)<br />(a) The clause at FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor, Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, does not apply to Bureau of Reclamation acquisitions to the extent that the contractor is supplying end products mined, produced, or manufactured in -<br />(1) Canada, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $175,000 or more; and<br />(2) Israel, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $175,000 or more.<br />(b) Nonapplicability thresholds for other countries are the same as listed in the FAR clause.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Shoulder Immobilizers. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Shoulder Immobilizers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Shoulder Immobilizers in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021). To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Shoulder Immobilizers will be established approximately May 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Shoulder Immobilizers. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Shoulder Immobilizers.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Shoulder Immobilizers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $479,253.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Four items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 81.41% ($390,201.00) of the total volume in sales ($479,253.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their email submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) CURRENT, UNRESTRICTED LICENSE = 35 POINTS. Potential contractors must submit a copy of physical therapy license (all previous licenses ever held, at a minimum, license numbers and the State(s)) with price quote; (2) RESUME/CURRICULUM VITAE = 35 POINTS. Potential contractors must submit resume/CV with price quote. Resumes/CV's must include information relating to: (a) Professional Education; (b) Certifications; and (c) Previous jobs; and (3) COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE = 30 POINTS. The Company must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past contracts and/or jobs, Government and/or commercial. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts/jobs. The offeror must list at least three contracts/jobs and include the following information. (1) Name of Government agency/Company; (2) Contract number, if applicable; (3) Dates of Service/Employment; (4) Total contract value/Hourly wage; (5) Description of contract work/Job duties; (6) Contracting Officer/Company Manager and telephone number; (7) Program Manager and telephone number, if applicable. (4) COST/PRICE: Price is not assigned an adjectival rating or scored. It will be evaluated to determine whether it is reasonable and if the quotation reflects an understanding of the requirement. This factor will be evaluated utilizing price analysis techniques identified in FAR Part 15.404-1. Analysis will include review of price reasonableness and balanced pricing. Offerors are cautioned that "materially unbalanced" prices and/or unreasonably high or low prices may cause your quotation to be deemed unacceptable and rejected. Technical and past performance, when combined, are considered approximately equal to cost or price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />EVALUATION APPROACH: The content of the written quotations, as well as information derived from discussions/negotiations, if discussions are held, will be evaluated to determine the degree and extent to which the requirements and objectives set forth in the solicitation are satisfied. No assumption will be made by Government evaluators regarding areas not defined in the offeror's written material/information provided to the Government for evaluation.<br /><br />EVAULATION METHODOLOGY: A team of Government personnel will evaluate the quotations. The quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the aforementioned factors. Any quotation that is unrealistic, in terms of technical approach, schedule commitments, and or costs (high or low) will be deemed unacceptable.<br /><br />BASIS FOR AWARD: Selection of the successful offeror will be made based on the evaluation criteria. The quotations will be evaluated and a contract awarded under the Best Value Continuum approach to permit tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors. This will allow the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror who meets or exceeds the technical acceptability standards established in the factors referenced above.<br /><br />The following FAR and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clauses are applicable: 52.204-4, 52.204-7, 52.204-9, 52.204-13, 52.204-16, 52.204-17, 52.204-18, 52.204-19, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.215-5, 52.217-8, 52.217-9, 52.223-5, 52.223-6, 52.224-1, 52.224-2, 52.225-25, 52.227-14, 52.227-17, 52.228-5, 52.232-18, 52.232-39, 52.237-2, 52.237-3, 52.237-7, 52.242-15, 52.242-17, 52.244-6, 52.245-1, 52.245-9, 352.203-70, 352.215-70, 352.222-70, 352.223-70, 352.224-70, 352.224-71, 352.226-3, 352.227-70, 352.237-70, 352.237-71, 352.237-72, 352.237-73, 352.237-74, 352.239-73 and 352.239-74.

Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced.

The FAR provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) CURRENT, UNRESTRICTED R.N. AND A.C.N.M. LICENSES = 35 POINTS. Potential contractors must submit a copy of registered nursing and American College of Nurse-Midwives licenses (all previous licenses ever held, at a minimum, license numbers and the State(s)) with price quote; (2) RESUME/CURRICULUM VITAE = 35 POINTS. Potential contractors must submit resume/CV with price quote. Resumes/CV's must include information relating to: (a) Professional Education; (b) Certifications; and (c) Previous jobs; and (3) COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE = 30 POINTS. The Company must demonstrate its record of successful performance in past contracts and/or jobs, Government and/or commercial. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts/jobs. The offeror must list at least three contracts/jobs and include the following information. (1) Name of Government agency/Company; (2) Contract number, if applicable; (3) Dates of Service/Employment; (4) Total contract value/Hourly wage; (5) Description of contract work/Job duties; (6) Contracting Officer/Company Manager and telephone number; (7) Program Manager and telephone number, if applicable. (4) COST/PRICE: Price is not assigned an adjectival rating or scored. It will be evaluated to determine whether it is reasonable and if the quotation reflects an understanding of the requirement. This factor will be evaluated utilizing price analysis techniques identified in FAR Part 15.404-1. Analysis will include review of price reasonableness and balanced pricing. Offerors are cautioned that "materially unbalanced" prices and/or unreasonably high or low prices may cause your quotation to be deemed unacceptable and rejected. Technical and past performance, when combined, are considered approximately equal to cost or price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />EVALUATION APPROACH: The content of the written quotations, as well as information derived from discussions/negotiations, if discussions are held, will be evaluated to determine the degree and extent to which the requirements and objectives set forth in the solicitation are satisfied. No assumption will be made by Government evaluators regarding areas not defined in the offeror's written material/information provided to the Government for evaluation.<br /><br />EVAULATION METHODOLOGY: A team of Government personnel will evaluate the quotations. The quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the aforementioned factors. Any quotation that is unrealistic, in terms of technical approach, schedule commitments, and or costs (high or low) will be deemed unacceptable.<br /><br />BASIS FOR AWARD: Selection of the successful offeror will be made based on the evaluation criteria. The quotations will be evaluated and a contract awarded under the Best Value Continuum approach to permit tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors. This will allow the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror who meets or exceeds the technical acceptability standards established in the factors referenced above.<br /><br />The following FAR and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clauses are applicable: 52.204-4, 52.204-7, 52.204-9, 52.204-13, 52.204-16, 52.204-17, 52.204-18, 52.204-19, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.215-5, 52.217-8, 52.217-9, 52.223-5, 52.223-6, 52.224-1, 52.224-2, 52.225-25, 52.227-14, 52.227-17, 52.228-5, 52.232-18, 52.232-39, 52.237-2, 52.237-3, 52.237-7, 52.242-15, 52.242-17, 52.244-6, 52.245-1, 52.245-9, 352.203-70, 352.215-70, 352.222-70, 352.223-70, 352.224-70, 352.224-71, 352.226-3, 352.227-70, 352.237-70, 352.237-71, 352.237-72, 352.237-73, 352.237-74, 352.239-73 and 352.239-74.

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>

<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work 
BXD Chiller #4

The work will be on a York International, water cooled chiller.  Model # YKQSQRK2DBG5, SERIAL # SAWM460440.  The reason for the Emergency is because this chiller is one of the main chillers for the campus chiller plant which supplies chilled water to all healthcare buildings including critical areas such as ICU, operating rooms, and the Emergency Department.  In addition, the work to be performed is exploratory and is necessary to determine the problem with the chiller.  This will involve partial disassembly of the unit and appurtenances.  Once the problem is understood, additional work will have to be performed for the repair.  Therefore, it is critical that this work be performed immediately.

Work is to be performed at Chiller Plant 2 in Building 3. The contractor will isolate all sources of energy following appropriate lock out - tag out procedures. They will remove all electrical conduit and wiring from the motor. The contractor will remove any vent pipe that is in their way while working overhead. The contractor is responsible for removing any chill water pipe or condenser water pipe without interrupting service. They will also remove any lighting. 

They will setup and secure to the floor an  A  frame to remove the motor. They will lower the motor to the floor and place on a cart to be moved to another location in room 1A185. They will then remove the rotor from the compressor and check the runout and thrust on the impeller and remove it. 

They will set the impeller on a cart and move it to another location in room 1A185. They will then re-position the  A  frame over the compressor to disassemble the compressor to perform an internal inspection of the compressor. They will also cover and seal all openings. 

Contractor is to provide a written proposal for necessary repairs including a description of the problems once they are determined.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Management Advisor is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations and management for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in Washington, DC and the field. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. The Senior Management Advisor will be required to travel to OTI field offices that are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence. The incumbent will also spend time at OTI headquarters in Washington, DC. The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division or his/her designee. The Senior Management Advisor spends his or her time working side by side with OTI Washington staff and with country program implementation teams in the field. All field activities, and the majority of the headquarters activities supported, are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>This position is a very senior-level intermittent position that requires an experienced professional who has overseas experience in diplomacy and can effectively and efficiently function in complex, difficult and unstable environments. The Senior Management Advisor is extremely knowledgeable in administrative management functions and the manner, historical style and procedures employed by the U.S. Government in the normal conduct of its business with emergency, transitional, and development activities overseas. Administrative management functions include management analysis, human resources in relation to U.S. and foreign national Personal Services Contractors, general services (which include vehicle management, real and personal property management, and equipment and facilities maintenance), records keeping and management, operating budgets, International Cooperative Administrative Support Services (ICASS), security, and contracting and procurement. A thorough comprehension and proven record of performance in these functions is an absolute necessity for a Senior Management Advisor to meet the requirements of the position. The successful candidate will be able to identify key leaders in the field and Washington, and establish sound professional relationships with them, to ensure the success of OTI's programs in transition countries overseas. Excellent analytical skills and the ability to grasp and resolve problems quickly are essential.</p>
<p><br />CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Management Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.

The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Management Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, Northampton VA Medical Center located at 421 North Main Street, Leeds, MA 01053 is seeking a contractor to provide NO 2 Heating Oil for Residential Quarters for the period of date of contract through September 30, 2016.  
The agency will require an estimated 25,000 Gallons of the Heating Oil, in accordance with the statement of work
This solicitation is set aside for Service Disable, Veteran Owned Small business.
STATEMENT OF WORK: 

Provide No. 2 Heating Oil for Residential Quarters at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Central Western Massachusetts, in Northampton (Leeds), MA, for the period date of contract, through September 30, 2017.  The agency will require an estimated 25,000 Gallons of Heating Oil.  The supplier shall calculate heating degree days to schedule fuel deliveries but will also be available on a will-call/as-needed basis for emergencies or extremely cold periods when higher fuel consumption could affect calculated heating degree days.   The agency has an internal policy to provide its tenants a 3-day notification for planned deliveries.  We generally make these notifications on Fridays for delivery the following week.  Planned deliveries shall be on Tuesday mornings starting at 8:30 AM EST.  All fuel deliveries (except emergencies) have to end by 3 PM EST to prevent overtime expenses by the agency.

Deliveries are to the following locations: 
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 17 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 18 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 19 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 21 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 22 - two (2) 275 Gallon tanks (both tanks are next to each other in the garage and the fill pipes are within arm s reach of each other   no truck repositioning is required) 
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 23 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks

Most residential quarters above have 1 tank on each side of the building except Qtrs 22.  This will require re-positioning labor of the hose or truck at each building in order to make the deliveries.  Local points of contact for deliveries are Tony Methot at (413)584-4040 ext 2222 or Ron Shepard at (413)584-4040 ext 2211. 

Special Requirements: 
A certification from the fuel supplier is required for each shipment to include: 
1. Name of fuel supplier 
2. Date of delivery 
3. Volume of fuel delivered in shipment per location.
4. Either separate invoice for each tank or a breakdown by tank on one invoice 
5. Sulfur content of the delivered and the method used to determine the content (note) less than or equal to .3 weight percent sulfur in the fuel as regulated by the State of Massachusetts 

The fuel supplier must submit a comprehensive Spill Prevention & Response Plan for approval before an award will be made.  The supplier must prove that they can effectively prevent and contain any fuel spills and prevent contamination to the surrounding ground, storm drains or downhill contamination to local waterways.  The contractor must certify that their drivers have been trained on spill prevention.  They must also prove that they have an effective means of communication during a spill containing 10 or more gallons.  This plan shall include emergency contact numbers for:  their own company, remediation companies and State & Federal authorities in the event of a major fuel spill containing 10 or more gallons.  The agency has its own spill plan and does deploy storm drain covers during each delivery.  The agency also has a Safety department that will make required State & Federal notifications in the event of a spill.  This does not relieve the contractor from knowing what to do or who to call during the unlikely event of major oil spill.

All interested parties MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAMS) Database and the Vetbiz database.   Contractors may submit all proposals and quotes to the Purchasing Agent Patricia Newberry no later than December 8, 2016  at 12PM.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<p style="tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt">15. SURVEILLANCE: Items that require inspection will be periodically monitored after completion of work to assure that the required service has been accomplished IAW the contract.</p>
<p>********************************************************************************************<br /><br />QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN FOR AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR</p>
<p><br />This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Statement of Work (SOW). It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Service Delivery Summary (SDS).</p>
<p>The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish and not the details of how the Contractor accomplishes the work.</p>
<p>This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in providing Aerobic Instruction. A service contract to provide this service is the best means of achieving this goal for Fitness Center Customers.</p>
<p>The Government retains the right to inspect any item included in the contract, including tasks not shown on the SDS. These services should be inspected in the same general manner as periodic surveillance items. The results of these inspections are documented and, if necessary, provided to the Contracting Officer (CO) for action. Should a discrepancy be observed, the CO will handle each documented discrepancy on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. Good management and use of an adequate control plan will allow the contractor to operate within specified performance requirements. The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.</p>
<p>In this contract, the quality control program is the driver for product quality. The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success.</p>
<p>Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.</p>

<p style="tab-stops: 0in 27.0pt">15. SURVEILLANCE: Items that require inspection will be periodically monitored after completion of work to assure that the required service has been accomplished IAW the contract.</p>
<p>********************************************************************************************<br /><br />QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN FOR AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR</p>
<p><br />This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Statement of Work (SOW). It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Service Delivery Summary (SDS).</p>
<p>The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish and not the details of how the Contractor accomplishes the work.</p>
<p>This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in providing Aerobic Instruction. A service contract to provide this service is the best means of achieving this goal for Fitness Center Customers.</p>
<p>The Government retains the right to inspect any item included in the contract, including tasks not shown on the SDS. These services should be inspected in the same general manner as periodic surveillance items. The results of these inspections are documented and, if necessary, provided to the Contracting Officer (CO) for action. Should a discrepancy be observed, the CO will handle each documented discrepancy on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. Good management and use of an adequate control plan will allow the contractor to operate within specified performance requirements. The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.</p>
<p>In this contract, the quality control program is the driver for product quality. The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success.</p>
<p>Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.</p>

<DESC><br />This amendment is issued for clarification purposes. Clarification is<br />provided as follow:
<p>Requirement/Question 1: Must include Period Preventive Maintenance (PPM)<br />package to include calibration IAW manufacturer's recommendation (at least<br />annually and upon request response-response time negotiable upon<br />procurement) to maintain accuracy.</p>
<p>Clarification 1: Customer wants to ensure that PPM and onsite maintenance<br />package will be available and get this protection for as long as they can<br />and cost of basic and extended (if available).</p>
<p>Requirement/Question 2: Must include warranty to at least match life-cycle<br />expectancy of product (with possibility of extension).</p>
<p>Clarification 2: The customer wants as long as a warranty as they can get.<br />If the manufacturer's warranty is "x" years, can this be extended by "y"<br />years, and if so, cost of each? If the basic manufacturer's warranty is the<br />only option, please state so and how long.</p>
<p>Requirement/Question 3: What's the requirement now on the indicator?</p>
<p>Clarification 3: There will be a "checker" manning the indicator at a safe<br />distance (approx 10 feet) as container is being weighed--so as long as they<br />can see the readout on the indicator (ie. such as a notebook/tablet-size,<br />etc. would meet requirement).</p>
<p>Requirement/Question 4: Does offeror have to have GSA contract?</p>
<p>Clarification 4: Since the procurement went full and open competition with<br />FBO, it does not have to be on GSA.</p>
<p>Requirement/Question 5: Closing date and time for questions and quotes.</p>
<p>Clarification 5: <strong>Questions for this requirement closed&nbsp;on 23 November</strong>. Quotes are due by 2 DEC 2016.</p>

(f) Eligibility. (1) Participation in the Mentor-Prot?g? Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act. (2) If a contractor no longer meets the definition of an Indian economic enterprise after award, the contractor must notify the CO in writing. The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility.

VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WEST LA CAMPUS ENHANCED-USE LEASE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Proposal and the solicitation number is VA101-17-R-0277. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB). 

This procurement is for an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WEST LA CAMPUS, CA. The VA envisions that development of the EUL Site will consist of repurposing Building 209 into approximately 55 permanent supportive housing units with services for Veterans, and shall be ready for occupancy almost immediately, but no later than January 1, 2017.

Building 209 is considered a turn-key facility for the purpose of providing housing for homeless Veterans.  An extensive renovation of the building was completed in 2014 and it is currently occupied by Veterans/tenants in the Compensation Work Therapy Program.  The building has approximately 55 housing units, comprising of 32 studios and 23 one-bedroom units (4 of which are Bariatric units).  Each unit is self-contained with a small kitchen dining area, full bathroom and sleeping area.  A site plan and floor plans of the building are at Attachment C.  As a part of this EUL project, the Housing Authority City of Los Angeles (HACLA) has allocated 55 Project Based HUD VASH vouchers to Building 209.  The VA has completed the Federal requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
 VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - VOSB firm must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to EUL.Team.Management@va.gov and a copy ccd to maina.gakure@va.gov by Dec 5, 2016 and a response to the questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 531390 (Other activities related to real estate). This solicitation closes on December 14, 2016 at 12:00 noon (EST). Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov or 202 461 6849 or Paul Macpherson at Paul.Macpherson@va.gov or 202-461-5682. Interested prime contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov and verified in VIP data base as VOSB or SDVOSB

<p>I.	GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1.	SOLICITATION NO.: SOL-OTI-17-000009</p>
<p>2.	ISSUANCE DATE: November 28, 2016</p>
<p><br />3.	CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: December 13, 2016, 12:00 pm Eastern Time</p>
<p>4.	POSITION TITLE: Senior Management Advisor - Worldwide</p>
<p>5.	MARKET VALUE:</p>
<p>This position has been designated as a "tandem" position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-14 ($87,263 - 113,444 per annum) or GS-15 ($102,646 - 133,444 per annum) equivalent level, non-locality pay. Final compensation will be negotiated within the GS-14 or GS-15 equivalent levels based upon the selected candidate's salary history, qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, and educational background as reported on AID-302-3. For selected candidates whose salary has been established on a Federal pay scale (i.e. General Schedule) or its equivalent, the base salary (not including locality pay) of their grade/step will be the basis of the salary negotiation. The final salary will be negotiated at a step on the General Schedule WASHINGTON-BALTIMORE-ARLINGTON, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Salary Table articulated as an annual rate amount.  The selected candidate will be eligible for applicable allowances as described in Section VI on the same basis as U.S. government employees if assigned temporary duty in foreign areas. As this is a Worldwide, non-locality position, incumbents who do not live in the DC metropolitan area will be provided with travel and/or per diem if they are required to work in Washington, DC.

Similarly, applicants who apply for the GS-14 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-15 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-15 level. Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications for should submit separate applications for the GS-14 and GS-15 positions.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Management Advisor is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations and management for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in Washington, DC and the field. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. The Senior Management Advisor will be required to travel to OTI field offices that are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence. The incumbent will also spend time at OTI headquarters in Washington, DC. The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division or his/her designee. The Senior Management Advisor spends his or her time working side by side with OTI Washington staff and with country program implementation teams in the field. All field activities, and the majority of the headquarters activities supported, are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>This position is a very senior-level intermittent position that requires an experienced professional who has overseas experience in diplomacy and can effectively and efficiently function in complex, difficult and unstable environments. The Senior Management Advisor is extremely knowledgeable in administrative management functions and the manner, historical style and procedures employed by the U.S. Government in the normal conduct of its business with emergency, transitional, and development activities overseas. Administrative management functions include management analysis, human resources in relation to U.S. and foreign national Personal Services Contractors, general services (which include vehicle management, real and personal property management, and equipment and facilities maintenance), records keeping and management, operating budgets, International Cooperative Administrative Support Services (ICASS), security, and contracting and procurement. A thorough comprehension and proven record of performance in these functions is an absolute necessity for a Senior Management Advisor to meet the requirements of the position. The successful candidate will be able to identify key leaders in the field and Washington, and establish sound professional relationships with them, to ensure the success of OTI's programs in transition countries overseas. Excellent analytical skills and the ability to grasp and resolve problems quickly are essential.</p>

She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice is being issued for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the USDA, ARS.</p>
<p>ARS is conducting an additional Market Survey to identify the availability and interest of qualified Small, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HubZone), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), certified 8(a) firms, and SBA approved Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms as potential sources for Design-Build for the CNRC Renovation, located at Houston, Texas. This Market Survey is intended to determine small business capabilities in managing some of the more challenging and unique aspects of this project.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 236220 (Construction) with a Size Standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The CNRC was constructed in 1988 and is a unique cooperative between the USDA, ARS, the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. The CNRC mission is dedicated to defining the nutrient needs of children, from conception through adolescence, and the needs of pregnant women and nursing mothers. Scientific data generated from CNRC enables healthcare providers and policy advisors to make dietary recommendations to improve the health of today's children and future generations. <br /><br />Requirement:<br />Although the CNRC facility has been well maintained, the building systems are past their useful life and in need of renovation. The overall project scope includes a complete replacement of major systems in the building; including replacement of most HVAC equipment (air handling systems and exhaust fans, fume hoods), the fire alarm system, roof, elevators, and various updates of building finishes. The scope of work also includes modernizing the auditorium, enclosing 5,000 gross square feet of patios, and to repurpose a large portion of the cafeteria for administrative space. The Estimated Cost of Construction for the CNRC Renovation at Houston, TX, is $25 million. The proposed construction at CNRC will be performed on an active research and medical facility.<br /><br />The Bridging Documents (BD) will consist of a complete 35% design submission. The Design Build Contractor (DBC) will use the BDs as the basis to complete a set of construction documents. As stated above, the purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to identify prospective Small, SDB, SDVOSB, HubZone, WOSB, Certified 8(a) firms, and SBA approved Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms to provide Design-Build services associated with the Renovation of the CNRC. The current goal for ARS is to complete the BDs by April, 2017, and to award the construction contract before the end of November, 2017.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. Interested firms are invited to respond to this announcement by providing the following information:<br />1. Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.<br />2. Firm's level of interest in competing on the solicitation when it is issued.<br />3.

Firm's Bonding Capacity (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars) . <br />5. Provide two examples of roof repair/replacement on an occupied high rise building within the past seven years. <br />6. Provide at least one example of total HVAC system replacement in a confined space utilizing component parts within the past seven years. Include projects/examples that required boom crawler cranes (specialty lifts) for bringing the components to the final physical destination in a high rise environment.<br />7. Provide two examples of successful phased construction in an active laboratory/ research environment within the past seven years.<br />8. Provide at least one example of replacing an existing operational zoned, addressable fire alarm system, with a fully-addressable fire command center within a high rise building.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION EXISTS. THIS REQUEST IS INTENDED ONLY TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF PROSPECTIVE DESIGN BUILD FIRMS. <br />The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought announcement. The deadline to respond to this notice is 9 December 2016, 2:00 pm Eastern. No site visits to the facility are permitted. Requested information shall be limited to no more than 10 pages.

<p>9 Oct 14 - FORMAL SYNOPSIS - Contract Field Teams (CFT)<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></span></span><br />This announcement constitutes a Formal Synopsis for the Contract Field Teams (CFT) program located at Tinker AFB.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to award approximately 13 Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in two (2) competition pools:</p>
<p>(1) Full and Open competition pool: Approximately six (6) ID/IQ contracts to either Small or Large Businesses competing in the Full and Open competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government. <br />(2) Small Business Set-Aside competition pool: Approximately seven (7) ID/IQ contracts to Small Businesses competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Note: Offerors competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool may elect to compete in the Full and Open competition pool. Small Businesses will be evaluated in the appropriate competition pool(s) based on the offeror's selection located on the front page of the formal RFP (when released).</p>
<p>The Air Force will acquire this requirement through an Air Force Source Selection.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the resultant contracts will be FAR Part 15 ID/IQ contracts with Firm Fixed Price, Time &amp; Material, and Cost-Reimbursable line items. This is a non-commercial acquisition.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period will consist of a maximum seven years and six months. The basic period will be three-years (ends year 3), Option I will be two-years (ends year 5), and Option II will be two-years (ends year 7). The options will be priced at the time of contract award. At the end of any contract period, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, allows for continued services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. This clause will be incorporated and evaluated at the time of basic contract award. The solicitation and contract will expressly state that the clause at 52.217-8 may be used for additional ordering period (up to six months) at the end of any contract period and that the NTE rates specified in the contract for the ordering period existing at the time 52.217-8 is exercised will apply to the task orders issued during the new ordering period under the Option to Extend Services. Each task order will state a period of performance for the services ordered and may include clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, so long as it is incorporated and evaluated at the time the task order is issued.</p>
<p>This is a partial Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 336411.</p>
<p>The Line Item Description will be as follows:<br />X001 - Firm Fixed Price (FFP) <br />X002 - Overtime in support of FFP (FP) <br />X003 - Surge (FP) <br />X004 - Over and Above (FFP)<br />X005 - CAP/CAS (CR)<br />X006 - Time and Materials (T&amp;M)<br />X007 - Overtime in support of T&amp;M (T&amp;M)<br />X008 - Material/Non-Material (T&amp;M)<br />X009 - Travel (CR)<br />X010 - Transition In (FFP)<br />X011 - Transition Out (FFP)<br />X012 - Data (NSP)<br />X013 - Post Award Conference (CR)</p>
<p>Deliveries and locations will be cited on individual task orders. FOB Origin and Destination.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to establish a competitive, performance based service acquisition (PBSA) for Contract Field Team (CFT) support. CFTs are available for use by all the Department of Defense (DoD) services and other federal agencies. A CFT is an awarded set of Contractor maintenance personnel who are provided with Government-furnished special tools, equipment, work space and supplies to accomplish modification/maintenance/repair effort on-site at operational Government locations, both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). The CFT program accomplishes depot, field and organizational level inspection, maintenance, modification and repair at operational Government locations worldwide. The program supports requirements for the active Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve components. CFT contracts are also used to support requirements generated by the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. The CFT program provides a rapid deployment workforce augmentation capability to field necessary skilled technicians on site anywhere in the world to support the Government's war readiness needs.</p>
<p>All award eligibility requirements will be stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at http://www.fbo.gov. Solicitation requests can be submitted to Wade Ward via email at bradley.ward.3@us.af.mil and Melony Adamski at melony.adamski.1@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

Summary Amendment A00003

Vendor Questions and Answers:

Q - Will the VA accept a Clinical Pharmacy Specialist that can be split to service both the Dickinson and Williston CBOCs? Or is the expectation that a CPS must be placed full time in both clinics? 

A   Yes.  In fact, the Handbook 1101.10 states that there should be approximately 1 CPS per 3 teamlets, or about 3600 patients.  In other words, neither location merits a full-time CPS.  It would be closer to 0.3 FTE each.

Q - Can the CPS be connected to support the CBOCs remotely, through telehealth/telephone/remote CPRS access?

A   Yes

<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Acquisition and Grants Office Eastern Acquisition Division located in Norfolk Virginia, proposes to negotiate a contract modification with Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC. on a basis of other than full and open competition in support of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) of the National Weather Service (NWS).  The contract modification will extend the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract from May 17, 2017 through February 16, 2018.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  This action is required to extend the current contract to ensure the completion and implementation of key product improvements; including support for GOES-R data, 2017 Tropical Season changes, and implementation of security improvements.  It is mission critical to sustain continuity of services and seamless operations of the NWS.  This acquisition is to provide uninterrupted contractor support services to meet the operational mission of the NWS.  AWIPS serves as the primary system for NWS forecasters, providing an extensible architecture to allow for highly available data communications, processing, and meteorological and hydrologic display capabilities in an integrated environment.  AWIPS ingests observation, sensor, and model data input, processes these data into weather products, allowing forecaster interaction in product creation, and disseminates these products to the public and specific stakeholders.  This mission critical system is the backbone for NWS to fulfill its mission of protecting lives and property.  As a result, AWIPS must maintain the highest possible level of availability, throughput and data quality in order for the NWS to effectively complete its mission.

<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, any firm that believes that it can provide the services as described that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

Reminder that all questions regarding this procurement should be emailed to the CO.  And that there would be no changes to the RFP unless the changes are posted to FBO in the form or a formal RFP Amendment document.

Hard copies are not required.  The RFP shall remain open until March 31, 2017 in the event the requirements by County are not filled.  However, it is in the vendors  best interest to get proposals in by the December 5th, 2016 cutoff.
Reminder that all entities have to be registered in the Government s System for Award Management (SAM) prior to receiving a BOA award.  Proposals may be submitted and evaluated however an award cannot be made until the SAM record is active.

Section C Terms and Conditions.  These are standard Government terms for Commercial Contracts and agreements.
Section E of the RFP was discussed at length especially the areas, 1) describing what to include with proposals when submitted and 2) the evaluation criteria which every proposal will be evaluated against.  
Offeror Questions and Government Responses are presented below.  Note: the RFP is not changed based on information below.  
Question:  What blocks do we fill out for submission of offer on the Government 1449 form?  Response:  Fill out blocks 17 and 30.

Question:  If there are multiple Nursing Facilities under one parent should we submit one proposal or would you need multiple proposals?  Response:  It really depends on how the parent does business.  The important thing to remember is that each home shall be evaluated and priced individually.
Question:  I wanted to know if there is any way to follow who wins the RFP without being part of the bidding process? Response: In accordance with Section E, Instructions to Offerors in the RFP, Individual non-award notifications will not be published. The Contracting Officer will publish an electronically-consolidated notification via a Federal Business Opportunities Award Notice once all sites  Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) have been awarded.

<DESC><strong>State:</strong> Mississippi<br /><strong>City:</strong> Moss Point<br /><strong><br />Delineated Area:<br /><em>North:</em></strong> Begin at the intersection of HWY 613 and Old Saracennia Rd; proceed east on Old Saracennia Rd to HWY 63.<br /><strong><em>East:</em></strong> Turn right on HWY 63; proceed south to Elder Ferry Rd.<br /><strong><em>South:</em></strong> Turn left on Elder Ferry Road, proceed northwest on Elder Ferry Road to the intersection of Dutch Bayou Rd, turn left on Dutch Bayou Rd, proceed west to HWY 613<br /><strong><em>West:</em></strong> Turn right on HWY 613, proceed north on HWY 613 to point of beginning at intersection of Old Saracennia Rd.<br /><br /><strong>Minimum Sq. Ft. (ABOA):</strong> 5,603<br /><strong>Maximum Sq. Ft. (ABOA):</strong> 5,883<br /><br /><strong>Space Type:</strong> Office<br /><br /><strong>Parking Spaces (Total):</strong> 0<br /><strong>Parking Spaces (Surface):</strong> 0<br /><br /><strong>Full Term:</strong> 10 years<br /><strong>Firm Term: </strong>5 years<br /><strong>Option Term:</strong> None<br /><strong><br />Additional Requirements:</strong><br />1. The space should not be located within the immediate vicinity of railroad tracks<br />2. Ease of access to and availability of public transportation and parking for visitors and employees<br />3. Sites which are located directly on a highway or six lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following instances:<br />- If the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block<br />- If the location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space<br />4. The Government prefers street-level, contiguous (same floor) space. Contiguous upper floor space on one floor which meets GSA lease criteria and has handicapped accessible elevator service to the government office floor is an acceptable alternative. It is preferred that the storage and / or multipurpose rooms are located contiguous with the main office space. However, these rooms only, and their associated square footage, may be separated from the main office area by a public corridor <br />5. Space should be Class A, professional quality office space. The overall dimensions of the space shall have a maximum length to width ratio of 2 to 1. It is preferred that blocks of space allow maximum flexibility for furniture placement, i.e., few or no columns or other obstructions, rectangular in shape, no curves or off-sets, and with large open areas. Space requiring ramps inside the office will not be acceptable. Columns in the space must be at least 20 feet from any interior wall and from each other (clear distance) and be no more than two feet square <br />6. Parking facilities shall be available at no cost, or at reasonable commercial rates, for visitors and employees within a two-block radius of the office. On-site parking shall be in accordance with local ordinance. If on-site parking is provided, it must include handicapped parking with lighting sufficient for security purposes for the parking area as well as for handicapped parking. If on-site parking is not available, parking for the disabled must be located within the same block as the space offered. Where public transportation is available, passenger stops must be no further than two blocks from the space offered. Availability of public transportation, public and commercial parking and on-site parking will be considered as award factors in evaluating offers; those which meet requirements will be given priority consideration in evaluating offers from potential lessors. (Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two-block radius of the space does not meet parking requirements because many the government contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour). When the government is the only building tenant and / or the only tenant utilizing the parking lot, additional accessible parking spaces for the disabled beyond those otherwise required or existing, (whichever is greater) shall be provided based on the size of the office. This shall be in addition to any reserved parking required by the government for employees with disabilities<br />7. Brokers or agents may represent the property owner, but written authorization from the owner is required. Subleases are not acceptable.
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>

<DESC><br />The following questions about the solicitation were submitted and have been addressed below.<br /><br />---An amendment (SF-30) to the solicitation is also issued and attached in response to the questions. For a proposal to be responsive, signed copies of all SF-30's must be submitted with the proposal.---<br /><br />Question 1:<br />From Drawing Sheet No. S-500, lower left corner of drawing, I believe that in the BILL OF MATERIALS, Item No. 7 is wrong as I copied from drawing to this email. As you see item no. 7 is called out as a Brostby HG-4037. I cannot find anywhere this brand name and from what I have found, I believe that it is supposed to be made by Crosby?<br /><br />Item 7 BROSTBY HG-4037, PN 1072494, 3/4 X 9 GALV. JAW END FITTING<br /><br />Answer 1:<br />Crosby HG-4037, PN 1072494, 3/4 X 9 GALV. JAW END FITTING is the intended callout, as it references an existing item in the dampener assembly. Drawing Sheet No. S-500 has been revised and is attached to this notice. It replaced the original Drawing Sheet No. S-500 in Attachment A - Drawing Packet. <br /><br />Question 2:<br />Also from the same Drawing Sheet No. S-500, upper left corner of drawing in the BILL OF MATERIALS, Item No. 5 Crosby No. MN G-414, # 1038004 SS thimble. I cannot find this in any of Crosby's literature, is this a good OR bad part number?<br /><br />Answer 2:<br />Crosby No. MN G-414, # 1038004 SS thimble is available online for reference.<br /><br />Question 3:<br />From Drawing Sheet No's. G-100, PLAN VIEW - FULL ARRAY and Drawing Sheet G-101 EXISTING PLAN VIEW - WASHINGTON SHORE. Both of these drawings are misleading to any viewer, because neither drawing is showing the downstream lower NAVLOCK guide wall and how the three (3) North carrier line support towers [N1, N2 and N3] relate to their positions. Also from what information that there is, I believe that they are not in a straight line.<br /><br />Answer 3:<br />Drawing sheets G-100 and G-101 are intended to show the existing layout out the array. The two drawings come from the same model used in the original installation and previous rope reinstallation.

<ARCHDATE>12022016
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA for Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL, who has a requirement for the URF-V2 Slim Flexible Video Ureter Scopes as they are the only company that makes uretero scopes with narrow band imaging that is compatible with existing equipment already purchased. In addition, Navy Medicine has tailored its employee training, workflows, and products based on this product line. This has streamlined costs and increased efficiency versus operating additional systems made and supported by other manufacturers. Therefore, Olympus America Inc. is the only known responsible source that can provide the URF-V2 Slim Flexible Video Ureter Scopes required for this procurement. See attached Justification and Approval.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be provided within two (2) calendar days from the date of this notice. Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirement. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Topic SOCOM10-006 sought the development of a MWS, with a smaller, lighter weight, and a more power efficient meteorological sensor than currently fielded systems. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The effort was to design and build a system that gives live day or night feeds, with visibility via a 360 degree picture of the surrounding area, in all weather conditions and altitudes, to measure current weather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The MWS was to be mounted on micro unmanned air vehicles or ground based standalone situations. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The system was to include a sensor/communications package that allows it to Identify Friend or Foe and transmit collected information directly to aircraft. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The system is needed to communicate in a language that easily is used by the current and future Command and Control (C2) systems that will allow a data overlay of collected information. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>When used as a static system, the MWS should have the ability to be camouflaged for the environment it is being placed in with an anti-tampering warning system.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The objective of the Phase I was to have the ability to automatically collect weather data from remote sensors and transmit data to C2 elements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The hand emplaced variant was to be small and lightweight enough to be carried to an area of operations by a Special Operation Forces operator team. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The system was to have the ability to report weather information which includes location; time, wind direction and speed; 360 degree horizontal visibility to beyond 4800 meters; sky condition and cloud heights; temperature and dew point; barometric pressure; measuring of precipitation water equivalent amounts; reporting peak wind direction and speed from the past hour; and provide warning of potential Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear (CBRN) contamination at the sensor site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Operators also should have the ability to remotely control the sensor. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Phase II effort sought the development of secure and undetectable MWS transmissions. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The sensors were to be networked to common C2 systems utilizing common messaging formats and data feeds. Resultant information could be instantaneously provided and exchanged with weather forces; other operators; planners; staff commanders; and global weather databases via visual displays (map overlays using common C2 mapping/tracking systems) and alphanumeric displays. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The System was to collect horizontal visibility to 10,000 meters and provide CBRN collection that would detect basic agents and radiological information with less than 20% false positive and with the objective of zero false positives. Additionally, the MWS should operate for 90 days without servicing.</span></p>

<DESC>This is NOT a request for quote. This is a notice of the Government's Intent to Award a Firm Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis to Standard Parking Corporation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD is made in accordance with FAR subsection 6.305, Availability of the justification.<br /><br />The CFPB currently leases office space to house approximately 200 employees, from Brookfield Office Properties, on several floors of 1625 Eye Street, NW. However, the building lease does not include parking. The CFPB currently has a contract with Standard Parking Corporation for these spaces at 1625 Eye Street. The CFPB is seeking to extend the lease for the 50 parking spaces for a period not to exceed twelve months, as the Agency is tentatively scheduled to move out of 1625 Eye Street, NW in September 2017. At this time, employees at 1625 Eye Street, do not have the option of parking at CFPB Headquarters at 1700 G Street.<br />CFPB intends to award a sole source contract to Standard Park<br />ing Corporation in order to continue the lease for parking spaces underneath CFPB's offices located at 1625 Eye Street NW, Washington, DC 20006. Three of the fifty parking spaces must be able to accommodate handicapped accessible vehicles, and the parking from Standard Parking Corporation provides for these. <br /><br />The Government will not consider any quotes submitted as a result of this announcement. The approved and executed "Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition" will be available for public review on FedBizOpps within the next few weeks. For specific questions, please contact, Matthew Chmielewski, Contract Specialist, at Matthew.Chmielewski@cfpb.gov or Vanessa del Toro, Contracting Officer, at vanesa.deltoro@cfpb.gov. <br />
