<DESC>Contracting Office Address NASA Acquisition Management Office, Code BA30, Stennis Space Center (SSC) Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000 Description NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer for the following White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Roof Replacement. NOTE  *****All Offerors shall note that all work as a result of this synopsis and subsequent solicitation shall be accomplished at the NASA White Sands Test Facility, Las Cruces New Mexico, 88004-0020*****  The work to be performed under this project consists of providing the labor, equipment, and materials to install a mechanically fastened, thermoplastic single-ply roofing system on buildings 113, 200, 201, and 203.  Install permanent fall protection system per specifications on all new roofs before roofing work begins. Test existing roof insulation for moisture damage and remove/replace insulation if necessary. Remove all debris, ballast material, and if necessary any damaged roofing. Install underlayment for the single-ply membrane.  Remove and re-install existing metal walkways, add membrane walkways and working platforms from roof access to/around roof top mounted equipment. With same material provide platform at roof access. Install two-way vents at the rate of one per 1000 square feet to allow any moisture trapped below the membrane to escape. Owner will remove existing lightning protection system and install new lighting systems on all roofs. Contractor shall install 8 (eight) inch wide walkpad material where conductor and air terminals for new lighting protection system are going to be installed. The order of magnitude for the procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000 and the effort shall be completed within 120 calendar days after issuance of notice to proceed. Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238160 and $12.0 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about August 18, 2003 with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about September 17, 2003. All offerors are reminded the firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO. The Cut-off date for questions in response to the solicitation and the site visit for this project is August 29, 2003. The clauses at 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, and 52.236-3, Site Investigations and Conditions Affecting the Work, will be included in any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. Accordingly, offerors or quoters are expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed.  An extremely important pre-proposal conference and site visit have been scheduled for September 21, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the White Sands Test Facility Rotunda (Building 110). Offerors shall send e-mail containing the following information on all personnel who will be attending the site visit:        Attendee's full name	       Company Name	       Phone Number 	   E-Mail Address	     Prime or Subcontractor E-mail shall be sent to: James.D.Huk@nasa.gov			   The information listed above is required in order to meet security requirements for access to the site.  Participants should allow up to 30 minutes to process through the main gate. Oral questions will not be accepted; but written questions will be accepted at the conclusion of the site visit.  Official written answers to questions will be posted as an amendment.  Offerors are encouraged to submit questions prior to the pre-proposal conference.   Offerors are strongly encouraged to attend the site visit conference to inspect the site to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.  In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT WSTF IS A UNIQUE FACILITY AND THAT THE WORK CONTEMPLATED BY THE MODEL CONTRACT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN COMMERCIAL SETTINGS.  WHILE ATTENDANCE AT THE SITE VISIT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THE EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS (EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY), ANY COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT ATTEND THE SITE VISIT MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY TO THE RFO.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address NASA Acquisition Management Office, Code BA30, Stennis Space Center (SSC) Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000 Description NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer for STGT Roof Replacement The project consists of removal of an existing single ply sheet, rock ballasted roof system and replacing the roof with a new four ply modified bitumen SBS roof membrane over a new one half inch polyisocyanurate foam board insulation mechanically fastened to the existing metal deck through the existing 5/8 inch gypsum board.  The new roof will be a mopped down application and have a mineral-surface cap sheet.	The roof application is for the Second TDRSS Ground Terminal Building and the Power Plant Building. Access exterior stairs will be added to each building consisting of a metal panel enclosure for controlled access and steel framed stair with FRP grate treads and landings.  Existing lightning protection and condensing units on the power plant roof will be decommissioned and re-commissioned by the owner and coordinated with the general contractor.  The General Contractor will remove and reinstall the condensing units from the roof of the power plant so roof removal and re-roofing may occur under the unit.  Scope includes removal and replacement of metal copings and flashing, and base flashing of all roof penetrations.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for software and hardware upgrade of an LMS Computer Aided Dynamic Analysis (CADA)-X System. The existing CADA-X structural dynamic test system is currently Unix based.  A system upgrade to a Windows based system is required. The upgrade will: (1) convert the Unix based software to Windows based software with 24 bit ADC technology; (2) upgrade the digital signal processing hardware modules from 16 bit to 24 bit ADC technology ; and, (3) upgrade the hardware controller to a 24 bit ADC technology. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from LMS North America, 1050 Wilshir Dr., Troy, MI 48084. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements.  LMS North America is the only supplier for upgrades to this system.  It is essential that full backward data compatibility be maintained.  This compatibility will insure that all structural dynamic test data sets acquired prior to this system upgrade can be accessed and utilized using the upgraded system.  LMS North America is the only supplier that has the required full backward data compatibility. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 15, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

The purpose of this solicitation is to establish a supply source to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for Bosentan (Tracleer) tablets and related services. The contract type will be a fixed price, indefinite delivery, requirements contract. The contract will be for a base year, plus four one-year option periods that will be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The estimated number of VA patients currently receiving Tracleer is 20. Due to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for patient monitoring, Bosentan (Tracleer) tablets, manufactured by Actelion are only dispensed through FDA approved specialty distributors (SD). The Tracleer Access Program (TAP) is a restricted distribution network for Bosentan (Tracleer) tablets, in conjunction with a patient database that follows patients treated with Tracleer. This program provides a mechanism to assist with two primary risk management goals for Tracleer therapy, pregnancy prevention and prevention of hepatic injury. The requirements of the TAP program can be viewed by accessing the FDA approval letter to Actelion (NDA 21-290) dated November 20, 2001. This letter may be downloaded from the following website: www.fda.gov/cder/approval/index.htm.=20 The Department of Veterans Affairs will purchase Tracleer and related services from an authorized SD. Only VA physicians will be authorized to prescribe Tracleer and register patients with the SD to receive Tracleer. The SD must provide the following services: 1.=09The filling of the initial prescription for authorized VA patients to be shipped within 24 hours to the patient=92s home, VA pharmacy or other location as designated by the VA physician and the shipment of refills within 48 hours.=20 2.=09Inserting two patient reminders in the monthly prescription, first, the approved Patient Medication Guide and second, a liver function test (LFT) and pregnancy testing reminder card. These will remind the patient to have LFTs checked; and, for child bearing potential females, testing for pregnancy checked on a monthly basis and the prevention of pregnancy using appropriate birth control methods. In addition, patients are reminded to contact their physicians if they experience adverse events or have questions. The SD must make a database entry to verify completion of this contact. 3.=09Generating a letter to the prescribing physician indicating that the initial prescription for Tracleer has been filled, with date and patient name. The letter will contain the name of the SD with a contact number for the physician to call if there is any need to alter the dosage of Tracleer. The letter will also remind the physician to check the LFTs monthly and that female patients should not become pregnant, or take Tracleer during pregnancy, and should have monthly pregnancy testing performed. The physician will also be reminded to report any adverse events to the Actelion Drug Safety Reporting Line (1-866-228-3546) and/or the FDA (1-800-FDA-1088). 4.=09Calling patients prior to scheduled shipments of the next month=92s medication and asking them if they are continuing on Tracleer. If they are, patients should be reminded of the need for liver function tests and asked if they have had a blood draw in the last month for reasons other than checking blood thinning. Female patients should be asked if they have had a pregnancy test within the last month and be reminded that they should not become pregnant while on Tracleer. 5.=09If patients have not had liver and/or pregnancy tests within the last month, the SD will communicate this immediately to the physician and remind the physician of the need for liver and/or pregnancy monitoring. The call to the patient and the contact with the physician must be logged. 6.=09If a planned refill does not occur, the SD TAP administrator will determine why. If there is a medical reason, the physician will be contacted to determine what the medical reason is, and if the issue is related to LFT elevation or change in pregnancy status. This information will be entered into the TAP database. Adverse events will be forwarded to the Actelion Director of Drug Safety for follow-up and reporting. 7.=09Delivery of Tracleer to patients shall be within 24 hours for initial prescriptions, within 48 hours for all refills, and shall be in accordance with all FDA regulations and TAP requirements.   =20 Bosentan (Tracleer) tablets are to be sold to the Government at prices no greater than Federal Ceiling Prices (FCP) as established on the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 65IB. The SD receiving a contract award as a result of this solicitation will provide the Bosentan (Tracleer) tablets at no greater than the FSS FCP price. The SD will include a flat fee, which is separate from and not included in the FCP price of the drug, for providing all of the above listed related services required by the FDA and this solicitation, as a separate line item.=20 This fee will be applied on a per prescription basis. Option year pricing will be determined by the current FCP price and offerors shall purpose a firm, fixed price, flat fee for services for the Base Year and each of the individual option years. However, FCP prices may change at anytime during the term of the contract and the changed price will immediately become the new price for Tracleer.

<DESC>FOB 8 CMc Pre-Solicitation Notice Announcement
 
The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. 
The following document describes the procurement for Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) services  for the proposed renovation and conversion of Federal Office Building 8, which is primarily a laboratory, located at 200 C Street, SW, Washington, DC, into an office building.   The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and various options for Construction Phase Services, which are described below. The Government intends to award a fixed-price contract with a financial incentive.  
The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. Stage 1 of the process will be a  Request for Qualifications, under which the Government will evaluate experience and past performance and advise offerors of their competitive viability. Thereafter, the Government will issue Stage 2, Request for Proposals, which will solicit price proposals, and additional technical evaluation factors.  Under this solicitation, all evaluation  factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).  
Project Summary. The building is approximately 46,280 gross square meters (557,700 gross square feet).  The project includes demolition, base building construction, and tenant fit-out.  During construction, the contractor must he  operate and maintain the chilled water plant, which feeds an adjacent building.  The building tenants have not been identified. The estimated range for construction cost, including tenant fit out,  is $95,000,000 to $115,000,000. Occupancy is anticipated by May 2007.  The renovation will be designed in metric units.
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor.   The General Services Administration (GSA) defines a CMc as a firm that  contracts directly with a building owner, here, GSA, to provide pre-construction services as well as general construction and construction management services. .  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with GSA, GSA's selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.
Services to be Provided. The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, as needed, to perform all required services to renovate the building, including, but not limited to, those described in this presolicitation notice.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMc will be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  
Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, cost estimates, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.
Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA.

During contract performance, the CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, means to achieve the best value in performance, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station intends to award a firm fixed price simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to JHRG, LLC of Spring Hope, NC for eight (8) protective covers for use on the eleven (11) meter Naval Special Warfare Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (NSW RHIB).  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The protective covers used on the NSW RHIB must survive harsh open weather environments as well as potential exposure to chemicals. The protective covers, previously acquired for one unit using the NSW RHIB, fabricated by JHRG, LLC of Spring Hope, NC are high strength, chemically resistant, light weight covers manufactured from Supreme Protector fabric that was developed, patented, and manufactured by JHRG, LLC.  JHRG LLC has spent 6 years and several million dollars of private R &D investment funding to develop, patent and produce Supreme Protector fabrics and threads, regarded as the strongest commercial woven textiles on the planet. No other known fabric (i.e. canvas, polyester, or polyethylene) typically used in the fabrication of commercial boat covers has the characteristics of this product. The key specifications that make this fabric ideal for the harsh environments in which the NSW RHIBs operate and deploy are as follows: a.  Lightweight (12.5 oz per yard) that makes the cover for an 11-meter boat weigh a total of ninety- two pounds.             b.  Non-absorbent - 100% wet strength after 6 months immersion in sea water c.  High break strength, toughness, and tear strength d.  Operating temperature range of –40F to +290F  e.  High abrasion resistance f.  High UV resistance (30% strength loss after two years exposure, approx.) g.  100%  strength after 6 months exposure to 10% detergent, sea water, hydraulic fluid, gasoline, toluene, kerosene, glacial acetic acid, perchloroethylene, 5% hypophosphate, 29% ammonium hydroxide h.  24 months guarantee  – no rip, no rot, no seam failure The only known material that can meet these requirements is the patented Supreme Protector fabric manufactured by JHRG, LLC who is also the only known source that has previously fabricated covers in this size.  Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 West Highway 98, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001. NAICS Code 326199 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. FSC is 2090.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC intends to negotiate additional scope under existing contracts, and solicit and consider proposals under a limited competition, only with the Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company and a team consisting of the Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Orbital Sciences Corporation, for the design, development, test, delivery, and flight certification of an Orbital Space Plane (OSP).	The existing contracts (including: NAS8-01098 with Lockheed Martin, NAS8-01099 with Boeing, and NAS8-01100 & NAS8-01097 with the team of Northrop Grumman and Orbital) currently provide for performance of OSP system requirements definition and validation, conceptual design, and system specification. This limited contractor group will proceed with the preliminary design of the OSP under the existing contracts, and will compete for the design completion, development, testing and delivery contract. The estimated period of performance will be through 2012. The nature of this acquisition requires that the current contracts with the three contractor teams be utilized to immediately provide for rapid design of OSP concepts to enable an initial operational capability as soon as practical.  This action will enable all three teams to design their OSP concepts concurrent with a limited competition for design completion, testing, delivery, and flight certification of the OSP as soon as practical.	The unusual and compelling urgency of the request is driven by the immediate need to develop an alternate human space transportation system for the International Space Station (ISS).	The nature of this requirement is an acceleration of a previously anticipated 2010 Initial Operational Capability of the OSP.	An assessment of ISS crew support and safety for both Crew Rescue and Crew Transfer missions makes the availability of an OSP system essential for NASA’s ISS mission.  The objective of the potential acceleration enabled through this action is to provide initial operational capability of the OSP system as soon as practical, and the associated benefits to ISS utility and crew, up to two years earlier (from 2010 to as early as 2008 or sooner). NASA/MSFC intends to limit competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-2 which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) when the Agency's need is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the Agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it continues work under existing contracts and solicits bids or proposals.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to design, develop, build, flight test, and deliver an operational OSP by 2008, in writing, to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on August 8, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a full and open competition basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>On behalf of the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA), the Department of the Interior’s Franchise Fund activity GovWorks will be managing several procurement actions that pertain to various aspects of the Federal Crop Insurance Program.  The first is a research and evaluation project with the objectives to: A) Improve the accuracy of the appraisal methods for alfalfa/grass mixture stand reduction appraisals listed in the Forage Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook.  B)  Improve the accuracy of the weight estimation procedures listed in the current Forage Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook for large round bales of forage.  C) Develop a methodology to assess forage quality to enable the writing of an accurate quality adjustment endorsement.  The second is also a research and evaluation project to ascertain the accuracy of the current wheat tillering factors (Table H) and the wheat tiller-to-bushel factors (Table I) contained in the current FCIC-25430 and FCIC-25430-1 Small Grains Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook, and (1) evaluate the accuracy of the current wheat tillering factors and the wheat tiller-to-bushel factors, (2) evaluate the feasibility of developing wheat tillering factors and the wheat tiller-to-bushel factor by locality and by variety, and (3) propose new wheat tillering factors and the wheat tiller-to-bushel factors (by locality and by variety if feasible) if research proves the current wheat tillering factors and the wheat tiller-to-bushel factors are inaccurate.  The third is a feasibility study to: A) Determine the feasibility of including dried-on-the-vine (DOV) production methods as insurable practices under the raisin crop insurance program; B) Identify and evaluate design weaknesses in the current raisin crop insurance program that render it vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse; and C), if RMA concurs, recommend specific program language to implement the recommended program design changes and incorporate the recommendations regarding DOV production.  Each of these programs will be identified in separate solicitations to be posted on the GPE, and will have separate and distinct Statements of Work attached.  Responses will require a Capabilities Statement, a Technical Proposal and a Business Proposal to be submitted; oral presentations will not be required.  The Government anticipates that these solicitations will result in Time and Materials or Labor Hour contracts..

<DESC>Sources Sought and Pre-Solicitation Synopsis Notice to provide COTS software for Recertification of Patent Practitioners and Examiners. 


USPTO is issuing a Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis to seek qualified sources capable of supplying commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software.  This procurement will utilize the newly issued Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). Under PTAG, the USPTO is authorized to limit the number of offerors to achieve maximum reasonable competition. Upon review of the responses to this Sources Sought/Synopsis, an RFP will be issued only to those offerors who are most qualified to fulfill the requirements, based upon technical product capability proposals submitted in response to this synopsis.  Vendors should identify with their submissions similar implementation to the USPTO requirements of their product. Those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised. USPTO may elect to request product demonstrations as part of the follow-on technical evaluation. USPTO may also elect, in accordance with the PTAG, to negotiate only with the most highly rated vendor. The PTAG was published in the 2003 Federal Register (http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html, search on “PTAG”) 

USPTO has a requirement for COTS software to automate the assessment of approximately 28,000 Patent Practitioners and 4000 Patent Examiners.  The software will be used to implement the following initiatives of the USPTO 21st Century Strategic Plan: 
§	Monitor Practitioner Adherence to Rules of Practice: Periodic Recertification for Registered Practitioners
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/strat21/action/lr1cp51.htm
§	Certification of Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities of Examiners Before Promotion to GS-13
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/strat21/action/t10p21.htm
§	Re-certification of Knowledge, Skills, and Ability of Primary Examiners, including Legal and Automation Training of Primary Examiners
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/strat21/action/t9p20_22.htm

The software shall enable a Web-based delivery of the assessment to Practitioners on the Internet and Examiners on the USPTO Intranet.  The software shall support the concurrent delivery of multiple types of tests.  The software shall be able to archive previously delivered tests and activate them for redelivery. The software shall meet Section 508 compliancy requirements.  The software shall run on UNIX, Linux, or AIX and use an Oracle database to store data.  The software shall provide an easy to use interface for question and test creation, including the option to import test questions from a text file. The software shall allow creation of multiple-choice questions with the option to randomize the ordering of questions and answer choices.  The software shall allow the creation of tests having long narratives with embedded questions, as well as the option to include hypertext links to reference material. The software shall provide the capability to customize the look and feel of a test. (For example, the font type and size should be customizable.)  The software shall provide the option to display detailed feedback either after each question is answered or at the end of the test.   The software shall provide a way to group questions into categories.  In a test consisting of questions from multiple categories, the subtotals from each category shall be provided to the test-taker in the test results to show areas that need improvement. The software shall provide the option to set a time limit for the overall test.  The software shall provide the option to set the passing score for a test.  The software shall allow test-takers to self-register. The software shall require test-takers to log in with a user name and password to take a test.  The software shall allow test-takers to resume testing at the place that they left off after a break or unexpected interruption.  The software shall have the option of automatically generating emails to test-takers.  The software shall allow for conditional branching within a test. (For example, test-takers cannot proceed to the next question until the current question is answered correctly.) 

The software shall provide the option to set multiple levels of access privileges for administrator accounts.  The software shall provide the administrator the ability to  restrict access of certain users to  particular tests. The software shall provide pre-built reports or offer a tool to create reports summarizing test results, outcome correlation, and other pertinent information.  

In determining technical capability USPTO may test and technically evaluate the proposed systems based on the following factors: security (data encryption and integrity), proven implementation, ease of maintenance, scalability, performance, high availability, component reusability, and compatibility with USPTO architecture.  Specify if software can integrate with IBM WebSphere.  Include benchmarks for each platform supported, including concurrent user statistics, if available.  Multiple approaches are welcomed.  The technical capability submissions, other than product literature shall not exceed 10 pages.  Ultimate vendor selection will be based upon Best Value as follows: technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida, intends to purchase a fixed wing aircraft for the support of snow survey missions. Aircraft of the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment.  NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world, over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice. These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research. The AOC operates and maintains one Rockwell Turbo Commander aircraft, which is considered the most ideal airplane for conducting snow water equivalency measurements in the high altitude and mountainous areas of the United States.  The Turbo Commander is used to carry a gamma ray spectrometer.  This instrument is necessary to complete the ASnow Survey@ work, and must be mounted in the aircraft fuselage, and calibrated to the airframe.  During the winter months, all of the snow-covered areas of the U.S., including Alaska must be surveyed, making this work extremely time critical.  The agency is interested in purchasing a low-time turbine powered Rockwell Commander.  The aircraft should be available to be operated by the AOC November 1st, 2003.

<CONTACT>Talisa Spottswood, 703-602-3661
<DESC>NA The purpose of this modification is to respond to questions received prior to the Q&A cut-off.  The solicitation response date / closing date and time have not changed. QUESTION:  In Answer 2 of your July 23rd Modification 1 it was stated Ã¢Â€Â˜The software will be installed on the Lotus Domino Server onlyÃ¢Â€Â™.  Our understanding of the requirement is to be able to manage a number of passwords, including those involving  the Lotus suite of products.  The solicitation makes no reference as to what type of server or system the solution must run on.  It seems to us that specifying that it must run on a Lotus server is overly specific and may preclude the government obtaining  the best solution.  A strong argument in terms of security and/or reliability can be made for running a password management system on a different server.  The only real requirement is that it can reliably manage a Lotus environment. ANSWER:  The solicitation specifically states for the product must be ran on a Lotus Domino Server.  No exceptions. QUESTION:  In modification 1, the answer to question 3 states that technical setup and installation is to be included as part of the proposal.  In order to include setup and installation, please provide a statement of work that details this requirement.  F or example; where is the work to be performed, at are the hardware platforms and operating systems (both target and server) that require software to be loaded, what is the timeline for performance, are personnel clearances required, what is the criteria fo r sign-off on completion of work, etc. ANSWER:  Work is to be performed in Arlington, VA.  Hardware Platform:  Dell Server w/Lotus Domino 5.011 installed.  NTE 1 day install & configuration. (Negoitable)  No clearances required.  Sign-off of work will be completed upon verification that the installed software passes the functionality test of the features requested. QUESTION:  What versions of Lotus Domino, iNotes and IBM Lotus Instant Messaging and Web Conferencing (Sametime) and Team WorkPlace (QuickPlace) are deployed at your organization?  ANSWER:  Lotus Domino ver. 5.011 ; INotes - not using ; Sametimes ver. 3.0 SP1 ; QuickPlace - not using QUESTION:  On the server side, what operating system and versions are employed by these software solutions (Lotus Domino, iNotes,Sametime, and Quickplace)?  ANSWER:  Windows 2000 Advanced Server QUESTION:  In Requirement #5a of the RFP, it is stated that the solution must Ã¢Â€Â˜Synchronizes multiple passwords: allow user to synchronize HTTP, NT and LDAP passwords and Notes ID FileÃ¢Â€Â™.    For LDAP, is an LDAP-compliant directory server already deployed, in addition to any existing Lotus Domino directory servers? IF so, what type of LDAP servers have you deployed throughout the organization?  ANSWER:  Using Domino LDAP QUESTION:  In Requirement #5b, it is stated that the solution must provide Ã¢Â€Â˜Plug-ins for Sametime Connect authentication & Domino LDAP authentication.Ã¢Â€Â™  Since a plug-in is a module installed within the browser on the local client computer, this r equirement contradicts the earlier statement that the solution must Ã¢Â€Â˜Requires no client-side softwareÃ¢Â€Â™.  Please clarify.  ANSWER:  No plug-in QUESTION:  In Requirement #5u, it is stated that the solution must Ã¢Â€Â˜Enables self-registration: allows end-users to create their own user accounts without administrator involvement.Ã¢Â€Â™  IS this self-registration requirement specific to just Lotus Do mino, or is it meant to permit the user to create all of their own user accounts across all of the required software systems listed earlier in the RFP (HTTP, NT and LDAP and Notes/Domino)?  If this is the case, this requirement alone seems to provide an in herent security risk and should be re-evaluated as a Ã¢Â€Â˜trueÃ¢Â€Â™ requirment.  ANSWER:  Just in Lotus Notes         QUESTION:  Has your organization performed a market survey of the existing COTS produc ts readily available to provide this solution, and if so, what are the results of that market survey?  ANSWER:  The results of the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s market research are not relevant  QUESTION:  Because the solution is web centric what is the web server that will be used.  ANSWER:  IIS QUESTION:  The requirements list a need to recover passwords without Administrative help. Is the proposed system required to store passwords so that managed systems can be  reconstructed in the event of failure - such as their internal registries failing. ANSWER:  This feature will need to give the user the ability to obtain their password via Ã¢Â€Â˜challenge and answerÃ¢Â€Â™ method or by the user supplying their email address registered with the password database. QUESTION:  What is the geographical dispersion of clients and servers. Different approaches might be taken to solutions that require the use of WANS rather thanLANS.  This also leads to the question of what is the reliability of the network the solution wi ll operate over. ANSWER:  This is not a relevant question.  We want a solution that integrates with Lotus Domino servers. QUESTION:  We would like to know are these web based applications, client server applications, or both? ANSWER:  We are looking for a server side solution that integrates with Lotus Domino and that would require the client to have access to a browser (Microsoft IE 5.0). QUESTION:  Item # 3 of things that the 'Password Management Tool' 'MUST DO' reads; Ã¢Â€Â˜Requires no client-side softwareÃ¢Â€Â™.  We find this statement to be somewhat ambiguous.  Does this mean that once the Password Management Tool is in place, the clien t 'Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W)' has a requirement involving not having any software to utilize the Password Management Tool 'OR' does it mean that 'Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W)' won't accept a Passord Management Tool th at is 'installed' from vendor software?  ANSWER:  The software will be installed on the Lotus Domino Server only.  There will be no installation of software required on the client PCs. QUESTION:  While the combined solicitation does mention a potential requirement of 12,500 seats, it does not mention any possible ordering/delivery schedule.  The combined solicitation also leaves open the area of technical set-up/installation.  Is this no t to be part of the Technical Proposal or the Cost Proposal? ANSWER:  The 12500 licenses will be included with the installation of the server side software - no separate delivery date.  Technical setup and installation should be included in the contract.

UPDATE (21 Jul 03): The site visit date of 24 Jul 2003 will be rescheduled for  a later date.  A formal amendment will be posted ASAP.  The deadline to respond  to the site visit will be adjusted as well. Project Number 960703: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10834 (Base) Project Number 960704: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10835 (Option I) Project Number 960705: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10836 (Option II) Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0050. The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the replacement of the fan coil units,  heating/cooling water system, windows, and roof in Facilities 10834, 10835, and  10836.  The scope will also include associated architectural, mechanical,  plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as shown on the project drawings  and described in the specifications.  The estimated price range is  between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $12M.   This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration.: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: This project involves  the Visitor Quarters (VQ), which houses military and  civilian personnel of all levels, including VIPs on  Temporary Duty at WPAFB for numerous official Air Force  activities.  This project is in an extremely high  visibility area, due to the number of visiting individuals  housed at any one time, and will receive an unusually high  level of scrutiny.  This project will be subject to a very  tight construction schedule.  The project is in phases, and  involves work in each room.  This work will require close  coordination between disciplines, and close supervision by  the contractor in order to minimize the number of  unavailable rooms at any one time.  The work must be  accomplished so that the remaining occupied units will not  be impacted, nor the personnel housed in them  inconvenienced.  The requirement to supervise and  coordinate the work in all of the rooms contained in the  VQ will present the contractor with a difficult  construction management challenge.  Failure to supervise  and coordinate the different trades required to provide a  quality and timely product will not be acceptable.   Performance is critical to minimize disruption to WPAFB  activities.  The liquidated damages associated with not  meeting the contractual period of performance will be high  due to the cost of housing Air Force personnel off base if  the rooms are not available on schedule. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 14 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W.  Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. (5) A registration page will be attached to the website.  You are not required  to register.  Howeverm when you register you will receive notice of any  amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total proposed  amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.  If an option is exercised after award,  contractors shall be responsible for securing the additional bonding equal to  the amount of the option. (7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing date  specified in the solicitation.  There will not be a public bid opening. (8) Contractors that are Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment are  excluded from receiving contracts.  Agencies also shall not consent to  subcontract with such contractors.  Proposals prepared by Debarred, Suspended,  or otherwise ineligible contractors are at the risk and expense of the  contractor.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support and operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (ii) commercial practices.  Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

<CONTACT>Carol Elliott, Contracting Officer, 803-952-9280, carol.elliott@srs.gov;Donna Anderson, Contract Specialist, 803-952-9252, donna.anderson@srs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR) will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the construction of the Glass Waste Storage Building (GWSB) #2 on, or after, August 11, 2003. The RFP is in support of the DOE Environmental Management mission.  High Level Waste (HLW) is currently stored in tank farms at the Savannah River Site (SRS).  The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) vitrifies the HLW, and seals it in stainless steel canisters.  The canisters are then transported to a GWSB for interim storage until it can be permanently transferred to the Federal repository.  The first GWSB is nearing capacity and a second GWSB is required to continue to meet DWPF?s storage requirements. The procurement will be set-aside for small businesses in accordance with FAR 19.5. This acquisition is classified as North American Industry Classification (NAIC) #237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.  The size standard under this NAIC is $28.5 million.  In accordance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the small business prime contractor must perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees. The GWSB #2 will be a below-grade structure (approximately 30 feet) with a footprint of approximately 210 feet by 210 feet.  It will consist of four vaults and store capacity of 2,340 canisters.  The canisters are approximately 10 feet in height and 2 feet in diameter.  The vault walls support the grade level floor.  The floor must support the weight of the 235,000-pound Shielded Canister Transport (SCT) and large plugs that provide radiological shielding of the canisters.  The SCT removes the plugs, inserts the canisters through the openings in the floor, and replaces the plugs.  Each canister is expected to radiate 5,000 rem per hour and can generate 1,000 watts of heat that must be removed by a ventilation system. An above grade superstructure spans the entire width and length of the storage facility with no supporting columns except around the perimeter.  This structure protects the vaults from adverse weather.  An electrical room, containing HVAC, ventilation and monitoring systems is attached to the above grade superstructure.  The solicitation also covers the construction of an access road capable of supporting the SCT and connecting GWSB #1 and GWSB #2. The GWSB vaults and canister supports must be constructed to meet DOE nuclear design ?safety class? requirements.  This is necessary to protect the public, the environment, and facility workers from unacceptable radiation exposure in the event of structurally significant natural phenomena such as tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.  The above grade superstructure is not a safety-related structure. The source selection will be conducted under FAR 15 procedures for a negotiated contract. The GWSB #1 design is currently being updated to meet changes in codes and standards.  The updated design will not be completed until November 2003.  Since DOE anticipates no cardinal changes between GWSB #1 design and the GWSB #2 design, the solicitation is being issued with the GWSB #1 design. When the final design is complete, the solicitation will be revised to incorporate the updated design.  Offerors that are still being considered for award will be given an opportunity to revise proposals based on the updated design. The estimated value of the resulting contract is $40-$60 million. Selection of the successful construction firm will be based on the offer that represents the best value to the government.  Proposals will be due 45 days from the release of the solicitation.  Contract award is anticipated late December, 2003/early January 2004.  Construction and system testing must be completed no later than February 28, 2006. This RFP will be released electronically.  Hard copies will only be mailed upon request.  The RFP and all supporting documents will be available on a secured, password protected, website.  Interested Offerors may obtain a password to access the website and obtain the RFP by submitting a written request to Ms. Donna Anderson, either at the address for submission of proposals or by facsimile to 803-952-9452.  The following information is required when requesting a password for the website:  (1) Name of the Company and Location of Incorporation; (2) A statement of whether the company foreign owned or controlled ? If yes, provide the name(s) of foreign country(ies); (3) Name of Requestor/Individual; (4) Citizenship of Requestor; (5) Address; (6) Phone Number; (7) Fascimile Number; (8) email address.  The password will be provided to you by return facsimile or email.

<DESC>Notice of Intent.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type Contract for the procurement of AN/FPN-64 Transmitter Controller Systems for a period of (5) five years to Megapulse, Inc., 101 Billerica Ave., 4 Billerica Business Center, N. Billerica, MA  01862.  The United States Coast Guard is the world’s pioneer and specialist in the Long Range Navigation (LORAN) System.  The responsibility for LORAN operations was transferred from the Department of Defense to the Coast Guard in 1974.  The Coast Guard operates and maintains the U.S. LORAN System to meet the needs of air, land, and marine navigators, as well as precise time and time interval users.  The 1999 Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP) announced that the government would continue to operate LORAN in the short term, while the administration evaluates the long-term need.  To ensure continued operability, to gain efficiencies of operation and support, and to improve the technical capabilities of the LORAN system, the Coast Guard is considering the initiation of a contract for a minimum quantity of 2 and a maximum quantity of 17 AN/FPN-64 Transmitter Controller Systems, manufactured by Megapulse, Inc., N. Billerica, MA.  01862.  The purpose of this market survey announcement is to solicit interest from industry that offers a commercial model to meet the requirement to replace the existing 1970’s vintage SSX Transmitter Operational Controllers (TOPCO).  No specifications, schematics or drawings are available due to limited rights of technical data.  The new Transmitter Controller System must be a fit, form and functional replacement for the existing TOPCO, with additional functionalities, such as complete remote control capability, autonomous transmitter operation, autonomous control of redundant functionalities, transmitted signal analysis and report capability, and full event, alarm and fault logging capability.  Due to critical, safety of life and property, nature of Loran-C transmissions, installation work that interrupts those transmissions must be accomplished efficiently, under strict pre-arranged schedule and time constraints.  Under this request for information, all responsible sources are encouraged to submit a capability statement that sufficiently demonstrates qualifications, capabilities, facilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement, in total, or in part.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal.  There will not be a contract award as a result of this request for information.  Responses to this announcement should be submitted, in writing, not later than 08AUG03 to the attention of Mrs. Catherine Baskin at the address stated above.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support and operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (ii) commercial practices.  Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

The proposed services relate software defined radio initiatives: emphasizing the resolution of issues with respect to communication systems interoperability, integration, networking and design, engineering and licensing. The following areas of expertise are required: experience in the study, analysis, design, testing and implementation of integrated communications systems; communications networking; radio systems engineering and licensing; public safety domain interfacing; working knowledge of legal statutes and intellectual property agreements; familiarity of software radio system utilization, as well as: federal, state, and local public safety industry knowledge and interaction. Experience in Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulatory issues. The software-defined architecture provides flexibility in handling multiple waveforms and communications systems. SAAC links disparate inter-agency systems in both frequency and waveform types.  This solution is software driven; therefore, the configuration control can be easily altered. Upgrades require adding software modules to the existing system; providing backward compatibility to currently fielded systems.   The SAAC system can also act as a repeater for extending the normal range of radios. SAAC combines various Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies and subsystems onto a single card to develop a solution with the same form factor as full length Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) cards in standard desktop workstations. The contractor shall provide software defined radio systems engineering, integration and technical services for the SAAC System.  Experience in the following areas, at a minimum, is required:  demonstrable understanding of the SAAC architecture, software designed radio installation; software based wireless communication systems, software defined radio system integration, radio infrastructure, interoperable voice and data communications, mobile computing, system deployment, emergency incident support and operational system planning. It is imperative to have experience with South Carolina Public Safety radio systems and networks and proficiency in the integration of legacy Public Safety communication infrastructure. Installation of a SAAC system requires the following tasking:  procurement and delivery of SAAC production unit(s), site survey visitation, documentation and review plan. Also, analysis of specific requirements for systems integration; including, as required: hardware, software, communications, physical interfaces, video, data, and user interfaces.  An implementation plan shall be designed and delivered to the government for approval prior to installation. Project Management required to successfully and efficiency complete all tasking shall be required.  This includes, at a minimum: project status updates, financial and contractual documents and other tasks as specified by each delivery order. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract is anticipated with a base period of one year and options to extend the term of the contract for an additional two (2) one-year periods. The NAICS Code is 541330 and the applicable size standard is $ 23 Million. NO SOLICITATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Any firm that believes it can meet the requirement may give written notification to the individual identified below.

<SUBJECT>R -- Disbursing Services
<DESC>RFI-ASD-Disbursing-Services.  
The establishment of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in January 1991 was an important first step in the continuing process to improve the Department of Defense (DoD) finance and accounting operations.  Prior to DFAS, DoD performed finance and accounting functions at various installations/activities using non-standard systems and procedures.   Over the years DFAS consolidated from 338 offices to 26, reduced manpower by 9,200 positions, reduced systems from 324 to 65, reorganized into business line structure, and received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002.  
On September 10, 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the DoD would begin examination and review of the Defense Agencies to determine if functions or processes could be improved.  This announcement led to the development of a DFAS Transformation Strategy.  DFAS is currently developing a Transformation Strategy for Disbursing.
	DFAS consists of three major business lines, one being Accounting Services.  Under the ¡§umbrella¡¨ of Accounting Services is the Disbursing function.  Disbursing is responsible for the payment and collection of funds, whether by electronic transmission or hard checks, bond maintenance, balancing payments, bank account maintenance, etc.
 	This Request for Information (RFI) fact sheet provides an overview of Disbursing as performed by DFAS.  It is not a solicitation for services.  It is only a market survey approach to determine whether the market contains the capability to perform the functions described.  No decision has been to pursue any kind of private-sector commercial involvement.  
OVERVIEW OF DISBURSING FUNCTIONS:
Disbursing is a function under the Accounting Business Line.  Disbursing is charged with safeguarding U.S. funds through delivery of payments and receipt of collections; providing prompt, accurate and timely disbursing services, and reporting accountability to the Department of Treasury.  The process of entitling payments occurs outside Disbursing and where automated uses multiple systems.  The support of these various systems and interfaces resides with a number of DoD entities.  It should be noted that expenditure accounting data flows through the disbursing process to the appropriate accounting activities.
Disbursing, within DFAS, is primarily performed under a centralized concept at five DFAS sites located at Cleveland, Columbus, Denver, Indianapolis, and Kansas City.  In addition DFAS Disbursing is performed at DFAS locations in Europe and the Far East.  Additional DFAS Disbursing operations are also performed at a large number of military installations and deployed locations worldwide by service personnel acting in the name of the DFAS Disbursing officers.  Efforts are underway to reduce the number of primary sites at which DFAS Disbursing is performed.  Outside of the 5 DFAS sites providing actual disbursing services, is a DFAS-Arlington operation located at DFAS-Kansas City, the Financial Services and Disbursing Division.    
While legacy systems are primarily used to support disbursing operations, there are several manual and automated work-around processes within Disbursing Offices.  Although some of these functions may be small in count, the manual labor to perform these processes result in expending many man-hours to support the work.  
There are 3 primary Disbursing systems used within DFAS, (e.g., Automated Disbursing System (ADS), Centralized Disbursing System (CDS), Standard Finance System Redesign  Phase 1 (SRD1), as well as, several entitlement systems with embedded disbursing functions.   While the three aforementioned systems are used to support Disbursing throughout DFAS, efforts are underway to reduce the number of systems being used and consolidate to a selected system(s).
The major functions of Disbursing are:
„h Disbursements: DFAS disburses using a wide variety of currencies and payment mechanisms.  Additionally, it processes high volume payrolls, intermediate volume daily cycles, and low volume special/emergency payments.  Disbursement mechanisms include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury checks, direct Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) feeds into the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) network, multiple currency wire transfers, multiple currency and host nations bank accounts for check and EFT, cash, debit and stored value cards, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs,) travelers checks, and precious metals.  Primary to the function of disbursements is the printing and sorting/stuffing of checks, bonds, advice of payments and vouchers, and control over securing government instruments.  This includes special handling requirements as well as daily and periodic payroll runs, maintenance of blank bonds and checks, control of supplies, and maintenance of equipment.  DFAS also processes Automated Clearing House (ACH) credits and Federal Taxes.  In addition, DFAS is responsible for the maintenance of bonds for safekeeping.
„h Collections and Deposits: DFAS collection processes support retail activities; telephone and utility services; hospitals; debt collections; deposits to savings programs; surety escrows; and various miscellaneous processes.  Collections are received in both U.S. and foreign currencies by EFT, wire, negotiable instruments, credit card, debit card, cash, and food stamps.  There is no standard accounts receivable system.  Deposits are made both directly to the FRB and through the U.S. Treasury general accounts held at contract banks.  This function also includes processing returned negotiable instruments with collection reversal actions or debt collection, as appropriate.
„h Transfers:  DFAS manages over 200 appropriations.  Transactions between the appropriations, between accounting offices within DoD, or with other government agencies normally flow through disbursing even when a physical payment is not processed external to the government.  A primary system used for transfers is the Intra-governmental Payment and Collection  (IPAC) operated by the U.S. Treasury.  Payment and collection data for transfer transactions is captured and distributed to accounting offices by disbursing for subsequent reporting to the U.S. Treasury. 
„h Network Operations/Accountability: DFAS disbursing activities support extensive worldwide networks of satellite activities performing specialized missions (classified and unclassified) ranging from paying foreign armies to occasional emergency payments.  These operations are both on-line and manual.  Processed payments and collections must be centrally recorded, balanced, and distributed to appropriate accounting and entitlement systems.  DFAS disbursing provides procedures, systems support, and oversight for these Service operations.
„h Expenditure Balancing/Accounting: Unlike the U.S. Treasury operations, the majority of DFAS disbursing activities process lines of accounting data with the actual disbursement and collections transactions.  This accounting data is then passed to the appropriate accounting systems, and ultimately the U.S. Treasury, along with the disbursing generated payment information.  This requires disbursing activities to balance payment and collection data to distributed accounting charges.   DFAS disbursing activities are also responsible for maintaining accountability for funds held outside Treasury, as well as, Suspense Account Management, which involves researching, tracking, aging, clearing and reporting non-exempt transactions for suspense accounts directly related to the Disbursing Officers Disbursing Station Symbol Number (DSSN).
„h Returns/Recalls: DFAS disbursing activities process all check, EFT, and wire returns and recalls.  These processes are automated to varying degrees dependent on the disbursing and entitlement systems involved.  DFAS disbursing also processes Treasury Check Claims, which involve inquiries based on non-receipt of checks and stale dated checks.
„h Systems: Systems development and support (e.g., Standard Finance System Redesign phase 1 (SRD1), Automated Disbursing System (ADS), Centralized Disbursing System (CDS), Defense Standard Disbursing System (DSDS), Deployed Disbursing System (DDS), etc.), providing the means used to accomplish payment/collections, transmitting, analyzing, recording and reporting disbursing transactions.  Includes local (non-Technical Services Organization (TSO) disbursing system support functions (i.e., access control, trouble shooting, scheduling).  Also includes the Central Contractor Registration/Central Electronic Funds Transfer (CCR/CEFT) system for the DoD.
„h Financial Services and Disbursing: Financial Services and Disbursing functions involve responding to procedural inquiries across all DFAS and military networks, writing new guidance and maintaining the DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 5, determining and processing requests for waivers for lost funds, analyzing and evaluating new legislative and regulatory requirements from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Treasury, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the DoD, and establish/disestablish DSSNs for all DoD disbursing offices to include requests for new DSSNs and the deactivation/closure of DSSNs at the Department of Treasury.
„h Customer Service/Support:  DFAS disbursing is responsible for handling inquiries with financial institutions, as well as, payee requests for status of payments.
The following information is provided to outline Disbursing Services performed at each of the five major DFAS locations, to include the services provided and systems used.
DFAS-Indianapolis Disbursing Services:  Disbursing support for the Army, 16 Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, and three joint commands is centralized at DFAS Indianapolis.  In addition, Indianapolis has two small disbursing satellites operated by DFAS Europe and DFAS Japan, primarily for foreign currency operations.  DFAS Indianapolis centrally processes 99% of its disbursements; however, it also supports a worldwide network of both garrison and deployed deputy operations at over 50 locations using cash, local bank accounts and/or U.S. Treasury checks. Multiple logistics and accounting systems also feed appropriation transfer transactions into disbursing.  Collections are primarily input by customer activities (93%) at every Army and DoD agency location and then centrally reconciled to banking deposit records and processed in Indianapolis.  All expenditure data for 165 accounting stations, using eight different accounting systems, is centrally processed and distributed.  DFAS Indianapolis also feeds data to departmental accounting, the U.S. Treasury, and a variety of DFAS support systems providing real time information to customers.  There are two additional DFAS disbursing activities within the Indianapolis accounting network:  Transportation payments, which operates a unique version of SRD1 in conjunction with the Defense Transportation Payments System, and a small activity at Denver which primarily transfers funds between Army training activities and Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  In addition to DFAS disbursing operations, the Army operates a number of separate disbursing activities primarily for certain deployed operations, local cashier services (check cashing, foreign currency exchange) outside the United States, and for the Corps of Engineers.  The Corps of Engineers operates its own centralized disbursing at Millington, Tennessee.  Disbursing is done using the Corps of Engineers Financial Management System (CEFMS), an integrated accounting, finance and project management system.  Army tactical finance elements in Kuwait, Bosnia, Korea, and Western Europe operate separate disbursing stations performing a limited range of disbursing functions.  There are also two small disbursing stations with the National Security Agency and Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which are currently being considered for centralization into DFAS Indianapolis.
Systems Used:  DFAS Indianapolis processes disbursements and collections using three disbursing systems (e.g., Standard Finance System Redesign phase I is an IBM mainframe based system which comprises 7 databases supporting 9,000 users; Disbursing Office Processing System (DOPS), which is a DOS PC/server based system and comprises 2 databases; and Single Negotiable Instruments Processing System (SNIPS) which is a UNISYS mainframe based system, as well as an Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) disbursing module in the Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS), another IBM mainframe based system.  A middle-ware data integrator/distributor, Operational Data Store (ODS), is an Oracle midtier based system and is also used along with a variety of support systems.  Incoming automated Requests for Payment (RfPs) come from over 150 entitlement activities using 12 different systems.  Multiple logistics and accounting systems also feed appropriation transfer transactions into disbursing. 
DFAS-Cleveland Disbursing Services:  Disbursing services for the Navy active and reserve military members and Navy travelers are performed at DFAS-Cleveland.  In addition to the Navy, disbursing services are performed for all DoD military retirees and annuitants, all DoD civilians, vendors, and such non-DoD agencies as Department of Energy, Health and Human Services, and the Veterans Administration.  Due to the majority of disbursing work being ¡§payroll related¡¨, there is extensive balancing and reporting to a number of federal agencies.  The DFAS-Cleveland disbursing organization includes several geographically separate Deputy Disbursing Officers in Japan, Hawaii, Pensacola, Charleston, San Diego, and Norfolk.  However, 99.99% of disbursements and collections are made at the central site in Cleveland.  All payment and collection activity is reconciled and reported to Treasury monthly.
Systems Used:  The Automated Disbursement System (ADS) is used throughout the DFAS-Cleveland network.  Subject to strict security, over 3,000 DoD and Federal users worldwide access payment information within ADS.  
DFAS-Denver Disbursing Services:  Disbursing services for the Air Force is centralized at DFAS-Denver, with the exception of the Secretary of the Air Force/Financial Management (SAF/FM).  They are a separate entity, falling under their own Disbursing Station Symbol Number (DSSN) of 6599.  All other Air Force activities fall under DSSN 3801.  The DFAS-Denver office includes Deputy Disbursing Officers (DDOs) at 11 field sites and 104 Air Force bases, located worldwide.  While the disbursing assets at the field sites are DFAS positions, the DDOs at the Air Force bases are Air Force positions.  They operate in the name of the DFAS-Denver Disbursing Officer, who make local payments via EFT, check or cash, collect and deposit funds locally, or to a Federal Reserve Bank, and report their accountability to the Denver Central site on a daily basis.  There are 294 Deputy Disbursing Officers at these locations.
Systems Used:  The Centralized Disbursing System (CDS) is the only disbursing system that DFAS Denver (DSSN 3801) uses to support the Air Force.  It consists of only one database that all locations feed into.  There are however, several systems that disbursing utilizes to accomplish the mission.  The primary one is the Defense Check Reconciliation Module (DCRM).
DFAS-Kansas City Disbursing Services:  Disbursing services for the Marine Corps are centralized at DFAS-Kansas City for all non-tactical elements, with the exception of disbursing performed in Japan and Europe.  The DFAS-Kansas City office also includes Deputy Disbursing Officers and functions located at 19 Marine Corps bases/stations in the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Japan and Okinawa.  These remote Deputies are United States Marine Corps (USMC) personnel, operating in the name of the DFAS-Kansas City Disbursing Officer, who make local payments via check or cash, collect and deposit funds locally, and report their accountability to the central site on a daily basis.  Within the Marine Corps are 3 tactical elements (Force Service Support Groups (FSSG)) that operate at Camp Lejeune, NC, Camp Pendleton, CA, and Okinawa, Japan.  These elements hold separate and distinct Disbursing Station Symbol Numbers (DSSNs) and disburse all levels of payments for tactical forces whether in garrison or deployed.  Each of the individual FSSGs also maintains several inactive DSSNs which may be activated for short term deployments by smaller units.  All disbursing business is reported to DFAS Kansas City for roll-up and reporting to Treasury.  
Systems Used:  The current systems used to support Marine Corps disbursements (non-tactical and tactical) are SRD1 for vendor, travel, miscellaneous payroll, and other miscellaneous payments; Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS), which is a military pay entitlement system with a disbursing module for scheduled payrolls and allotments; and Transportation Management System (TMS) for transportation and Do-It-Yourself (DITY) move payments.  SRD1 receives data via interfaces from the accounting system and several entitlement systems, the Intra-governmental Payment and Collection System (IPAC) for Intra-governmental payments.  Expenditure data is passed via interfaces to the accounting system, Defense Check Reconciliation Module (DCRM) for check issue data, and to IPAC-Wizard.  It must be noted that the versions of SRD1 used by DFAS-Kansas City are not identical to those used by DFAS-Indianapolis or DFAS-Columbus.
DFAS COLUMBUS Disbursing Services:  DFAS Columbus Disbursing is centralized and has no agent operations.  DFAS Columbus supports various Defense Agency disbursement and collection functions.  Disbursing is reported using 11 Disbursing Station Symbol Numbers (DSSNs) and is rolled-up at departmental level/ Defense Agency DSSN, which there are 2; Army DSSN, which there are 3 at DFAS Indianapolis; Air Force DSSN which there are 3 at DFAS Denver; and Navy DSSN, which there are 3 at DFAS Cleveland.  Disbursements are provided by a variety of systems, while collections are performed for all Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) CONUS and Far East commissaries, DRMS CONUS and OCONUS, EFT rejects, returned checks and miscellaneous check collections.  All collections are performed manually.
Disbursing Systems:  DFAS Columbus uses 7 different disbursing systems.  Six of those systems are entitlement systems with embedded disbursing modules:  1)  Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), which uses 3 subsystems to perform disbursements; 2)  Standard Automated Material Management System (SAMMS); 3) Business System Modernization (BSM); 4)  Fuels Automated System (FAS); 5)  Defense Integrated Substance Management System (DISMS); and 6)  Automated Voucher and Examination and Disbursement System (AVEDS).  These 6 systems support the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA); Defense Logistics Agency (DLA); and the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).  The seventh system, SRD1, provides disbursing support for various entitlements (e.g., vendor pay, travel pay, etc.).   DFAS Columbus as the serves as the Program Manager for  Central Electronic Fund Transfer (CEFT),  the centralized repository for all the Department of Defense (DoD) banking information.  Functions performed are registration for system access,  deletes and resets for CEFT system for  approximately 2000 DoD users.  Columbus serves as the focal point for all DoD problem issues. They create trouble tickets via Remedy and reconcile discrepancies between Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and CEFT.
DFAS Financial Services and Disbursing Division:  The DFAS Financial Services and Disbursing Division, located at DFAS-KC is a DFAS-Arlington element that is responsible for providing all disbursing oversight and management to the Department of Defense (DoD) and DFAS disbursing officers.  This Division is also responsible for developing and promulgating standard DoD disbursing guidance and procedures, for maintaining DoD disbursing manuals, regulations and instructions, and for providing assistance and problem resolutions on all DoD disbursing matters.  The Financial Services and Disbursing Division develops and implements efficient and cost effective policies, procedures, techniques, mechanisms and practices to improve cash management in the DoD, in addition for providing operations management and analysis to DoD disbursing offices, including DSSN management/ordering U.S. Treasury checks, providing management oversight and appropriate actions to resolve discrepancies in Disbursing Officers accountability to include losses of funds and dishonored checks throughout the DoD. 
Transactions Processed:  All information is based on fiscal year 2002.  DFAS disbursing processed a total of:  1)  Approximately 167M disbursements totaling $318.9B.  Of this amount, 109M transactions for $241.8B were EFT; 34.8M transactions for $12.8B were Check, 549K transactions for $28.2B were IPAC and 6K transactions for $8.7M were ¡§other¡¨, which includes cash, wire transfers, etc.  2)  Approximately 1.5M collections for $82.4B. 3)  Printing approximately 7.2M Advice of Payment (AOP) vouchers; 4) Approximately 3.3M Appropriation Transfers; 5)  Responded to approximately 102K inquiries; 6) Processed approximately 316K Returns/Recalls; and 7)  Maintained an on-hand balance of approximately $597.2M.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 5114-3-0019 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Midwest Area, Soil and Water Unit, St. Paul, MN, has a requirement/need  for a Trace Gas Analyzer "Brand Name or Equal" to Campbell Scientific’s Model TGA100 Trace Gas Analyzer.  Listed are the description of  items and quantities required: CLIN No. 1 - Model TGA100, Trace Gas Analyzer (1 unit); CLIN No. 2 -  Laser Dewar (1 unit); CLIN No. 3 - Laser Tunable for N20 (1 unit); CLIN No. 4 - Temperature Controller (1 unit); CLIN No. 5 - Gas Connector (1 unit); CLIN No. 6 - Evacuation Valve Operator (1 unit); CLIN No. 7 - Fiber Optic Interconnect Cable (1 Unit); CLIN No. 8 - Outdoor Fiber Optic (35 feet); CLIN No. 9 - Enclosure Insulated Cover (1 unit); CLIN No. 10 -  Sample Pump (1 unit); CLIN No. 11 - Suction Hose (PVC) (50 feet); and CLIN No. 12 - Sample Air Dryer (1 unit).  The analyzer will be used to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields.  N2O is a potent greenhouse gas, nearly 300 times more effective than CO2 in absorbing infrared radiation and contributing to global warming.  The mean atmospheric concentration is increasing rapidly, in large part due to denitrification of fertilizers applied by farmers.  We are attempting to develop new farming practices that will help reduce global warming by storing CO2 and reducing N2O;  to do that we need to measure the exchange of those gases between the surface and the atmosphere with considerable accuracy, and we need to do it under different management scenarios to compare their efficacy in reducing N2O emissions.   THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the Trace Gas Analyzer System must meet or include these minimum requirements: (1) Must be a continuous flow-through system, with measurements made at a rate of at least 10 Hz.  (2) Must be designed for field use, rather than laboratory use with weatherproof enclosure, capability of being set up in an agricultural field, and powered by a portable generator.  (3) Must be Portable.  It must be possible to move the system from one site to another, set it up, and restart measurements within a 2-3 hour period, without extensive realignments or adjustments.  (4) Must have low power consumption of less than 800 W.  (5) Resolution.  In order to measure expected fluxes with acceptable accuracy, the instrument must be able to resolve a gradient in N2O (difference in concentration between two intakes) of 2 ppbv or better.  (6) Proven performance.  There must be proof (scientific manuscript or equivalent) that the instrument has been successfully used for measuring field-scale N2O fluxes.  (7) Input/output flexibility.  The instrument must be PC-compatible, but must also be capable of providing output signals to a datalogger and to control sampling valves.  (8) Complete system - System must include all components necessary to make concentration measurements, including pump, dryer (if needed), cryogenic cooler (if needed), software, valves, relays, etc.  Specific exceptions: calibration gases, sample line tubing, computer.  (9) Must include Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy.  (10) Must include installation and provide training on operation during instrument installation.  DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE:  Offerors shall submit 2 copies of the Descriptive Literature describing their proposed equipment in enough detail to ascertain whether the equipment meets the criteria listed above.  REJECTION OF QUOTATION:  Failure to demonstrate compliance will be cause to reject the quotation without further discussions.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.
