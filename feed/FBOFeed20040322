<DESC>The National Library Medicine (NLM) in conjunction with the Fogarty International Center (FIC) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Council of Science Editors (CSE) to procure professional services to support a pilot project to build capacity of four medical journals in Sub-Sahara Africa.  The pilot project will assist the journal editors in improving the quality and content of their journals by upgrading technology and software, implementing mentor relationships with designated northern hemisphere journals, developing more efficient and cost-effective business practices and improving editorial expertise.  A primary goal of such capacity-building efforts is to enable three of the journals to eventually be accepted into MEDLINE.  The four African journals were selected on the basis of active NIH research investments in their countries.

     In order to administer the pilot project efficiently, the CSE will provide the necessary administrative support to facilitate the partnerships between northern and Sub-Saharan journal editors and coordinate logistics and budgeting.  CSE, an international non-profit, membership organization founded in 1957, is dedicated to promoting excellence in the communication of scientific information.  CSE has thorough knowledge of the needs of medical journals, having conducted numerous training programs for editorial staff and reviewers, fostered dialogue via its online forum, and having held an annual meeting at which members can interact with editors from around the world.  In addition, CSE periodically hosts retreats on timely topics of interest to scientific journal editors and provides information and guidance to its members and the general public via its bi-monthly journal – Science Editor, and the publication of guidelines, editorial policy statements and books.      

The proposed services will be procured under FAR Part 12 (Commercial Items). The Period of Performance is anticipated to be for a base year period of May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005, and two additional one-year options.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  Responses are required within fifteen calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04 – 102/KS shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Kala Shankar, Contract Specialist (301/496-6546)

The proposed project will provide research support in several areas including cell culture and virology, immunology, protein biochemistry, and molecular biology.  All these areas are critical to thorough study of retroviral pathogenesis and evaluation of candidate vaccines.   A culture capability will provide for virus isolation and characterization, and development and expansion of viral stocks, critical for assessment of infection following challenge of vaccinated animals with live viruses, for studies of viral variation and evolution, for identification of novel viruses, and for provision of essential viral strains for use in vitro and in vivo. An immunologic capability will provide support in evaluating seroprevalence of viruses of interest and immune responses elicited by candidate vaccines, and in determining immune parameters associated with protection from viral infection or disease progression.  A virologic capability will provide support for pathogenesis studies and for determination of vaccine efficacy following challenge of immunized animals.  Numerous purified proteins and peptides are required in the study of retroviruses and retroviral vaccines, and these will be provided by the protein biochemistry segment of the contract.  Molecular biologic capabilities will provide quantitative analytical support of vaccine and pathogenesis studies as well as direct provision of critical nucleic acid reagents.

<SUBJECT>R -- Support for Clinical Research Infrastruture in South Africa
<SOLNBR>NIAID-OCR-04-65
<CONTACT>Terrie Nestor, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-6790, Fax 301-480-0689, Email tnestor@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a sole source requirement for the continuing support of a clinical research infrastructure in South Africa.  NIAID intends to award a five year contract beginning on or about June 23, 2004 to The Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HJF) on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1.  The HJF is the only responsible source for this requirement.  They have been a critical contributor in establishing the research infrastructure for project “PHIDISA” in South Africa.  Currently, two clinical research protocols have been implemented in two sites in South Africa (one urban and one rural).  Plans are underway for the addition of two rural and two urban sites to bring the total number of sites to six.  It is necessary to retain the services of the same contractor for the successful continuance of this project.  The HJF has established a solid relationship with the US Embassy in South Africa which has provided and will continue to provide PHIDISA with a great number of services.  The HJF has established a solid relationship with the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), which serves as the South African collaborator for the project.  They have experience in dealing with the SANDF policies and impediments regarding acquisitions, contracting, hiring, job requirements and expectations.  They have developed strong working relationships and a mutual sense of trust with high-ranking SANDF military members.  The HJF has experience in dealing with South African laws and regulations which help or hinder clinical trials such as PHIDISA.  They have also been successful in moving the project forward while functioning within the politically charged climate in South Africa, including dealing with the political sensitivities surrounding SANDF practices, HIV and AIDS and the South African government.  The HJF has established an effective business presence in South Africa including banking, offices, legal and commercial bona fides/assurances of good faith.  They have built a strong collaborative relationship with the South African Military Health Service (SAMHS) as well as US-based PHIDISA collaborators.  They have established many and varied contacts/relationships with South African vendors/service providers.  The HJF has established more than 100 contracts to provide transportation, equipment and supplies to initialize and sustain the PHIDISA program and have established information systems/communications design and infrastructure tailored to the South African telecommunications environment and to the PHIDISA mission.  It has taken over nine months of diligent, persistent effort by the HJF, the SANDF, the US DoD, and the NIH to lift this project to the level which it currently operates.  The time and resources that would be required for another firm to develop these types of relationships and skills would be prohibitive to the efficient continuation of this program.  It would be detrimental to the project and, most importantly, potentially harmful to the lives of the patients enrolled in the ongoing PHIDISA studies to entertain other offerors at this critical stage of the project.  For these reasons NIAID believes that no offeror can fulfill the existing needs for the support of the clinical research infrastructure in South Africa.  Please refer any questions in writing to Terrie Nestor at tnestor@niaid.nih.gov on or before May 6, 2004 at 2:00pm EDT.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for conducting a workshop in conjunction with the Radiation Research Society’s annual meeting, capitalizing on this large gathering of radiation researchers and students.The Space Radiation Health Project is responsible for implementing NASA’s strategic plan in the area of radiation health, increasing our understanding of space radiation exposure risks and our ability to develop mitigation strategies for human space radiation protection.  To achieve the goal of establishing acceptable radiation exposure limits for space travel beyond Low Earth orbit, JSC must rely on the external research community.  To attract new investigators and educate existing investigators on the NASA Space Radiation Program, NASA is proposing to hold workshops and summer school programs geared at providing young investigators and graduate students an opportunity to learn about NASA’s Space Radiation Research Program and facilities for conducting space radiation research. The Radiation Research Society has a 50-year historic commitment to education and the fostering and dissemination of knowledge in the radiation sciences.  This experience and the ability of the Society to maximize accessibility to the greatest number of participants by adding to their annual meeting gives them the unique qualifications required to successfully complete this workshop. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 30, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of water and wastewater infrastructure systems at the Fort Meade Army Installation, Maryland.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s)will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

POTABLE WATER SYSTEM
The Ft. Meade potable water utility system includes six groundwater wells, a low-lift pumping station, two high lift pump stations, a water treatment plant, three clear wells, one booster station, four elevated storage tanks, three ground storage tanks, and a potable water distribution system containing approximately 90 miles of pipe.  The raw water supply sources include both surface water and groundwater. The Installation’s primary source of water is the surface water from the Little Patuxent River, which provides approximately 80 percent of water used at FT. MEADE. The other raw water source, which provided the remaining 20 percent of the Installation’s raw water requirements, is groundwater pumped from wells.
 The Low Lift Pump Station (LLPS) adjacent to the river houses three electric pumps total combined capacity rated at 13.4 MGD (9,300 GPM). The well field draws from a confined aquifer at depths of 400’ – 785’ below ground level and has an aggregate capacity of 8.28 MGD (5750 GPM).  The raw water is pumped from the LLPS through three 12-inch diameter water mains, approximately 4,000 feet long, to the water treatment plant. Groundwater pumped from wells, with a combined total capacity of 5750 GPM. The groundwater is pumped to the water treatment plant through two 16-inch and one 12-inch diameter water pipelines. All wells are operated manually from the water treatment plant.  Initially constructed around 1919, the treatment plant facilities were upgraded in 1942, 1956, 1968, 1984, and most recently in 1986. The chemical feed has been replaced to use liquid chemical feed. The treatment plant had an original design capacity of 8.3 MGD. The present day actual design capacity is 7.2 MGD. Recent average daily capacity has been 3.4 MGD.   The treated water is (approximately 3.4 MGD) is pumped into the distribution system through High Lift Pump Stations (HLPS) No. 1 and No. 2.  The Water Treatment Plant has an emergency generator with enough capacity to sustain full plant operations.   The water distribution system transports the water from the treatment plant, providing domestic, industrial and fire protection water throughout the Installation. The distribution system consists of approximately 90 miles of piping, valves, meters, fire hydrants and booster pump stations.   Four elevated storage tanks and three ground storage, with a combined capacity of approximately 3.035 million gallons, support the potable water distribution system.   All tanks have recently undergone extensive renovation.

WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
The wastewater collection system includes nine sewage lift stations, 58 miles of pipe/force mains, an advanced wastewater treatment plant, and effluent pipeline used to water the Installation’s 36-hole golf course. There is one wastewater pre-treatment facility in the NSA Complex, which is not a part of this privatization study. 

Wastewater Collection
All industrial and domestic wastewater collected from Ft. Meade, the NSA Complex and the D.C. Children’s Center is conveyed to the Fort Meade Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWTP) via 305,270 linear feet of sewer line, ranging from less than 4 inches in diameter to 30 inches in diameter, with the majority of the pipe size being 8 inches.  The large majority of the pipe is terra cotta clay.  There are 1,210 manholes.  Most of the wastewater collection system was constructed between the 1920s and the 1970s, with only replacement and upgrade work being completed since the 1970s. In 1998, upgrades to some of the trunk lines and manholes were performed. The work included relining of pipes, upgrading of manholes and some pipe replacement.

All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Interested sources shall contact Montrez Nicholson at (703) 767-9406 to be added to our bidders mailing list.

<DESC>Request for Information: This DRAFT Request for Proposals (RFP) is being released by the Internal Revenue Service to obtain public and private comments on this draft solicitation for an A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for Files Activities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The government is currently performing the work.

Subcontracting plan requirements will be included in the Draft RFP and will be included in any resulting solicitation.  Small business concerns are encouraged to pursue both prime and subcontracting opportunities under this Draft RFP.  The government anticipates hosting a pre-proposal conference which will enable small businesses to seek subcontracting opportunities with those companies looking to submit a proposal as a prime contractor.  The government anticipates that the competition will be unrestricted and award will be made to a single Service Provider.  It is anticipated that any resultant contract will be firm fixed price.  A DRAFT copy of the performance work statement (Section C) and other portions of the DRAFT RFP are available at the following IRS internet site: http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov (under Business Opportunities).  Technical Exhibit 5-001, Memphis Workload of the DRAFT RFP is currently being adjusted to reflect its closure in 2005.  Other files activity locations may be impacted and will be adjusted accordingly and prior to the release of the final RFP.

In accordance with FAR 15.201, this DRAFT RFP is an "exchange with industry before receipt of proposals".  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities.  Therefore, this DRAFT RFP allows potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, enhance the Government's ability to obtain quality services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  There is no Federal Acquisition Regulation requirement for a reply to the questions or comments received from posting a DRAFT RFP.  The IRS may choose to answer the questions received or directly incorporate pertinent responses into any resultant solicitation.  It is anticipated that the final RFP will be released on or about June 1, 2004. 

After issuance of a final RFP, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with SPs.  During the source selection process, the CO will open and evaluate all offers and tenders to determine acceptability.  The performance decision will be based on the lowest cost of all offers and tenders determined to be technically acceptable.  The closing date for the receipt of offers is planned 90 days after issuance of the final RFP.  In addition, the closing date for the submission of past performance data is planned for 45 days after issuance of the final RFP.  Any questions, comments, or suggestions pertaining this DRAFT RFP should be submitted by email only to the Contracting Officer, Charles J. Conrad, at awss.fileact@irs.gov, no later than Monday, April 12, 2004.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Any information provided is voluntary.  As such, the Government will not cover any costs for any information or inquiry submitted as a result of this request.  Should the Government have questions regarding individual responses, the responder will be contacted for further information.  To facilitate this contact, please include the name of point of contact, e-mail address and telephone number of this person.  This is a DRAFT RFP and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a FORMAL RFP, RFQ or contract.  Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement and intends to award a contract for the collection, format and dissemination of automated aircraft upper air weather observation data via the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS).  This data will be used in aviation models to produce more timely and accurate aviation weather analysis and forecast. The FAA also anticipates this requirement will include a task for the collection, and dissemination of the automated aircraft performance data providing funds are available at time of award. A contract performance period of 1 base year with 4 (12 months each) options is planned. The estimated contract value is $600K per year for a total of $3,000,000.00. The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market for available sources with the capabilities, resources and qualifications to provide the operational services required. Vendors interested in submitting a capability statement for this requirement must address all of the following: 1.	Demonstrate knowledge of Air-Ground and Ground-Ground communications paths and ground-ground protocols with participating Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting Service (MDCRS) Airlines. 2.	Ability to provide Datalink service to MDCRS participating airlines. 3.	Ability to communicate VHF D/L Service at over 200 domestic airport locations. 4.	Ability to receive Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) /MDCRS messages from any aircraft, anywhere in the CONUS. 5.	Ability to provide 24 x 7 network and service monitoring capability with the ability to respond any time a D/L outage occurs. 6.	Need to have CONUS field support network in place if remote maintenance is needed. 7.	Ability to receive (ACARS) messages which include MDCRS information from participating airlines by way of High Frequency, Very High Frequency or Satellite communications system. 8.	Ability to process the messages in such a way as to "strip off" the MDCRS data, reformat to BUFR format, and pass the message to the FAA and NWS by way of the FAA's NADIN II network. 9.	Ability to provide VHF datalink service agreements with service commitments that state that the service provider's VHF ACARS service is used as primary over any other provider in North America for airlines participating in the MDCRS program. If you are interested in being considered for this requirement, provide a written qualification statement (not to exceed 5 pages) (two copies) documenting each of the requirements listed above, including references.  The qualification statements will be evaluated to determine if the vendor is able to provide the level of expertise needed to fulfill this requirement.  The FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on the results of this survey.  If this survey results in a competitive acquisition, the competition will be limited to those vendors who responded to this survey and were evaluated and determined to be qualified for all factors. The new vendor must be able to provide immediate service, as to avoid any break in service with the current contract. The qualification statements should be forwarded to the Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington D.C. 20591.  Attention: Melda Dyer (ASU-340), Contracting Officer.  The date is prior to 4 pm Eastern Time on 26 March 2004.  The facsimile number is (202) 267-5130.  Please call prior to faxing any responses.

BACKGROUND: The life Connections Program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism.  Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter-faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self.  The program’s design will  increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration.   Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.  The program will enlist  partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change.  Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.  The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Faith-based Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.

<DESC>THIS IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTING THE INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT POSTED ON MARCH 18, 2004. INDUSTRY DAY DISCUSSIONS SHALL BE UNCLASSIFIED. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. System Description:  MUE is part of the overall Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernization Effort (Space/Control/Users).  The current security classification is secret. The tentative Modernization upgrades will result in the addition of several new Civil Signals as well as a new military signal and security architecture.  The MUE program is the user segment component of the GPS Modernization program and is to validate that user equipment can be developed that effectively interoperate and exploit the capabilities of the modernized constellation. The MUE Program is nearing completion of Phase A and is preparing to enter Phase B. Phase A activities consist of government development and assessment of MUE technical requirements, alternative acquisition strategies, and preliminary cost estimates.  Additionally, four (4) Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) contracts were awarded to reduce program risk. Contract tasks included contractor assessment of key technical and design issues related to security architecture, receiver design, and the inclusion of multiple signal processing, YMCA.  Phase A activities are now sufficiently mature to enter into Phase B. The MUE Phase B program is a development program with the objective of demonstrating Y-Code/M-Code/Course Acquisition (CA)-(YMCA) receiving and processing capability using the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) Security Architecture.  The MUE Program is not a production program and will not directly result in the procurement of MUE under the anticipated Phase B contract effort. The primary products of the development will be validated Government controlled, non-proprietary, specifications (specs) and Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for MUE variants of the current Ground Based GPS Receiver Application Module (GB GRAM), GRAM Standard Electronic Module type E (SEM-E), and a common GPS Engine. The GRAM SEM-E and GB-GRAM cards will be developed to validate that operationally relevant cards can be developed based on the Government specs and ICDs and to provide an initial industrial base to support further development and procurement. The GPS JPO will not procure MUE unless directed and funded to do so by the Services. It is anticipated that MUE procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service wide needs. The GPS Engine is anticipated to be a modular and scalable design implemented in Hardware Description Language (HDL) design files and software for the crypto processors, code generation engines, and key handling functions necessary to generate both the replica of the Modernized NAVSTAR Security Algorithm (MNSA) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Puncture Acquisition (PA), and Frequency Hop Acquisition (FA) Codes and the replica of the C/A, Y and P Codes.  The GPS Engine shall be capable of accepting, handling, and storing any key material needed for the GPS Engine to generate the stated codes. The GPS Engine is anticipated to be able to be a building block upon which a GPS card can be developed that will meet applicable air, ground, sea, and munitions user requirements. It is anticipated at this time that the GPS Engine will be implemented solely under PRONAV security requirements. The GPS Engine developed under this contract is expected to be an integral part of two receiver cards developed under this effort. GPS user equipment is an important element across the DOD force structure and represents a significant cost for the DOD. Accordingly, a major emphasis in this development will be to implement mechanisms that will reduce the cost of non-recurring engineering (NRE) development across all future MUE procurements. The government recognizes that the GPS Engine represents substantial development costs that are unique to MUE because of the new security architecture and security methods inherent to the M-Code signal and PRONAV.  The government seeks means to ensure that these and other NRE costs do not act as a barrier preventing potential suppliers and developers from entering the MUE market. Specifically, the government is currently investigating third party licensing agreements and data rights. The government's intent is that the data rights or third party licensing agreement would allow a third party not currently familiar with the MUE security architecture and security requirements to successfully compete for future MUE developments. Accordingly, respondents to the Industry Day announcement are encouraged to address their assessment of the value of data rights and/or licensing agreement and any other suggestions to assist the government in achieving its objective of reducing non-recurring engineering costs for the GPS Engine or MUE as a whole. Respondents are requested to identify any previous applicable experiences in supporting reduction of government NRE costs. In addition, the government is highly interested in receiving Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost for the development of the GPS Engine to include ROM cost for data rights and third party licensing agreements. Scope of effort: The MUE Phase B effort is anticipated to have a duration of 48 months, April 2005–April 2009. The government currently anticipates a single award for the Phase B contract. The selected MUE contractor or team will provide all technical, administrative, and management services necessary to: 1) Develop a YMCA GPS Engine able to meet all MUE applicable performance requirements, 2) Deliver the GPS Engine specifications and ICDs documentation, 3) Deliver the GPS Engine design file in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) at a level sufficient to test the engine design in an HDL functional test environment, 4) Imbed the GPS engine in the two receiver cards, GRAM-SEM-E and GB-GRAM, 5) Develop and deliver the two receiver cards in compliance with all technical, performance, schedule, and cost requirements (December 07-Threshold and April 08-Objective for cards delivery to government),  6) Recommend modifications to GB-GRAM and GRAM SEM-E specs and ICDs and applicable modifications to munitions and Generic MUE specs and ICDs 7) Develop and deliver test and product assurance plans to verify compliance with program and assurance requirements, 8)  provide technical support to Miniaturized Airborne GPS Receiver 2000 (MAGR-2K) Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) integration of the GRAM SEM-E and government testing of the GB-GRAM. Respondents to this announcement are encouraged to include in their capabilities statements Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost for the total effort described above. After the receiver cards have been developed and delivered to the government the GRAM SEM-E will be integrated under separate contract into the MAGR-2K to validate the GRAM SEM-E ICD.  The card developer will supply technical support under an associate contractor agreement during the integration effort. The government currently anticipates that the GB GRAM will be delivered to the government for government testing of the card for compliance with specs and ICDs and integrated into a to be determined LRU/platform.

<DESC>This posting is a modification to posting SN0401-HBG first appearing on FBO on January 9, 2004. The purpose of this posting is to incorporate Numbered Note 22 into the announcement. However, the the National Library of Medicine will only except response to this announcement until April 6, 2004. This notice of intent had previosly been posted for thirty days on FBO. Therefore, this notice supplements the prior notice by adding 15 additional days for receipt of responses to comply with the requirements of numbered note 22. The following text is a republication of the notice that appeared on the original posting date of January 9, 2004: -- "It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Washington, Seattle, WA for a cost reimbursement type contract for the creation and maintenance of records in the GeneTests database.  GeneTests is a database that contains the following principal components:  (1) peer-reviewed descriptions of genetic diseases written by subject matter experts including curated information on genetic tests for diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling; (2) a directory of laboratories which perform research and clinical testing for genetic disorders; (3) a directory of U.S. and international genetics clinics which provide genetic evaluation and genetic counseling services.  GeneTests contains over 210 disease descriptions written by clinical and laboratory experts and peer-reviewed by both an internal and external group of reviewers.  The disease descriptions follow a consistent format including topics on clinical descriptions, diagnosis, management, counseling, molecular genetics, and resources.  Each entry is regularly updated in a formal review process.  The laboratory directory includes over 570 laboratories performing clinical testing for 639 diseases and research on 350 diseases.  Testing includes DNA-based, cytogenetic, and biochemical tests.  Each entry contains the name, symbol, and synonyms for the tested gene, the chromosomal locus, laboratory personnel and genetics board certifications.  The clinics directory has over 1080 clinics listed with information on the staff certification, services provided, specialty clinics and contact information.  Educational materials are also available which provide a medical genetics glossary and explanations of genetic testing and consultation.  The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of GeneTests as a comprehensive and up to date source of genetic testing information for a diverse audience that includes both healthcare professionals as well as the lay public.    Specifically, this contract will add to and continuously update the content within each of the GeneTests resources as new information becomes available from the various scientific and clinical disciplines related to inherited disease susceptibility.  For GeneReviews the selection of disease profiles is based upon the availability of clinical testing procedures, the importance of testing in diagnosis, risk counseling, and early treatment.   Entries are created and peer-reviewed by scientists and clinicians recognized as experts for that specific disorder.  An in-house review process assures editorial consistency and integration of GeneReviews with the other GeneTests resources.  The content of the GeneTests database is copyrighted by the University of Washington and Children’s Health System.  The staff at the University of Washington have regularly been maintaining and updating the database since 1992 when the Laboratory Directory was established, followed by the GeneReviews disease descriptions in 1997.  Because the compilation of laboratories and of structured, expert-authored and peer-reviewed disease descriptions is unique, because the University of Washington owns the rights to the data, and because the University of Washington maintains the GeneTests database, it has been determined that the University of Washington is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM’s requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is an RFP available."

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 	two years

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 			Yerevan, Armenia	  				
8: POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.  Background 

USAID/Armenia became a full-fledged Mission in mid-1998, having previously been part of a larger regional Caucasus Mission. The program in Armenia is large, diverse, and politically sensitive.

Armenia is mountainous and arid. It is in transition from the Soviet system of laws, practices and attitudes to a market economy and democratically oriented system of government. Although Armenia has made significant progress on the political, economic and social fronts in the thirteen years since independence, there is still much room for improvement and much need for international support in this effort. In addition to its transition efforts, Armenia remains locked in conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is occupied by ethnic Armenians. The conflict is currently in a cease-fire, but there has yet been no peaceful resolution to the dispute.

The U.S. assistance program in the Caucasus is of particular strategic importance to the United States Government and enjoys high visibility and considerable interest from both the public and private sectors. In the early years of USAID involvement in Armenia, assistance was largely focused on humanitarian assistance to the extensive vulnerable population, including the large number of people displaced by internal conflicts in the region. The current USAID program is focused on helping to lay the foundation for sustainable development in the governance, economic, and social sectors. The portfolio of assistance activities is extensive, labor intensive, and requires close monitoring to ensure that it is having the desired impact.

The Senior Water & Energy Policy Advisor (SWEPA) position is in the USAID/Armenia Office of Economic Restructuring and Energy (EREO), one of two technical offices in the Mission. The SWEPA position will provide sector support in energy and water activities for: a) planning, managing, monitoring and evaluating USAID-funded technical assistance, training, and equipment and commodity procurement activities; b) advocating USAID/Armenia-sponsored legal and regulatory reforms, including privatization and sector restructuring; and c) supporting efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of integrated water resource management for enhanced environmental quality.

The general scope of SWEPA engagement includes liaising with senior energy, water, and environmental sector officials of the Government of Armenia (GOAM) and with key private sector organizations on the full range of energy and water assistance programs and on policy reform issues in the Mission portfolio on electricity and natural gas sector reform, energy efficiency and renewable energy resource development and integrated water resources management.

The objectives of the Mission’s water and energy program are found in Strategic Objective 1.5 of the new Mission strategy for FY 2004-2008, “Secure and Sustained Access to Energy and Water Resources.” SO 1.5 combines classic energy sector development and water supply/quality objectives that serve three overall, interrelated goals of U.S. assistance in Armenia: a) to promote enhanced energy security, recognizing that Armenia has limited indigenous fuel resources available; b) to provide critical economic infrastructure for growth and jobs; and c) to ensure reliable and affordable access to essential utilities for all Armenians. The strategy addresses institutional development of the governing bodies of the water and energy utilities and the delivery of safe, reliable, affordable and accessible public utilities. The problems relating to water and energy, including heat, must be solved to facilitate economic growth, raise Armenians’ living standards, and – not least important – build mutual trust and common purpose among government, the private sector, and the general citizenry. In addition, the program of activities under this SO supports the President Bush’s sustainable development initiatives for clean energy, water for the poor and global climate change. The Mission’s SO 1.5 program will support the GOAM to complete restructuring and commercialization of the existing state energy and water monopolies, including introducing commercial management practices in public utility companies. The program provides assistance to strengthen the independent regulatory body for the energy and water sectors, including working to improve the legal framework to enhance market development and attract foreign investment; it also supports development of sustainable financing mechanisms to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management and to develop Armenia’s renewable energy resources. Finally, SO 1.5 activities support GOAM efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of integrated water resource management, to prepare projects for IFI financing, and to improve the quantity and quality of regional dialogue on energy and water, both to improve resource management and to contribute to conflict resolution.

The SWEPA will be required to provide accurate and informed advice to Mission Management and key counterparts on the full range of energy and water sector issues, with particular emphasis on both policy reforms and implementation. S/he will require a depth of expertise that will allow her/him to provide leadership in these technical and policy reform areas to Mission Management, to Foreign Service National (FSN) staff, to partners and counterparts, and to customers. Key counterparts and customers will look to the Advisor to present viable and relevant policy options to address the complex and often conflicting array of energy and water sector issues.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST.  This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The Office for Domestic Preparedness is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy test for emergency response extrication devices and is inviting manufacturers to participate.
The intent of the user test program will be to provide the emergency response community user feedback and evaluation of equipment based on utilization of each piece of equipment selected in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response.  The results of testing will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) endorse any product or manufacturer.

The types of extrication devices being tested are ones that would be used by emergency responders while wearing Level A ensembles without motorized assistance to transport victims in a mass casualty event from the Hot Zone to the decontamination point in the Warm Zone.

The tests will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines  of agencies and jurisdictions across the US.  These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field.  The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out usimg the equipment.  The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator.  Some of the criteria could include:  usability, portability, train-up time, ergonomics, required manpower, maintenance, ease of use and practicality.

If you wish to identify your particular brand/product for potential testing in this user test program, please provide in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, address, point of contact, telephone, fax and e-mail address.  Additionally, send device information such as specifications (e.g., length, width, height, weight, load limit, etc). reliabiity, maintainability, support supply, shelf life, durability, any special storage or transportation requirements, environmental limits and safety reports.

Do not send your piece of equipment.  Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers ad the equipment is selected for testing.

<DESC>The US Army RDECOM, Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA is conducting a market survey for technical information on methods to reliably utilize weather balloons, radiosondes, aircraft-mounted systems, and ground-based systems to characterize the wind p rofile, pressure, temperature and humidity of the atmosphere ahead of and below a transport aircraft flying 25,000 feet mean sea level (MSL).  Wind data shall comprise magnitude and 3D direction vector with respect to a local-vertical local-horizontal refe rence frame.  The desired characteristics for such systems, in order of importance, are as follows: (1) capable of characterizing the wind speed and direction, as well as temperature, pressure and relative humidity, ahead of and below an aircraft flying at  25,000 feet MSL.  (2) Un-pressurized operation from the aircraft at altitudes of up to 25,000 ft MSL.  If system operation on an aircraft is not feasible ground operation will be considered.  (3) System shall be useable by personnel with a variety of tech nical skill levels. (4) Airborne systems shall be able to be attached to the ramp of the transport aircraft without aircraft modification and without interference to exiting payloads. (5) System weight less than or equal to 10 pounds for ground systems and  20 pounds for airborne systems. (6) Capable of wireless transmission of collected wind data to a laptop computer when the system is operated on the ground or in the aircraft.  Potential exists for future investment in this science and technology area.  It should be noted that this is an RFI and not a request for comment or request for proposals.  Nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI.  Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the p roperty of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.

<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) to develop Transponded Ka/Ku for FAB-T through modification of the Family of Advanced Beyond line of sight - Terminals (FAB-T) Contract F19628-02-C-0048, awarded to the Boeing Company, 3370 Miraloma Avenue, Anaheim, CA.  Transponded Ka/Ku is a concurrent development to the baseline FAB-T development in line with the original intentions set forth the FAB-T program Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP).  The government intends to contract with the Boeing Company as the only holder of a FAB-T contract under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case the United States Air Force (USAF) may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)).  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment.  Call Ms. Janice E. Sullivan at (781) 271-5485 or email at Janice.Sullivan@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice. Interested subcontractors should contact Boeing directly.  See Note 26.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to support the Navy’s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program for academic and simulator training on the C-37 aircraft (Navy configured Gulfstream V).  A commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract is anticipated with a 60-month period of performance commencing 1 October 2004.  North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 611512, size standard $21.5 million.  This acquisition is anticipated to be conducted in accordance with FAR 6.1, Full and Open Competition.  For informational purposes only, the incumbent contractor for these services is FlightSafety International.  

The following C-37 specific individual courses are required:  C-37 Pilot Initial Training, C-37 Pilot/Crew Chief Recurrent Training, C-37 Maintenance Initial, C-37 Flight Attendant/Emergency Initial Training and C-37 Flight Attendant/Emergency Recurrent Training.  The following individual non-aircraft specific International Procedures training courses are required:  Pilot Initial International Procedures Training and Pilot Refresher International Procedures Training.  The C-37 pilot courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Gulfstream V aircraft at time of training.  All contractor C-37 pilot instructors shall be certified under the 14 CFR Part 142 Training Center certification.  For all courses, the contractor shall provide:  all the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Pilot Initial course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  C-37 Pilot Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Navy, C-37 Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-37 Pilot Initial Course.  All International Procedures course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  These C-37 CACT program training courses require classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability, and a C-37, Level “D” flight simulator (GA-V-V or GA-V-SP).  In lieu of the CFT or PTT, a higher order device may be used.  The Flight Attendant/Emergency Initial Training and Flight Attendant/Emergency Recurrent Training courses must address all training areas required under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 as described in the Air Transportation Safety Inspector’s Handbook 8400.10, except where noted.  Training shall be given at a FAA approved 14 CFR Part 142 training center that commercially provides a 14 CFR Part 135 Flight Attendant/Emergency Training type course (FAA certification is not required).  The course shall minimally consist of classroom training, corporate class cabin trainer (similar to Gulfstream V) training, and in-pool water survival training that addresses equipment like that used in the C-37 (Gulfstream V).  The course shall be based around an existing core 14 CFR Part 135 course curriculum with some modifications (e.g., add training on government provided PRC-90-2 emergency radio operation) to address C-37 specific equipment.  Serving etiquette/protocol/menu training is required.  

Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-37 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi. The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-37 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.  Anticipated annual throughput for this requirement will be approximately 7 Pilot Initial students, 12 Pilot Recurrent students, 7 Crew Chief Recurrent students, 4 Maintenance Initial students, 5 Flight Attendant/Emergency Initial Training students, 5 Flight Attendant/Emergency Recurrent Training students, 8 Pilot Initial International Procedures Training students, and 4 Pilot Refresher International Procedures Training students.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to complete the ongoing evaluation of the federal Upward Bound program.  Upward Bound is one of the largest and longest running federal programs designed to help economically disadvantaged students prepare for, enter and succeed in college.  The contractor shall collect postsecondary transcripts, analyze survey and transcripts, and write the final Upward Bound report for the 5th follow up of the current evaluation.  The previous contract was awarded for a 5-year period.  That contract was extended due to the increasingly difficult nature of gaining cooperation from respondents.  In order for the study to be effective a high response rate was needed, the contract was extended in order to allow for more time to get the required response rates.  The extended time period still did not allow for the final components of the evaluation to be completed. This new procurement is a follow-on activity for the continued evaluation of the Upward Bound program that is inextricably related to two of the previous contracts.  The evaluation of the Upward Bound program will not be complete without the final data collection, analysis and reporting accomplished through this procurement.

This is not a request for proposal.  However, all interested parties should submit at letter of interest and capabilities statement by the closing date in the notice.  If any other capable, responsible sources are found, this procurement will be opened for full and open competition.  See Numbered Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>06032004
<CONTACT>Jane Watters, 732-427-1322
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  Program Manager Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) is seeking sources and information for a multi-mode Electro-Optic/Infrared/Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) with minimal development, for application as the mul ti-mode payload for US Army's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems.  PM RUS is developing its acquisition strategy for an EO/IR/LD payload that would be integrated and operated on board various Army UAVÃ¢Â€Â™s.  PM RUS will use this information to assess industryÃ¢Â€Â™s capability and develop an appropriate acquisition strategy for the payload.  A payload consists of the turret, IR sensor, EO sensor, Laser Range Finder/Designator and all associated electronics and cabling.  EO/IR/LD PAYLOAD REQUIREMENTS: The payload must be capable of operating day and night, detect and recognize operationally meaningful targets at survivable standoff ranges, be capable of determining range to target, be capable of designating targets for precision guided standoff weapons.   The ability to provide such a capability to the supported commander will greatly increase battlefield effectiveness.  While functioning on board the UAV, the payload will provide a forward looking day/night capability to develop and display continuous, fully focused imagery to battlefield commanders. This payload should be capable of autonomous preplanned operations and a lso be capable of instantaneous re-tasking throughout a mission.  The payload will provide continuous zoom capabilities when in EO mode and multiple fields of view (FOV) when in IR mode, selectable by the Mission Payload Operator (MPO).  This payload will need to support auto track functions and auto-search functions. The EO/IR/LD payload, operating at 10,000 to 12,000 ft AGL, will be a multi-mode sensor package with resolution sufficient to detect, recognize, laser range find and designate an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) sized target (3.5m x 3.5m, 4Ã‚Â°C Delta T) fr om an effective threshold slant range of 8 km, with an objective of 16 km, and shall Identify an APC-sized target at 4 km, with an objective of 8 km.  Imagery will be transmitted to a Ground Control Station (GCS) or network via system data links.  The payl oad is expected to be capable of providing both analog and digital imagery outputs, be NGA compliant, and incorporate auto-search/track algorithms.  Both TV and FLIR sensors should be capable of progressive scan video to support image mosaics. Probability of Detection, Recognition and Identification.  The payload will require a Probability of Detection (Pd), Probability of Recognition (Pr) and Probability of Identification (Pi) of 90% each for IR and EO respectively, given the APC-sized target. Modes of Operation.  This payload will require Staring, Strip, and Spot Wide Area Search Modes for step-stare image mosaics, and precision video geographic registration. The payload will be able to slew 360 degrees on command from the MPO.  Search Rate.  This payload should be able to cover a minimum 200 sq km per hour area, in narrow field of view.  This assumes an air vehicle flying at 70 Knots at 10,000 AGL.  The imagery collected must meet the recognition requirement of 8 km of an APC-siz ed target listed above. Color.  The EO sensor will require full visible spectrum color imagery and be capable of black and white imagery when selected by the mission payload operator. Fields of View (FOV). The EO sensor shall have a continuous zoom.  The IR sensor shall have a minimum three Fields of View (FOV): narrow, medium, & wide; selectable, correlated/co-boresighted with the laser designator. Target Location Error (TLE).  The TLE of the payload shall not exceed 25m at a slant range of 8km. Eye Safe Laser Range Finder/Designator.  The payload should have the capability to accurately range and designate for precision guided munitions against stationary and moving targets.  This payload augmentation shall be capable of suppor ting concurrent Air to Ground Missile (ATGM) engagements of two or more targets.  The payload must be capable of Laser designation/ range finding to 8 km threshold slant range with an objective of 16 km.  These slant ranges assume weapon Lock on After Laun ch (LOAL). The Lock on After Launch (LOAL) assumes 8Km from the UAV to the target and 4km of reflected energy from the target to the weapon for the threshold requirement. The operator must have sufficient resolution to maintain the designator on target at the required ranges.  The payload will require sufficient stabilization to keep the designator on target while operating from vibrating environments expected to be encountered on rotary wing platforms.   Additional Payload Requirements.  In addition to the requirements listed above, the following capabilities maybe required:   (a)  Aided Target Cueing (AiTC).  To provide an automatic cue to the MPO indicating the presence of potential targets within a scene.   (b)  Aided Target Recognition (AiTR).  To provide the MPO with an automated aid to recognize targets within a scene.   (c)  Aided Target Identification (AiTI).  To provide the MPO an automatic target identification capability for selected targets, and is dynamically reprogrammable from the GCS.  Vendors are encouraged to submit responses that contain the capability of multiple sensors if appropriate.  The Government is categorizing the responses by size of sensor and achievable performance.  The diameters of the payloads of interest are between 10 Ã¢Â€Â and 16Ã¢Â€Â, with associated weights of between 40 and 130 pounds. The weight includes the turret and all the electronics required to operate the payload and associated intra-system cabling.   It is requested the responses provide at a minimum: 1.	A description of payload(s) and their capabilities against ALL the requirements stated above to include: Range performance: 90% probability of detection/recognition/identification ranges given an APC sized target (3.5mx3.5m, 4Ã‚Âº C Delta T) , FOVÃ¢Â€Â™ s, focal lengths and F numbers for each FOV, number of vertical and horizontal detectors, detector pitch, detector material, payload stabilization given a rotary wing environment.  Minimum altitudes and slant ranges required to meet a 200 km/hr search rate  and underlying assumptions to include; altitude, down-look angle, settling time, gimbalsÃ¢Â€Â™ max acceleration. Also include any data link requirements. 2.	Anticipated or actual dimensions, weight and power consumption broken down by component and for the overall payload.  Provide interface control information to include input/output interfaces and mounting interfaces.   3.	Laser Range Finder/Designator information should include wavelength(s), output power, beam divergence, target location error and underlying assumptions to include; atmospheric assumption, internal mounting stability, target size and aspect angle. 4.

<SUBJECT>66 -- PEGASUS 2000N
<DESC>The U.S.Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Delta-Sigma Inc. for the purchase of three Pegasus-2000N. It is essential that the systems be compatible with a previous prototype system. Maintainability, mean time to repair, data quality, data repeatability and data interfaces are all necessary factors to ensure the success of this on-going project. The following specifications are required:  An RF amplifier to be used in a pulse Doppler radar wind profiler (RWP). (RWP's are highly sensitive and operate similar to other Doppler radars. They produce winds by capturing and averaging clear-air backscatter pulse energy{coded or non-coded}, directed nearly vertically, typically through the use of a ground-based planar coaxial-collinear antenna.) The required salient features of the amplifier are:  
1.Operate at a center frequency of 449 MHz with a -1 dB bandwidth of 10 MHz
2.Produce 2kW peak power at its output port
3.Operate at a duty cycle of up to 20%
4.Operate with a pulse length of 0.4 to 30.0 microseconds
5.Utilize RF input pulse rise/fall times of 1.0 to 100 nanoseconds
6.Produce output pulse rise/fall times of no greater than 100 nanoseconds
7.Utilize input RF power of +0.0 to +30.0 dBm
8.Operate into any load impedance at any phase (to infinite VSWR) with automatic recovery
9.Have a nominal input/output impedance of 50 ohms
10.Produce no more than -60 dBc spurious content
11.Produce no more than -50 dBc harmonic content
12.Produce no more than -110 dBm per MHz interpulse spectral density
13.Have no more than 10 degrees interpulse phase error
14.Have less than 0.5 dB pulse (chip) amplitude stability
15.Have no more than 0.2 dB pulse-to-pulse stability
16.Have over-temp protection, indication, and automatic recovery
17.Have over-drive protection, indication, and recovery
18.Have TTL RF disable control circuitry and indication
19.Operate indoors in a standard 19 inch electronics rack
20.Operate at temperatures of +10 to +35 degrees Celsius
21.Operate at humidity levels of 0 to 95% (non-condensating)
22.Have simplified maintenance/repair features
23.Have a mean-time-between-failures of no less than +90,000 hours
24.Utilize forced-air for cooling
25.Utilize RF stray radiation prevention measures

<SUBJECT>58 -- Emergency Managers Weather Information Network User & Vendor Conference
<DESC>The National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) are sponsoring an Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) User and Vendor conference to be held on 27 April 2004 at the NWS Headquarters, 1325 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  NWS and NESDIS managers will brief to all interested parties the changes which will be required in the EMWIN satellite broadcast system coincident with the operational deployment of the new generation of  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) satellites.  EMWIN is a suite of data access methods (satellite broadcast, internet, VHF or UHF radio) which makes available a live stream of weather and other critical emergency information to the public but especially to emergency managers.   This conference will only address the impact upon EMWIN satellite broadcast dissemination which has been in service via the present generation of GOES satellites for over eight years.  Existing receivers, marketed by commercial vendors to the public, will require modification or upgrading providing an opportunity for those vendors already marketing receivers or who wish to enter the market.  The conference will review the reasons for the change in the GOES satellites, the specifications for the new system and a prototype design using software-defined concepts.  The latter part of the meeting will be devoted to questions, comments and recommendations from the attendees which will be used to refine a draft transition plan.   Further information on the EMWIN system may be found at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.   Conference registration is available as a link from this URL.Questions or comments may be submitted to William A. Johnson, (301) 713-0864 x133 or Robert Wagner (301)-713-0864 x109. Registration closing date is April 20, 2004. Security procedures: All briefings are unclassified.  Visitors to the NWS Headquarters will be required to show official picture identification (drivers license or similar ID) and to sign in.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 
Contractor support for Logo Development and Branding


	I.	BACKGROUND

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), located in Washington, D.C., is one of the world's leading statistical agencies. Although it is a relatively small agency, BEA produces some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, business people, households, and individuals. BEA's economic statistics, which provide a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the U.S. economy, are key ingredients in critical decisions affecting monetary policy, tax and budget projections, and business investment plans. 

The cornerstone of BEA's statistics is the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which feature the estimates of a gross domestic product (GDP) and related measures. The GDP was recognized by the Department of Commerce as its greatest achievement of the 20th century and has been ranked as one of the three most influential measures that affect U.S. financial markets. Since the NIPAs were first published, BEA has developed and extended its estimates to cover a wide range of economic activities. Today, BEA prepares national, regional, industry, and international accounts that present essential information on such key issues as economic growth, regional economic development, inter-industry relationships, and the nations’ position in the world economy.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR
UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY
BATTERY AND CABINET REPLACEMENT
BUILDING 301, WEST WING
MARCH  2004



1.0  SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES.  remove and dispose of all batteries in the battery room for 400 KVA EXIDE UPS system model  3330AF,(bldg 301 n/w corner). remove and dispose of the eight EXIDE cabinets and 279 batteries. Provide and install 93 batteries and two cabinets.

2.0  CONTRACTOR TASKS.

2.1  The contractor shall remove the 279 Power brand  TC-12100 batteries now in the battery room. each cabinet has 31 batteries installed. The contractor shall remove the eight EXIDE  battery cabinets now in the battery room, leaving the Power CR6 cabinet. All removed items shall be disposed in compliance with applicable EPA requirements.

3.0  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE   The contractor shall complete all work within 30 days of contract award. Work shall be performed during normal duty hours, Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Excluding federal holidays

answers to extraneous questions

1. five of the old batteries have split cases.

2. the exide cabinets now in use are 32X32X72 inch closed cabinets.

3. the batteries to be removed are 12X10X7 inches and 66 pounds each.

4.disconnect to be on load side only. alarm connection is not required.  location of disconnect on each of the new cabinet is optional, so long as it can be operated without removing any any part of the cabinet.


Items 1.0; 2.1; 2.3; 2.4
1)     Thirty-one (31) 12-volt batteries equal a DC bus of 372 volts.  If the specification of the DC bus on the ups indicated is accurately reported as 422 volts, the 31 battery requirement per cabinet seems inaccurate.  To obtain a 422 volt DC bus using 12V batteries, 35 batteries per cabinet are required (422 / 12 = 35).
a.      Please advise if the UPS DC Bus is accurately reported as 422 volts?
b.     Please advise if the number of batteries per cabinet should be 31 or 35?
c.     Please advise if the total number of batteries desired is 93 or 105?
The SOW doesn't contain the term '12 volts'. 6 cell lead-acid batteries such as those listed in the SOW are generally referred to as 12 volt. however,a fully charged battery of this type has an actual voltage of 13 and a fraction

Items 2.2 and 3.4
 
1) Is not a UV shunt trip desired for disconnect on each of the two new battery cabinets?  A UV shunt is not required.
 
Item 2.2
 
1)     Specification does not address utilization of refurbished battery cabinets.  As battery cabinets are basically sheet metal boxes and occasionally changed by customers, are manufacturer designed refurbished cabinets acceptable versus new cabinets?
a.      Considerable dollars can be saved by the Government using this solution.  
b.     Interior electrical components (breakers, wiring, batteries) are all new and enable UL rating to be maintained.
c.     Exterior and interior of sheet metal are freshly painted and cosmetically reflect new cabinets without the additional cost
 
2)     Are refurbished manufacture specified battery cabinets acceptable?
 Refurbished cabinets are not acceptable.

 
Item 2.2
 
1)      To ensure we are understanding the battery cabinet specification correctly, INTRAPACK IC06 or POWER CR6 or EQUIVALENT battery cabinets may be utilized?  Yes
 
 
Item 2.3
 
1)     To ensure we are understanding the specification correctly with respect to new batteries, only Model S12V370 (GNB) 
     or C&D or DEKA batteries may be proposed?
a.      Power Batteries are unacceptable?
Power Batteries are not acceptable.

1)     Will existing termination cables be used to connect the new cabinets?  Existing cables can be used.
2)     Will the cable from cabinets removed need to be mined out?  Cables from removed cabinets are to also be removed.
3)     Verify DC link is 422 volts ( this voltage is not real common, could be a specific need for customer)  DC link is 422 volts.
4)     Verify 31 batteries per cabinet (odd # of batteries)
5)     Verify Power CR6 cabinet is what they want (spec sheet indicates that this cabinet will accommodate only 30 batteries)  31 batteries per string is correct.  CR6 is one option, if you prefer, IC06 can be used.
6)     What type of access to work area (loading dock, ramp, any stairs or raised floor) The building does have a loading dock,2 1/2 to 3 feet above ground level. there are no ramps, stares or raised floors involved in this project.

7)     Is there a staging area for the equipment.  There is no staging area.

2.3 USTDA RESPONSIBILITY-USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4 CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL-The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5 CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS-The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6 USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES-If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE- Trade in the Baltic States is growing, and has steadily increased over the last five years.  The U.S. alone exported approximately $448 million in goods to the three Baltic States in 2002, and imported approximately $389 million (not including the transshipment of goods according to the U.S. Department of Commerce).   The U.S. is an important trading partner to the Baltic States, yet only represents a small percentage of the total trade that transpires in the Baltic region.  The region is beginning to thrive and market itself as the gateway to the Nordics, Russia, and the EU.  The increase in trade has helped these economies launch themselves into the world market, but it has brought with it increasing security concerns that the governments are trying to address.

Specifically, the Government of Lithuania has experienced difficulty in controlling the transshipment of goods, including illegal goods, across its borders through the Port of Klaipeda and the Vilnius airport.  The Port of Klaipeda is Lithuania’s only deep port that handles the majority of maritime exports and imports to and from the country.   Lithuania has witnessed an increase in cargo and passenger traffic at the port over the last few years.  This increase in traffic is due in part to easy access to Russia via train from Klaipeda.  The government has already taken measures to increase security at the Vilnius airport, with the help of the U.S. Department of Energy, by purchasing new radioactive screening devices at the airport.  This equipment was provided by a U.S. company and seeks to address one level of security screening. According to the Lithuanian government, they need to have broader security measures in place at the airport and specifically at the Port of Klaipeda to fully contain and control the flow of goods.

Similar problems have been identified in Latvia and Estonia at the Port of Ventspils, Riga, Tallinn and Muuga.  Therefore, the proposed DM will examine the current customs facilities and operations at the major ports and airports throughout the Baltic States to determine what security measures are needed to help ensure the safe flow of goods.  

This DM will require a team that is experienced in three transportation sub-sectors: air, land, and sea.  The team will need to show strengths in airport/port security, scanning and surveillance, integrated IT systems and customs handling procedures.  The team also must exhibit strengths in port management, berth capacity expansion, customs control systems, and passenger terminal screening and handling facilities.  A major portion of the mission will be dedicated to an extensive review of the Baltic ports including the following: Klaipeda, Ventspils, Riga, Tallinn, Muuga and possibly Liepaja. The team will also need to be aware of various transportation linkages between the various airports and ports including rail and popular trucking routes. The team will need to examine the screening capabilities of each facility to handle containers being transferred by truck or train.  The Consultant will be expected to consult with TSA, FAA, DOE and USAID to determine where other U.S. Government agencies are planning to develop related projects.  This mission should take place over the course of two business weeks.  The likely timing for the mission would be late April or May 2004.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

  The Romanian Government is currently making considerable progress towards the development of a market economy for the energy sector.  The current government has implemented a far-reaching economic reform program for the sector.  The reform package focuses on eliminating price controls, freeing the exchange rate, eliminating subsidies, allowing bank privatization, encouraging foreign investment, and speeding up industry restructuring and privatization.  

The main challenges in the Romanian energy sector are-
Low efficiency of energy use due to old and inefficient technologies; 
Dilapidated state of assets, compounded by poor operations and maintenance; 
Vertical integration of enterprises, and an absence of competition; 
Inadequate regulatory systems;
Lack of economic criteria in planning and investment selection; 
Over employment and operational inefficiencies; 
Weak financial position of enterprises and the accumulated debt; and 
Environmental pollution.

The government’s strategy to address those challenges has been to-
Reorganize to separate policy and strategy operational functions;
Allow for the participation of public and private independent operators in a competitive environment;
Screen the energy sector investments to favor the highest priority investments;
Implement energy price reforms to align process with economic costs; and 
Promote the rehabilitation of the existing energy infrastructure. 

The reform measures have now had major impacts on all of the aspects of the country’s energy sector.  Legislation, either currently under development, or in force has helped implement the new policy; it includes: (1) a new petroleum law; (2) replacement regulations for electricity and heat with respect to technical standards and the relationship between suppliers and customers; (3) a new electricity law for regulating electricity generating companies, access to the electricity transmission system and investment in the electricity sector; (4) new regulations on standards for the use of electricity; and (5) a law on energy conservation.  

As a result of these reforms, several of the leading Romanian oil, gas and power generation and distribution companies have sought assistance from USTDA to comply with Romania’s new legislation, and to prepare to meet even higher European Union (EU) regulations.  

USTDA has received proposals from various sources for funding consideration. Please note that the following is a preliminary look at the proposed projects to be considered as part of this DM.
S.C. Electrocentrale Bucuresti S.A. – (a state-owned subsidiary of Termoelectrica that focuses on generation, transportation, distribution, dispatching and trading thermal energy) 
Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) Systems for Boilers No. 1 and 2 From Craiova II CHP
Assistance to Optimize Operating Systems for the Five Bucharest CHPs
Upgrading of the Ash and Slag Yard Stability Using High Density Fluid at Craiova II CHP
Buzau Mayoralty in cooperation with Eninvest S.A. – Buzau Municipality District Heating Plant Repowering Project (additional work to a previously funded USTDA study)

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

 After participating in the Cancun Ministerial (September, 2003) meeting under the Doha Development Agenda, USTDA expressed willingness to support a Definitional Mission to West Africa to review agriculture sector project development opportunities. 

The Agriculture Sector projects to be identified and analyzed during the DM would achieve a variety of developmental objectives for the two countries.  Agricultural development in West Africa, and in particular the two subject countries, is a key priority for the overall development of the region.  Increased agricultural production would likely lead to increased economic flows internally and increased hard currency from the export of agricultural products to the regional market.  USTDA can play an important role in ensuring that priority projects do not stall in their development by assisting growth in this sector.  Agriculture sector projects are also an increasing priority of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and recommended projects may support this export objective.  

Agriculture in the subject countries is a key driver of the economies and their largest employer.  Moreover, agricultural sales generally comprise the largest component of each country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  The Definitional Mission consultant will work with each country’s Ministry of Agriculture and other leading organizations in the agriculture sector to identify opportunities that would support agriculture development.  The Definitional Mission consultant will consider constraints that are imposed on USTDA considering impacts on U.S. labor.

The selected DM contractor will meet with the embassies of both countries in the United States to better identify the priority commodities for each.  Similarly, the DM contractor will set up meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture in each country to identify specific projects that USTDA could support, as well as private sector firms as appropriate.  
 
About AGOA:
The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was signed into law on May 18, 2000 as Title 1 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000.  The Act offers tangible incentives for African countries to continue their efforts to open their economies and build free markets.  For more information see: http://www.agoa.gov/
