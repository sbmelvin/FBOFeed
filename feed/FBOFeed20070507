<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a requirement for an enterprise commercial off the shelf web based, Point of Care Clinical Knowledge Product that will be made available throughout the VHA healthcare system.  For the purpose of this solicitation announcement, these products may also be referred to as bedside information tools because they have been designed to provide information at the patient's bedside or point of care.  The product provides information that will directly affect patient care. What distinguishes these products from sources such as electronic textbooks or bibliographic citations databases that may link to full text is this emphasis on point-of-care, patient-oriented information. These products are distinctly different from text-based, point-of-care sources such as printed guidelines: these electronic resources are updated much more frequently than print resources and provide tools for easily searching and sharing information.  The desired goals of the nationwide provision of a commercial Point of Care Clinical Knowledge Products are as follows: 1.  Providing access nationwide to standard knowledge based clinical information resources available at the point of care, will build on the enterprise wide availability of the web based version of New England Journal of Medicine; 2.  Making this Point of Care Clinical Knowledge Product available through CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System), the VA's Electronic Health Record, nationwide to insure consistent access at the bedside for all VHA health professionals and staff.  The Government plans to award a firm fixed price contract for the subscription period of  one year, with three option years.  This acquisition is issued unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 516110.  The size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees.  A contract will be awarded with discussions resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation that will be most advantageous to the Government.  The solicitation will be posted to this website-FedBizOpps-for downloading and will provide all necessary information for offerors to prepare and submit a proposal.  Responses to the solicitation must be received by close of business, as indicated in the solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  This announcement does not constitute the solicitation.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Karen Lebo, Contract Specialist, Phone:  440-397-3584.  Email address is Karen.lebo2@va.gov.

<DESC>Office of Naval Research (ONR)Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
for Payload Implosion and Platform Damage Prediction and Validation Implosion is the sudden inward collapse of a pressure resistant structure. For example, a submerged pressure housing with an internal pressure well below the ambient sea pressure may fail due to the external pressure. Following the collapse, a strong pressure wave is radiated into the surrounding fluid. This pressure wave depends sensitively on the exact form of the collapse. The resulting energetic pressure pulse can potentially damage nearby structures. 

The Navy requires an improved capability to design and qualify submarine external payloads for implosion avoidance and platform survivability. Validated, user-friendly tools are required that enable the designer to predict implosion effects, especially the magnitude of the resulting shock waves: In particular, the Navy needs 1) a parametric payload design tool for conventional payloads, and 2) a physics-based model for complex analyses. This requires both algorithm and software development, and carefully controlled measurements to validate the software.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for window and door renovation of the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The windows and doors are now over 100 years old and exhibit the condition that results from age and repeated exposure to northern winters, including deteriorated and peeling paint, cracked and rotten wood, missing glazing and worn weather stripping. The intent of this project is to restore the original windows and doors. This restoration will stop ongoing deterioration, improve energy efficiency and enhance the appearance of this historic building. 

The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1 million to $5 million, with an expected project duration of a total of 12 months, to be completed in 2 phases (May through October 2007 and May through October 2008). Work for this project is expected to begin in May 2007. A qualified contractor will be selected using a best-value source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR. All elements of work to be executed must be within congressionally mandated cost limitations. Funds are currently not available for this acquisition. This will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.

The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and offers the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and the evaluated price. For this procurement, technical factors will be significantly more important than price.

Small Business Participation: This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned and service disabled veteran-owned businesses are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort.

Proposal Submission Requirement: The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on January 5, 2007. The RFP will not be available on the FedBizOpps website. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the RFP and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. The RFP cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical data Solution (FedTeDS).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is attached. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical center (WJHTC) has a potential requirement for Air-to-Ground and Telecommunications Support Services, as described in attached draft Statement of Work.  The work contemplated was previously procured using the General Services Administration's Information Technology schedule and was awarded to Titan Systems Corporation.  The intent of this announcement is to determine if there are interested and capable Small Businesses.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  The results of the survey will aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside the requirement for small businesses when the formal screening information request (SIR) for offers is prepared. The work contemplated includes key personnel in each of the following North American Industry Code Standard (NAICS):   NAICS 		Description			Size Standard 541330	Engineering Services			$4.5 million 517110	Wired Telecommunications Carriers 	1500 employees Small businesses with the requisite capabilities are welcomed to submit responses if they qualify under either NAICS size standard.   The FAA estimates that there will be a need for Air-to-Ground and Telecommunications Support Services for the next 5 years and anticipates awarding a single, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract on or about August 1, 2007.

<SUBJECT>16--Improved Brake System Program for the T-38C Aircraft
<SOLNBR>FA8617-07-R-6171
<RESPDATE>020907
<ARCHDATE>03312008
<CONTACT>Karen Shelley, (937) 904-4217
<DESC>1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide  answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide  any additional information to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence to Attn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mail brandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager (937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response  to no more than 10 single-sided 8  x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point  font size. 1 Attachment RFI Questions Attachment 1 RFI Questions 1.

<DESC>On April 25, 2007, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Information Forum for interested parties regarding GSA?s proposed plan for the Elbert P. Tuttle Court of Appeals Building in Atlanta, Georgia.  This Forum will be held in the Equitable Building, 100 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA  30303 from 10:00am to 12:00pm in the fifth floor conference room.  

The agenda for the Forum will include a presentation of the scope of the design-build contract and an overview of the procurement process for the design-build contract followed by a question and answer period.  Following the Forum, there will be an optional guided walking tour of the buildings to be rehabilitated which are located two blocks from the Equitable Building where the Forum is to be held.

The proposed Tuttle Annex will provide administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The project consists of: 1) the rehabilitation and adaptive use of two existing historic buildings located behind the Tuttle Courthouse in the Fairlie Popular Historic District and 2) new construction of ancillary space including a security screening area, loading dock, solid waste disposal/storage, underground secure parking, and a pedestrian tunnel between the annex and the existing Tuttle Courthouse.  The area of the two existing historic buildings to be rehabilitated is approximately 123,000 gsf, while the area of new construction totals approximately 11,000 gsf for a total project area of approximately 134,000 gsf.  


General construction, design-build, A/E, and other subcontractor and consulting firms capable of providing or teaming with other firms to provide design-build services will have an opportunity to learn about the project, the process for selecting the design-build contractor, participate in a question and answer session, and tour the existing buildings to be rehabilitated. 

THIS IS NOT AN REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

Questions regarding this Forum should be directed to PAUL DEHAVEN, PROJECT MANAGER, 404-331-5329 OR PAULA MENSAH, CONTRACTING OFFICER, 404-331-2748 email paulal.mensah@gsa.gov.

The Government will contact references for the purpose of validating the information provided in response to this factor as well as obtaining further insight into each Offeror?s corporate safety philosophy.   The frequency and severity of events may have significant impact in the rating assigned to this factor (where 
(1) ?frequency? denotes ?quantity of accidents, mishaps, and similar incidents, and how often the incidents occur, and (2) ?severity? pertains to degree of injury, number of victims, and other casualty-related impacts).  The Government reserves the right to call any or all previous clients for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding your record of accidents and mishaps

PAST PERFORMANCE? PHASE I
Past Performance information is one indicator of an Offeror?s ability to perform this contract successfully.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The relevancy and source of the information, context of data, and general trends in a contractor?s performance shall be taken into consideration.  The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Offeror and establishes a level of confidence or risk for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the relative standing of the Offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.

By contacting references provided under Factors 1 and 2, the Government will evaluate the Offeror?s past performance.  Offerors are authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective actions taken.  In investigating the Offeror?s past performance, the Government is not limited to the references submitted but may rely on other sources as well.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as well as fair and reasonable pricing.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror?s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the Offeror?s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management, and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the Offeror?s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior, and in general, the Offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer. 

Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the Offeror?s response will be taken into consideration.  A review of CCAS and ACAS may be performed.


PHASE II. EVALUATION FACTORS.  Please do not respond to Phase II factors at this time.  The following factors may be included Phase II, and their full text will be provided in the solicitation.  In Phase II: (1) the total of all Phase I and II technical/management factors; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Price, are considered equal in importance.

FACTOR 5b ? Subcontracting Plan

FACTOR 6 ? Design Solutions

FACTOR 7 -  Design and Construction Schedule

FACTOR 8 -  Contract Organizational Structure

PRICE  - Price will be evaluated during Phase II in terms of reasonableness based on a comparison of the Government Estimate and other offers received.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is constructing a biological high containment National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland (referred to as the IRF hereafter) to enable NIAID researchers to track disease process and clinical outcomes of select agents and other emerging infectious diseases.  The IRF was created to carry out biodefense research needed to understand the clinical disease processes that correlate with the severity of microbial-induced disease.  Central to the core mission of the IRF is the use of hospital tools such as endoscopy, cardiac telemetry monitors, and CT, MRI, SPECT, and PET imaging to systematically evaluate the pathogenic processes and clinical course of disease in animal models exposed to microbes. Research emphasis will be placed on high consequence infections requiring high levels of biocontainment: most Category A viral and bacteria pathogens plus newly emerging infectious disease microbes. In addition to addressing scientific questions related to microbes?  basic biology and disease-causing mechanisms (including microbial components that define a pathogen?s life cycle, transmission, virulence and invasiveness), a key goal is to correlate these findings with clinical test (telemetry and imaging) results.  Evaluation of these data in turn depends on development of animal models which faithfully replicate the human disease syndromes, including a respiratory route of exposure. This knowledge is crucial to the development of preventative and therapeutic strategies and will not only lead to improved medical outcomes at the hospital bedside but for public health in general.

The NIAID Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a requirement to provide all the Scientific, Technical and Administrative services required to operate and manage a NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF). The NIAID anticipates a three-year base contract with three possible award terms for potential of ten years in total. This is not a Request for Proposals.  Small business utilization will be included as a factor in the technical evaluation.  Small business concerns are encouraged to add their contact information to the Interested Vendors List which will be published for this requirement.  The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about May 14, 2007 from www.fedbizopps.gov.  No hard copies will be distributed.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Alexander Kramer (kramera@niaid.nih.gov).

<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: 	Program name 	Government or contractor POC 	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. 	Date & period of performance 	Cost of effort 	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, were looking for ways to implement a throttle  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007.

<DESC>BACKGROUND Marines engaged in combat operations wear a suite of body armor that includes a ballistic helmet.  This helmet is either the USMC Lightweight Helmet (LWH) with a pad suspension system or the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH).  A number of additional pieces of equipment are being attached to, or worn with, the helmet.  These include night vision devices, spectacles, goggles, flashlights or infrared (IR) illuminators, radio headsets, and/or ear protection.   As the threat has continued to evolve, a requirement has been realized for additional ballistic facial protection and lower mandible protection devices.  Additionally, the requirement for communications equipment integration and a universal mounting system for the employment of the additional pieces of equipment has become evident as we have fielded a greater amount of equipment.  The Marine Corps is taking a system-of-systems approach to headborne equipment integration and desires to procure a suite of equipment that use the current inventory of helmets as a foundation.  With the system in place, Marines will be able to select components to wear either alone or combined as required.  This capability provides the desired modular, integrated systems approach to the helmet. SOURCES SOUGHT MARKET RESEARCH.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps Systems Command invites industry to provide information on their capability to provide a Headborne Integration System (HBIS), that includes a lightweight system that will affix to both the LWH and MICH (without any modification) and will provide mounting points for other equipment, including:  (1) a transparent face shield that provides ballistic protection to the face area between the helmet and the lower mandible protector; (2) a lower mandible protection device that will provide a level of ballistic protection from the transparent face shield to below the lower mandible commensurate with the level provided by the LWH while still allowing for the proper sighting of an individual or crew served weapon; (3) a universal mounting device for current and future optics; (4) and open-architecture mounting points for additional equipment, such as flashlights, illuminators, ear phones, or other equipment that may b!  e required in the future.   HEADBORNE INTEGRATION SYSTEM (HBIS) COMPONENT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS Attachment System The attachment system shall affix to the helmet without requiring additional attachment holes and without degrading the ballistic protection, durability and rigidity of the helmet.  This attachment system is intended to integrate with the helmet to provide a platform for the scalability of protection for the design.  The attachment system shall integrate communications wiring.   Face Shield A transparent face shield that mounts to the attachment system is required for additional ballistic protection for the face.  The face shield shall be easily removed by the user as desired without requiring a special tool.  The face shield must, at a minimum, meet the ballistic requirements set forth in MIL-V-43511C, clause 3.5.10.  The shield shall minimize distortion and optical haze.  The face shield shall be resistant to fogging.  The face shield should be able to be worn with the current ballistic eyewear (ESS ICE2X Spectacles).  The face shield shall allow for the integration of a lower mandible protection device and other equipment worn with the HBIS.  The face shield shall not interfere with the ability of a Marine to properly sight and employ individual and crew served weapons affixed with current and future optics, aiming devices, and head-mounted optics.  The weight of the face shield shall not exceed 0.3 lbs. Lower Mandible Protection Device The lower mandible protection device shall provide ballistic protection equal to that of the current LWH.  The lower mandible protection device is intended to integrate with the face shield defined above.  The device shall be easily removed by the user as desired without requiring a special tool.  The lower mandible protection device shall not interfere with the ability of a Marine to properly sight and employ individual and crew served weapons affixed with current and future optics, aiming devices, and head-mounted optics.  The weight of the lower mandible protection device shall not exceed 0.3 lbs. USMC Optics Mount The optics mount shall provide a universal mount for current and future USMC optics in a stable location on the helmet that ensures the users ability to effectively employ the given optic.  Current optics mounts do not adequately address the stability needed for night vision goggles.  The mount is not currently employed in an optimal location on the helmet.  The desired mount should be in a location that does not shift the center of gravity for the helmet and provides stability to the night vision goggles.  ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION PHASES A block acquisition approach is anticipated.   Block I of the HBIS will address the near-term solution of an attachment system to provide mounting points for additional components, and a face shield to provide additional ballistic protection for the face.   Block II of the HBIS will address the addition of a lower mandible protector to provide blast and fragmentation protection to the lower part of the face. Block III of the HBIS will address the addition of a universal night observation device mount to be compatible with current and future USMC optics. Block IV of the HBIS will address the addition of other desired components to the attachment system, including a hands-free light, illuminators, and ear phones.   INDUSTRY DAY MARCORSYSCOM will host a Headborne Systems Integration Industry Conference from 23-24 May 2007, at Kalman & Company Inc., 50 Tech Parkway, Stafford, Virginia, 22556. The conference will commence at 0800 on 23 May 2007 with a MARCORSYSCOM overview of current program goals, capability needs, constraints, other information, and answers to relevant questions or concerns.

<DESC>This is an update to the Request for Information (RFI) and Sources Sought Synopsis posted on 1 February 2007 (Reference Number SMC-07-0001).  The Global Positioning Systems Wing (GPSW), Los Angeles AFB, has a requirement for Defense Advanced GPS Receivers (DAGRs) or equivalent.  At this time, the Government is anticipating a Sole Source Follow-On Contract with an estimated RFP release in fourth quarter FY07.  The probable ordering period will begin second quarter FY08 and extend through FY16, with a potential contract value of $650M.  The purpose of this notice is to determine if there are existing products that meet the requirements of the DAGR Specification, SS-M/V-600B.  For the DAGR Follow-on RFP, the GPS Wing anticipates a new specification, version SS-M/V-600C, which includes updates to reference documents and incorporates Specification Change Notices (SCNs).  Most importantly are the features related to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM).  Equal products (DAGR and accessories), shall provide the capabilities of the current DAGR, to include, but not limited to: worldwide positioning and navigation through continuous tracking of all satellites in view, direct Y- code acquisition, SAASM architecture unclassified-when-keyed operation and updated security features, upgradeable capabilities; and be interoperable with the PLGR/DAGR.  Performance and interface requirements are also contained in the DAGR Specification.  The current DAGR is manufactured by Rockwell Collins Inc.  Potential bidders may obtain access to the current specification and reference documents under the BIDDERS-DAGR-FOLLOW-ON repository through the online GPS Wing Program Library (includes Bidders Library) by contacting Lonetta Demings at gpslibrary@losangeles.af.mil or telephone at (310) 653-3208 or Capt Bryan Hogan at Bryan.Hogan@losangeles.af.mil, telephone (310) 653-3120.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Note:
The Department of Defense (DoD) recently mandated the PKI infrastructure requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to authenticate users via digital identification certificates, rather than the common User ID and Password.

As of 1 August 2006, before accessing the GPS Wing Program Library system each user must have at least one of the following PKI components:

DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or
DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html

Planned Contract Format:
(a) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract with option CLINs for DAGRs plus warranty and accessories.  Customers differ in their choice of accessories ordered with their DAGRs.   The following list is often ordered on a one to one ratio with DAGRs: RA-1 Antenna, DAGR to RA-1 Cable, Installation Mount, DAGR to External Power Cable, DAGR to DAGR/PLGR Cable, DAGR to PC Cable, Personnel Case, Computer Based Training (CBT), O&M Manual and Pocket Guide. (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)  The current DAGR contract includes 39 different accessories as part of an ongoing commitment to customer requirements.   The RFP may include a modification to existing accessories and/or the potential for new accessories.  

(b) Two production order options (DAGRs and accessories) are planned each year (approximately January and June), with the flexibility to move that schedule and to place additional orders if each order is valued at $1M or higher (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(c) Technical Services CLIN(s) will be Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) (ref. Attachment 2 - CLIN Examples)
(d) Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) (ref. Attachment 3 - Summary CDRL List)
(e) Integrated Master Plan (IMP), Software Management Plan, Information Assurance Plan, Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), Statement of Work (SOW), and Logistics plans are required as part of any proposal for this effort and will be incorporated in the contract, further description of requirement provided in reference (ref. Attachment 4 - Preliminary Portion of Section L and Attachment 5 - Section B through G clauses)
(f) The Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) portion of the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) is an essential part of the DAGR program.  The P3I plan is designed to improve the DAGR and its' accessories based on user inputs, which are reviewed by the Human Factors Working Group.  A potential P3I activity scheduled to commence in FY08 with an estimated production impact in FY10, is a manufacturing design improvement that utilizes a Single Die Key Data Processor (KDP).  This improvement would require commitment of funds and action on the part of the Government and significant commitment by the DAGR producer.  It is expected that this change would dramatically lower the recurring price of the DAGR by lessening manufacturing cost and risk.  It would also lower operating costs to customers by reducing power requirements for DAGR operation.  The Follow-On RFP will include a description of this P3I effort.  Offerors will provide an optional pricing table for the DAGR, contingent upon successful completion of this P3I. 

Price:
(a) Target price for DAGR (including 5 year warranty) must be less than $2,000/unit.
(b) Variable quantity pricing tables for the DAGR, accessories, and drawing packages is required (ref. Attachment 6 - Variable Quantity Pricing Table Example)

Schedule:
(a) DAGR Follow-on effort may result in a contract award with options to be exercised at a later date 
(b) Exercise of the first option hardware CLIN(s) is expected in the second quarter of FY08 (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(c) Delivery of DAGRs and accessories must start within 6 months after receipt of order (ARO) and be completed within 18 months after commencement of deliveries (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC - H007)

Additional program requirements are listed below:

Manufacturing capability: 
(a) Proven manufacturing capability (complexity, quality and volume) of same/similar product

<SUBJECT>B -- Intent to Sole Souce UCLA Center for Health Policy Research
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:

ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, CENTER FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY, AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ), THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH, 10960 WILSHIRE BOULEVARD, SUITE 1550, LOS ANGELES, CA  90024. THE PURPOSE IS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY ACT OF 1999. THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING AN ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS REGARDING PREVAILING DISPARITIES IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AS IT RELATES TO RACIAL FACTORS AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS IN PRIORITY POPULATIONS. TO HELP FILL THESE GAPS AND INCLUDE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PRIORITY POPULATIONS IN NHDR, AHRQ STAFF EXAMINED A NUMBER OF STATE HEALTHCARE DATATBASES. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (CHIS) WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE ONLY STATE HEALTHCARE DATABASE THAT HAS THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT MANY OF THESE POPULATIONS. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE SUPPORTING RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS REGARDING HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES HISTORICALLY NOT DOCUMENTED ON PRIORITY POPULATIONS.

TO WRITE THE 2003 NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES REPORT (NHDR), AHRQ STAFF EXAMINED A VARIETY OF NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DATABASES. WHILE NATIONAL DATABASES CAN MEASURE DISPARITIES AMONG MOST PRIORITY POPULATIONS, A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS ARE NOTED. SPECIFICALLY, NATIONAL DATABASES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT PACIFIC ISLANDERS, AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES, ASIAN SUBPOPULATIONS, AND MANY HISPANC SUBPOPULATIONS WITH DESIRED PRECISION. IN ADDITION, AMONG POPULATIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, NATIONAL DATABASES ARE GENERALLY UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH INDIVIDUALS WITH AND WITHOUT LANGUAGE BARRIERS.

THE 2001 CHIS DATA WAS INCLUDED IN THE 2003 NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES REPORT. CHIS CONTINUES TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF HEALTHCARE DATA FOR PACIFIC ISLANDERS, AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES, ASIAN SUBPOPULATIONS, AND MANY HISPANC SUBPOPULATIONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AND NOW HAS AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS OF DATA AVAILABLE. THE 2007 NHDR WILL UPDATE THE PREVIOUSLY USED DATA TO INCLUDE THE 2003 AND 2005 CHIS DATA AND CONSIDER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL MEASURES AND ANAYSES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NHDR. THE 2007 NHDR WILL USE THE CHIS DATA TO SHOW MEASURES AND ANALYSES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NHDR. THE 2007 NHDR WILL USE THE CHIS DATA TO SHOW TRENDS OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND DISPARITIES FOR THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC SUBPOPULATIONS FROM 2001-2005. 


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO NEGOTIATE, UNDER FAR PART 12, WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE. BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS OF CHIS DATA WILL NECESSARILY INCLUDE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE CHIS PUBLIC-USE FILES, THE DATA MUST BE ANALYZED IN THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH'S DATA. DUE TO THIS RESTRICTION, THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH IS THE SOLE SOURCE IN PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Notice of Intent to Purchase from a Sole Source
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to Purchase from a Sole Source for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only Notification.  Notification No. AG-518P-N-07-AA06 is being issued as a Notice of Intent to Purchase from a Sole Source.  This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 334516.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  The equipment must meet or exceed the following statement of work and minimum specifications (brand name or equal).  Statement of Work:  USDA/ARS, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL Location has a  need for a portable fluorometer and infrared gas exchange system for taking simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf gas exchange (photosynthesis).  This instrument must be compatible with already existing equipment being currently used in our research.  The instrument will be used to monitor soybean responses to varying environment conditions.  The Salient Characteristics are:  1) The CO2 and H2O analyzers should be located in the sensor head of the machine to provide rapid response and eliminate time delays.  2) We request an absolute, open path, non-dispersive infrared CO2 gas analyzer with a range of 0-3000 micro mol per mol -1 and bandwidth of 10 Hz.  Maximum deviation should not exceed plus or minus 5 micro mol per mol -1 from 0 to 1500 micro mol per mol -1 plus or minus 10 micro mol per mol from 1500 to 3000 micro mol per mol -1. 3) The operating temperature range should be from 0 Degrees C to 50 Degrees C.  4) The air flow should range from 0 to 700 micro mol per mol per second 6400-01 CO2 injector.  5) An external light source should be incorporated on the instrument. We request a clear chamber head, a red-blue light source that will allow for a relatively large leaf area to be enclosed for gas exchange measurements (6sq and 5sq) a leaf Chamber Fluorometer (LCF) that acts as both a leaf cuvette and as a light source/pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer for simultaneous measurement of gas exchange and fluorescence.  
Sole Source Justification is as follows:  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:   USDA/ARS/MWA, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL Location 1) DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:   USDA/ARS/MWA, Photosynthesis Research Unit has a requirement for a portable Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Gas Exchange System which should be compatible with existing equipment already in use.2) DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:   A portable fluorometer and infrared gas exchange system for taking simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence  and leaf gas exchange (photosynthesis) is required.  The best instrument to fill this requirement has been determined to be the Li-Cor 6400, brand name or equal.  This Notice of Intention to purchase a sole source instrument is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisitions Regulations as listed below. 3) AUTHORITY CITED   FAR Part 6.302-(ii) (A) and FAR Part 5.102-4) REASONS FOR AUTHORITY CITED   - Full text may be found at http://www.acquisition.gov/far/loadmainre.html.  FAR Part 6.302 (ii)  Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract or the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. 5) EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  Like instruments purchased previously have come from the same vendor. Efforts to obtain competitive quotes have been unsuccessful.  We have determined that almost all research in this particular field is being conducted using the Li-Cor instruments as specified above. 6) FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION.  The Li-6400 is the best instrument available in this field.  Use of any other instrument could result in additional costs for repairs, replacement parts and could result in loss of integrity of the research currently being conducted. 7) MARKET RESEARCH:  Efforts in the past to obtain like instruments have not resulted in any offers from competitors.  Other items available for conducting research of this type did not meet the minimum specifications requirements  New instruments need to be compatible with existing equipment.  8) OTHER SUPPORTING FACTORS: Exhibit C below 9) INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A  Exhibit 7C(ii)  Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Checklist  A)  All justifications should  contain:   1) Information based on substantial facts.  USDA/ARS/MWA, Urbana, IL Location has a requirement for a portable Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Gas Exchange System.  2) Clear and complete discussion of reasons why competitive quotations are not practical.  Li-Cor instruments are currently being used in our research.  Compatible equipment is required to insure the integrity of the research. 3) Sufficient explanation to allow a person without technical competence in the area to follow the rationale:  Additional costs incurred to solicit competitive quotes would not be cost effective to the Government. 4) Facilities or specialized equipment:  Laboratory and field experimental facilities used for conducting Agricultural Research. 5) Availability of technical data and other information:  LI-6400R Fluorescence Gas and Exchange System Package including a portable photosynthesis system, CO2 Injector System, Red/Blu LED light source, quantum sensor 8 inch cable, Fluorescence attachment, with accessories as follows:  12 gm CO2 Cylinders, 25.  All responsible parties should submit written (mail or email - no telephone inquiries will be accepted) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice.  It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available.  If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Li-Cor without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<SUBJECT>Y -- INDUSTRY FORUM
<DESC>On April 25, 2007, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Information Forum for interested parties regarding GSAs proposed plan for the Elbert P. Tuttle Court of Appeals Building in Atlanta, Georgia.  This Forum will be held in the Equitable Building, 100 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA  30303 from 10:00am to 12:00pm in the fifth floor conference room.  

The agenda for the Forum will include a presentation of the scope of the design-build contract and an overview of the procurement process for the design-build contract followed by a question and answer period.  Following the Forum, there will be an optional guided walking tour of the buildings to be rehabilitated which are located two blocks from the Equitable Building where the Forum is to be held.

The proposed Tuttle Annex will provide administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The project consists of: 1) the rehabilitation and adaptive use of two existing historic buildings located behind the Tuttle Courthouse in the Fairlie Popular Historic District and 2) new construction of ancillary space including a security screening area, loading dock, solid waste disposal/storage, underground secure parking, and a pedestrian tunnel between the annex and the existing Tuttle Courthouse.  The area of the two existing historic buildings to be rehabilitated is approximately 123,000 gsf, while the area of new construction totals approximately 11,000 gsf for a total project area of approximately 134,000 gsf.  


General construction, design-build, A/E, and other subcontractor and consulting firms capable of providing or teaming with other firms to provide design-build services will have an opportunity to learn about the project, the process for selecting the design-build contractor, participate in a question and answer session, and tour the existing buildings to be rehabilitated. 

THIS IS NOT AN REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Infectious Disease Diagnostic Kiosk
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Infectious Disease Diagnostic Kiosk

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license a fully-automated diagnostic kiosk for infectious diseases.

Background: In places where there are not enough medical personnel, e.g., forward military bases, deployed aircraft carriers & hospital ships, or even poorly-staffed hospitals during a major epidemic, there is not enough time to make a face-to-face appointment with a physician and to wait for diagnosis from a brick-and-mortar medical lab.  Once an outbreak occurs, the population would amass at these treatment centers, seeking immediate services.

Description:  This technology provides additional capability to outbreak treatment centers and forward military bases in diagnosing individuals for infectious diseases.  These kiosks can be designed to asynchronously process biological samples from as many as a dozen patients at a time.  The current design uses a series of complex molecular assays that include nucleic acid extraction and real-time PCR amplification in a flow-through format.

Advantages:  
?	Rapid diagnosis ?? Reduced feedback time ?? Higher productivity
?	Can diagnose as many as 12 patients at a time ?? Higher productivity
?	Fully-automated & video-networked to remotely stationed physicians ?? Lowers contamination risk to care providers	

Applications:   
?	Forward military bases, deployed aircraft carriers & hospital ships
?	Civilian medical centers for disease control

Intellectual Property:  Portfolio of ten U.S. patent applications

Development Status:  The designs of the diagnostic kiosk and its internal components including the internal diagnostic instrument have been drafted.  Some of these components have been tested, although the entire system has not yet been constructed.  LLNL is looking for a commercial partner to help build a prototype.
	Go to the IPAC website to see diagram of the kiosk design http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/infectiousdiseasediagnostic.php


LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Diagnostic Kiosk technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 150-07

Chemonics International Inc. has been the implementer of RATES for five years and appears to be the only source capable of completing the RATES objectives in a final year of activity. In its last year, the RATES program will:
- Work to strengthen the East African Fine Coffees Association, the East African Grain Council, the East and Southern Africa Dairy Association, and the African Cotton and Textile Industries Federation. Particular focus will be placed on increasing their technical depth, their ability to advocate on behalf of their members, and helping them to attain financial autonomy;

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items; and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NLM-07-111-MJK.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.

It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate for professional Information Technology (IT) services to assist NIH in providing critical enhancements and support for NMS Imaging brand name software previously acquired by NIH to support the NIH System for Executive Records and Correspondence Handling (SERCH) and the NIH Enterprise Ethics System (NEES).  NIH conducted an extensive evaluation of the following alternative approaches in choosing the software platform for SERCH and NEES:  (1) Utilize commercially-available software products, (2) Perform in-house custom development of the required software applications, and (3) Utilize existing software applications developed by other Government agencies.  Following the evaluation of available commercial software products, cost, and system requirements, NIH selected NMS Imaging (formally National Micrographics Systems), 12041 Bournefield Way, Silver Spring, MD 20904 to provide its commercial products (including proprietary support services) as the software platform for both NIH enterprise systems.   

In 2003 NIH began developing SERCH as an integrated system to serve the NIH Executive Secretariat needs for records management and executive correspondence handling.  SERCH operates on NMS brand name software that enables document management, workflow, full text searching, format conversion, digital signatures, and records management.  SERCH represents the integration of 15 software applications across 22 servers.  The contractor will be required to review the SERCH process maps, work queues, permissions and integration between the 15 software applications.  To accomplish the work requirements for SERCH, NIH estimates that a total of 1,000 labor hours will be required during a 12-month period beginning approximately June 1, 2007, and 1,000 labor hours during one successive 12-month option period.   NIH estimates that the effort will require expertise from the following labor categories:  Senior Systems Design Engineer, Systems Design Engineer Manager, and Executive Project Manager.  

In 2005 NIH began developing NEES as a secure web-based workflow management system using the NMS Imaging brand name software platform to support the NIH Ethics Program that assists NIH staff with meeting the required statutes and regulations governing the ethical behavior of Executive Branch employees of the Federal Government.  NEES is a comprehensive automation of the NIH Ethics Program that takes into account various business policies and processes at NIH through the utilization of numerous related applications and data stores.  NIH requires professional IT services to further develop the NMS Imaging software platform for NEES to include the following:  (1) Electronic submission of all ethics-related reports and requests along with supporting documentation; (2) electronic review and approval of all ethics-related reports and requests, along with supporting documentation; and (3) electronic tracking and reporting of all ethics-related reports and requests, submissions, reviews, and approvals as well as other related activities associated with the Ethics Program at NIH.  To accomplish the work requirements for NEES, NIH estimates that a total of 480 labor hours will be required during a 12-month period beginning approximately June 1, 2007, and the following additional effort during three successive 12-month option periods:  Option Period 1 (600 labor hours), Option Period 2 (460 labor hours), and Option Period 3 (320 labor hours).  NIH estimates that the effort to support NEES will require expertise from the same labor categories required by SERCH.  

The purchase order term will be from approximately June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008 followed by three successive 12-month option periods.  The following clauses and provisions cited herein are incorporated by reference into this solicitation and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items (September 2006), and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items (February 2007).  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items (January 1999), also applies with the following three evaluation criteria (listed in descending order of priority) to be included in paragraph (a) of the provision:  (1) Experience and expertise of the proposed staff in providing professional IT services to support integrated Federal enterprise systems similar to SERCH and NEES that utilize NMS Imaging software platforms, (2) Experience and expertise of  the company in providing professional IT services to support integrated Federal enterprise systems similar to SERCH and NEES that utilize NMS Imaging software platforms, and (3) Past performance in supporting Federal enterprise systems that utilized NMS Imaging software.  An award will be made to the offeror who represents the best value to the Government based upon the three technical evaluation criteria that are listed in descending order of priority and, when combined, are more important than price.  Offerors must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items (November 2006), with their offers.  The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items (March 2007), applies to this acquisition as well as the following clauses cited therein:     FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003), and FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer ? Central Contractor Registration (October 2003).  Please contact the contracting office if you have any questions concerning this solicitation.

SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA
The items being offered must be mature commercial off the shelf items with proven field usage.  The source selection will be based on proposals that provide the best value to the Government.  Technical acceptability will be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  To be technically acceptable, the offeror must receive a rating of pass in each of the minimum capability categories described above (see 1  14).  If the product is not technically acceptable, no further proposal evaluation will be conducted.

EVALUATION FACTORS

I.	Past Performance
a.	Quality
b.	Timeliness
c.	Business Professionalism
d.	Customer Satisfaction

II.  Experience
III. Price	
Factors to be evaluated are Past Performance, Experience and Price.  These elements are listed in descending order of importance.  Past Performance and Experience combined are more important than price.  Subfactors under the factor of Past Performance are:  Quality, Timeliness, Business Professionalism, and Customer Satisfaction.  The subfactors are equal in importance.  There are no subfactors under Experience and Price.  
Technical Proposals must include Descriptive Literature to include copies of Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Manuals for products being proposed, and product samples at no cost to the Government.   Contractor is responsible for shipping costs to and from Lakehurst.   Product Samples must be received at Lakehurst no later than 24 April 2007.  Products will be evaluated and compared to the minimum range of capabilities (See No. 1  No. 14 above) to determine technical acceptability.   Matting samples will be returned in as is condition at the contractors request and expense.
For the factor of Experience, each proposal will be assigned a risk assessment rating.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.  Each offeror must identify actual design and assembly of Extreme Light Weight Matting to enable the Government to verify the offerors experience.  In making the determination of experience level, consideration will be given as to whether an offeror has experience in manufacturing matting of similar type and size.
For Past Performance, offerors must provide evidence of proven field usage, and names and phone numbers of recent customers, and prices to previous customers for mat that is identical or similar to those being proposed herein.   Offerors will complete Attachment 1 for three (3) contracts relevant to this procurement.  The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.   Unknown risk is a neutral rating, and will apply to offerors with no past performance in this commodity.  The Government may also consider past performance information that is available from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  
For Price, offerors are requested to separately price their matting and accessories by completing Section B.  Each required accessory (i.e. jack kits, stakes, etc.) should be priced separately.  In addition, offerors must include a commercial price list of their products and accessories with part numbers.  Each offerors price proposal will be evaluated using a quantity of  500 units for each of the five years for matting, and a quantity of 10 units for each of the five years for the accessories.   This quantity represents the most likely quantity to be ordered per year.    

GREATEST VALUE EVALUATION
The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror, conforming to the solicitation determined to represent the best value to the Government cost/price and other factors considered.  The offerors proposal shall be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified, which affect the evaluation factors for award.
Evaluation of an offerors proposal will be based on the information presented in the written proposal along with input obtained from outside sources relevant to past performance.  Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical or schedule commitments may be deemed to be reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence, or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed factors or subfactors, may be used as a basis for eliminating a proposal from further consideration.  
The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offerors methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence to ensure successful performance.  Each Factor will be evaluated and assigned a risk assessment rating.
The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerors best terms.  However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offerors determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

Solicitation CCR-07-0001 is not a small business set aside and will be awarded as a firm fixed-price contract.     

Scope of Work

A.  The Contractor shall be required to conduct a full scope financial audit of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights? (the Commission) annual financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007.  

The audit shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), as specified in the most current version of the GAO?s Government Auditing Standards (GAS), and additional audit requirements of the OMB.  In conducting the audit, the methodology used shall be at a minimum, consistent with the most current version of the GAO/President?s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (GAO/PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM).  Should there be any deviations from the methodology set forth in the FAM, the Contractor must provide documentation to the COTR on a timely basis, demonstrating how the Contractor?s methodology satisfies the requirements of the FAM.  The COTR shall be notified immediately of any significant deviations from the FAM.

B.  With respect to internal control, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the components of internal control and assess the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosure components of the financial statements.  The Contractor shall also obtain an understanding of the components of internal control relating to the existence and completeness assertions relevant to the performance measures included in Management?s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).

With respect to MD&A, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and manner of its presentation in the MD&A of the Reporting Entity is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements. In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall consider this required supplementary information and shall follow the guidelines presented in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants? (AICPA) AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform the procedures described in the AICPA?s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the design of internal controls relating to the existence and completeness assertions over performance measures and determine whether they have been placed in operation, as required by OMB Bulletin 01-02, as amended, or the most current OMB audit guidance.

With respect to Required Supplementary Stewardship Information (RSSI) and Required Supplementary Information (RSI), the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in the AICPA?s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA?s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.
 
With respect to Other Accompanying Information, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in AICPA?s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA?s AU Section 550, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.

C.  As part of the USCCR FY07 Financial Statement Audit, the Contractor shall perform procedures to assess the effectiveness of the information system control environment.  The procedures will focus on evaluating the adequacy of information systems controls over the following GAO?s Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) general control areas:

?	Entity-wide Security Program Planning and Management,
?	Access Controls (including mainframe system logical security and data center physical security),
?	Segregation of Duties (for data center management and operations),
?	Application Software Development and Change Control,
?	System Software Controls and Modification, and
?	Service Continuity.

This work will also be utilized by other USCCR personnel with respect to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responds to questions.
1. If we are planning a conference for GSA under another contract for Washington, DC in September, will we qualify to be able to plan this workshop as part of that contract?

Answer: This workshop may be attached to any conference that will offer an agenda that will seek to attract between 50 to 100 Federal employees--in particular, those who may be interested in telework policies, programs, and practices.

2.  Do you know of other contractors that are planning conferences in Washington, DC in September that this workshop would be attached to?  If so, who are they?

Answer:   We know of two conferences that are planned for September in Washington, DC.  But, this list is by no means all inclusive nor does it represent the only conferences that GSA would consider.  The International Personnel Management Association for Human Resources, Federal Sector, has announced a conference to be held during September 11-12.  The Telework Exchange has announced a conference for September 12.  See number 1 for more information.

3.  Would it be possible to team with another firm that is conducting a conference in Washington, DC in September for the purpose of including this workshop as part of their conference?

Answer: Yes.  See numbers 1 and 2.

4.  What A-V support will be required for this workshop?

Answer: This is to be determined by the agenda and needs of the speakers.  But, at a minimum, the proposal should include a laptop computer for presentations, a projection system, at least three corded microphones, two cordless microphones, and on-site technical support.  Typically, this type of support is offered at facilities that would be suitable in meeting the overall requirement.

5.  Will the workshop be a half-day event?

Answer: Yes.

6.  Why was this not purchased under the GSA Schedule 541-4D?

Answer: Contracting Officer?s decision. 
7. How are these services currently being performed? Under contract? In-house?
Answer: These services are not being currently being performed.

8. If these requirements are currently being performed under a contract,
a.	Who is the Contractor?
b.	What is the contract number?

Answer: Not applicable.  See answer to question 7.

9.  Is there an incumbent contractor? 

Answer: Yes.
 
10. Is the contractor responsible for planning both the annual conference and the Federal Interagency Telework Workshop, or simply the latter?

Answer: Both.  
 
11. What is the duration of the annual conference?

Answer: To be determined by the contractor, but at least one full day.
 
12. What is the length of the Federal Interagency Telework Workshop?

Answer: See answer to number 5.
 
13. Will a meeting room be needed in addition to the general session room?

Answer: It is incumbent upon the contractor to determine if an additional meeting room is necessary.  The workshop can be held in the same room as the general session upon conclusion of the general conference session.  But, to ensure a proper set-up for lunch, this may be difficult to do.  The workshop cannot be conducted concurrently with other conference activities.

14. Please confirm that a block of rooms will not be required for the conference/workshop.

Answer: A meeting room (or rooms) will be required for the conference plenary session and for the workshop.  See number 13 for more information.  Sleeping rooms are not required.

15. Will any additional audio-video equipment be required beyond the standard LCD projector/screen, podium, and head table microphones?
 
Answer: See answer to number 4.

16. Who comprises the target audience for the annual conference besides Federal employees?  Will GSA provide an invitation/prospect list for the conference?

Answer: The contractor determines the audience for the overall conference.  But, the program must be such as to attract between 50 to 100 Federal employees.  GSA will invite a Federal audience, who is interested in telework, to the general conference and workshop.  The workshop audience will be comprised of mostly Federal employees and a few private entities and local government representatives who work with Federal agencies on telework.  GSA will have sole discretion for determining who is allowed to register for the workshop.  But, the registration for the workshop must be performed by the contractor and occur concurrently with registration for the overall conference.

17. For budgeting purposes, what requirements does the conference have for promotional efforts, e.g. how many different types of outreach, etc.?

Answer: To be determined by the contractor.  See number 16 for additional information.
 
18. How many exhibitors are expected for the 2007 conference?

Answer: To be determined by the contractor, but the contractor is required to provide exhibit space for GSA and the Washington Metropolitan Telework Centers as a part of this GSA contract.
 
19. Are the conference and workshop costs such as meeting room rental, audiovisual and food and beverage costs, etc. to be paid solely through collected registration funds?

Answer: The cost of the conference should be paid by sponsorships, registration fees,  exhibitor fees, and an amount from GSA, to be included from this contract.  The workshop expenses are to be covered by GSA as a part of this contract.  The contractor may not charge an additional fee for registration for the workshop.

20. What was the registration fee for last year?s conference and how many attendees were present?
 
Answer: That information can only be provided through the Freedom of Information Act Office.  The procedure can be obtained from GSA website. 

21. For budgeting purposes, what (if any) is the anticipated honorarium for each speaker?  

Answer: Free registration to the conference, value to be determined by the contractor.
 
22. Will the contractor be expected to provide travel support to speakers (including per diem)? 

Answer: No.
 
23. Is there an over-arching topic or theme that this year?s conference/ workshop will be focused on?

Answer: The conference theme may be determined by the contractor, but is subject to GSA approval.  The workshop theme will be determined by the expert telework consultant in concert with GSA, but GSA retains the right for sole approval of the agenda.

24. Should the contractor coordinate the annual conference or just the 1/2
day workshop portion?

Answer: Both.

25.  Does GSA or OPM have an expert telework consultant identified already? 
If not, will an expert be recommended?

Answer: GSA has not identified an expert telework consultant for this requirement.  GSA is familiar with recognized, expert telework consultants, but the contractor needs to propose the expert telework consultant as part of the proposal.

26.  How many meeting rooms will be needed?

Answer: To be determined by the contractor, but the workshop will need only one room.

27. What audiovisual equipment is anticipated?

Answer: See numbers 4 and 15.

28.  What type of promotional materials and printing should be assumed for
budgeting purposes?

Answer: Promotional materials are to be determined by the contractor.  GSA will publicize the conference and workshop via its telework listservs.  The contractor is responsible for the reproduction of any handout material, as mutually agreed upon by the contractor, speakers, and GSA.  Examples of handout materials  include: an agenda for the workshop, copies of PowerPoint presentations, biographical sketches, etc.  The contractor is also responsible for any on-site signage to assist participants in locating certain key areas, such as:  Conference Registration, Rest Rooms, Workshop, Plenary Session, etc.

29.  How many exhibitors should we assume?
 
Answer: See number 18. 

30.  Will there be an exhibitor registration fee?

Answer: To be determined by the contractor.  Also, see number 18.

31.  Should the registration costs offset the cost of direct labor and ODCs?

Answer: See number 19.

32.  Are morning and afternoon refreshments required?

Answer: The contractor must provide lunch.  In the past, refreshments for the morning and afternoon breaks have been provided.  In the past, the workshop was held in the afternoon and ?desert? was served for the afternoon break, instead of at lunch. 

33.  Is there a cap on the proposed registration fee?

Answer: The registration fee for Federal employees and others who GSA invites to the workshop should not exceed $300 for a one-day program or $500 for a two-day program.  But, it should be in the interest of the contractor to make the registration fee as low as possible in order to attract between 50 to 100 Federal employees.  Federal training budgets are typically very limited and most agencies are continuing to budget within limitations imposed during Fiscal Year 2006.
