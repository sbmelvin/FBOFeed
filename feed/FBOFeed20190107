<DESC><div>This synopsis is issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.203 which prescribes a mandatory requirement for a 15-day pre&#8208;solicitation notification. The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) intent to issue a solicitation for a full-and-open competition with a partial small business set-aside.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The National Highway Institute (NHI) which is part of the FHWA Office of Technical Services (OTS), has a requirement for non-personal services for the development, update, and delivery of instructor-led training (ILT), Web-Based training (WBT), Web-Conference training (WCT), video conference training (VCT), or flipped classroom training, and training using new technologies such as ePubs, mobile apps, virtual world delivery, and gamification as well as the development or update of supplemental materials and services to support training, advance the state of practice, and implement best practices in the subject areas of Asset Management, Construction &amp; Maintenance, and Pavements &amp; Materials.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The NHI&rsquo;s goal is to provide learner-centric instruction optimized for maximum effectiveness, and ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within defined constraints.&nbsp; Part of this process involves developing and updating course materials responsive to the training needs of the target audience, with clearly articulated learning outcomes.&nbsp; The principles of adult learning and Instructional System Designers must be incorporated into the curriculum materials.&nbsp; Classroom training includes a combination of instructional strategies, such as lectures, facilitated discussions, group exercises, case studies, workshops, interactive knowledge checks/responses, field trips, and/or participant presentations.&nbsp; &nbsp;To be truly effective, instructor-led training requires skilled, competent, and credible instructors with relevant, nationwide project level experience.&nbsp; These instructors must be so well versed in their Asset Management, Construction &amp; Maintenance, and/or Pavements &amp; Materials specialty area(s).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Established by Congress in 1970, the National Highway Institute (NHI) is the training and education arm of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). NHI&rsquo;s mission is to provide technical transportation training and associated materials to the surface transportation community. Since 2004, NHI has been authorized by the International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) to award Continuing Education Units (CEU) to participants who successfully complete selected NHI training courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Traditionally, the NHI offered instructor-led training (ILT) within a classroom setting. Sensitive to the time and travel constraints of customers and aware of advances in a wide array of instructional technologies, NHI has dramatically expanded their distance learning offerings. These include WBT, WCT, VCT, flipped classroom training, blended learning, new technologies such as mobile apps and virtual world delivery, and new evolving training delivery platforms.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>NHI delivers its training courses based primarily on demand from customers, thus the number of training sessions delivered is variable and unknown in advance. The NHI website (http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/) provides a listing of current training courses, as well as information on training philosophy, instructor standards, and the NHI Style Guide.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In 2018, these NHI program areas delivered classroom-based instructor-led training to 1,018 participants and web-based training to 2,822 participants. Participation has shown a consistent growth trend since at least 2006, with much of the growth resulting from web-based and web-conference trainings. Instructor led training sessions have had generally steady participation and session ordering during this time with some year-by-year variation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The solicitation and all related documents will be released electronically via the Government Point of Entry (GPE) otherwise known as Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) or www.fbo.gov. As such, no written, telephonic or other type of request for an advance copy of the solicitation will be entertained. Potential offerors are encouraged to register on www.fbo.gov to receive any further information in reference to the subject action inclusive of any announcements, and/or amendments to the solicitation after its release.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The FHWA intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts as a result of the solicitation. The period of performance shall not exceed 60 months from the effective date of the contract. The NAICS Code for this effort is 611430 with a size standard of $11 Million.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. A Request for Proposals (RFP) is anticipated to be published in the near future. Once the RFP is posted, all interested, responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the FHWA.</div>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract to The Boeing Company (TBC) for procurement of Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) to address integration of the High Speed Video Network (HSVN) Digital Recorder (HDVR) as a retrofit replacement for the Upgraded Solid State Recorder (USSR) and Solid State Recorder (SSR). The HDVR will provide cockpit and mission video recording commonality for F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft, and will use a Linux operating system with a customized kernel maintained by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to mitigate future obsolescence.<br /><br />The procurement will be procured under NAICS 336413 (Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing), and is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 USC 2304 (C)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Government is currently not aware of any commercially available alternatives that can meet the cost savings, schedule constraints, and functionality needed, to be a viable alternative to the NRE for the integration of the HDVR. Therefore, NAVAIR has determined that award of this contract to any source other than TBC would result in unacceptable delays to fielding this requirement.<br /><br />This synopsis is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement with sufficient detail that clearly demonstrates the capability to produce the required products no later than 3:00 PM (EST) January 22, 2019 to James Francisco (james.t.francisco@navy.mil).</p>

The availability will include a combination of maintenance, modernization, and repair, and is expected to require a highly capable contractor with substantial facilities, to include a WHIDBEY ISLAND-Class dock landing ship capable pier and dry-dock as well as human resources capable of completing, coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair, and modernization.

Since the production period for this FY19 DSRA is greater than 10 months, this availability will be competed on a coast-wide (East Coast) basis without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement and therefore this procurement will not be set-aside for small business (FAR 19.502-2(b)).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at <span><a href="http://fbo.gov">http://fbo.gov</a> </span>and interested parties must comply with that announcement.

While AI has been an area of active research for more than fifty years, and while some limited military and civilian applications of AI have been in use for several decades, recent advances in algorithms and computer processors, combined with the collection and availability of extremely large data sets, have dramatically expanded the investment by industry in and application of AI systems to problems as varied as Internet search, vehicle autonomy, natural language processing, business intelligence and e-commerce.<br /><br />Submission Instructions and Format: To respond to this request for information, interested parties should submit their packages by Monday 28 January 2019 at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Submissions should address the following specific questions in their response: <br /><br />1. What do you consider to be among the Army battlefield functions and/or applications that could best benefit from the use of AI? Why?<br /><br />2. What are the most significant technical or operational challenges to the Army's use of AI in these functions?<br /><br />3. What are the most significant DoD/Army policy or regulatory barriers for the application of AI technology to these functions? <br /><br />4. What AI related work is being conducted at your institution that would be applicable to these Army battlefield functions?<br /><br />5. What is the technology maturity of these AI applications and what Army funded R&amp;D would be required to allow insertion into an Army acquisition program?<br /><br />6. Have you had success in transitioning any AI technology to the Army or other DoD or federal government agencies in the past? If so, what were they and what were the keys to this success?<br /><br />7. Are there any DoD/Army R&amp;D or acquisition policies that prevent you from working openly and on a mutually beneficial relationship with the Army in transitioning your AI applications to Army projects or programs in the future (e.g., intellectual property protection, return on investment)?<br /><br />Any responses received that are marked "Proprietary" or include any usage restrictions will NOT BE REVIEWED by ASB. Submissions shall be on a CD or a hard copy of the response. The size of the CD submission will be limited to 20 MB. The hard copy format specifications include 12 point font, single-spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches paper, with a 1 inch margin. There is an eight page limit to your submission.<br />All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006, as it provides the baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Development information under paragraph 4-105. Defense Security Service (DSS) Site for the NISPOM is: http://www.dss.mil/isp/fac_clear/download_nispom.html.<br /><br />Only unclassified white papers/CDs must be mailed to the POC listed (see ADDRESSES and FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT). <br /><br />A listing of respondents and whether or not their submission was utilized will be made available for public inspection upon request. Open deliberation by the full committee is anticipated on or about July 19, 2019 in Irvine, CA.

Does your firm have any manufacturing or delivery order processing constraints? If so, please advise what constraints currently exist.<br />7. What do you envision as the major risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate against those mentioned risks?<br />8. Please describe your experience and ability to meet quality and special testing requirements including, not but limited to, Certificate of Quality Compliance, Product Verification Testing, Production Lot Testing, and First Article Testing.<br />9. Indicate your firm's business size.<br />10. What quality assurance processes and test qualification practices does your company employ? Please provide a description of your quality program (ISO 9000, QS-9000, EIA-599, or otherwise)?<br />11. Does your company qualify for a small business sub-category? (i.e., 8A, HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business)<br />12. Would you be willing to enter into a long-term contract? If so, for what period can you support firm-fixed pricing? 5 years? Would you recommend options?<br />13. What type of contract do you consider to be best suited for an effort of this magnitude?<br />14. What is the maximum number of years you would recommend for the total life of the contract?<br />15. What method of price adjustment would you accept? (i.e., Fixed priced option periods)<br />16. If an Industry Day or Pre-Solicitation Conference were scheduled in Richmond, VA, would your firm participate? If Video Teleconferencing (VTC) preferred? Please recommend your preferred communication exchange method.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information for Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) System Production
<SOLNBR>N0002419R5201

<ARCHDATE>02082019
<CONTACT>Sakeena S. Siddiqi, Phone 2027814470, Email sakeena.siddiqi@navy.mil
<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is requesting information regarding United States (US) industry's capabilities and related experience for production of export controlled Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) systems from FY 2023 through FY 2030. The primary efforts include production of the CEC system, comprised of the USG-xB hardware suite and the Signal Data Processor-Sierra (SDP-S) with encryption chip. This effort also includes the integration of the USG-xB and SDP-S, and the production of spares, INCO, and ancillary equipment, as well as associated engineering services. Previously these requirements were two separately competed contracts, one for the production of USG-xB systems and the other for production of the SDP-S.</p>
<p>The CEC system allows cooperating units to share uncorrected sensor data with rapid timing and precision via a data distribution system. This, in turn, provides improved Battle Force Air and Missile Defense by coordinating all ship/air sensor data into a single, real-time, composite track picture supporting integrated fire control. The CEC system is installed aboard US and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) ships, to include cruisers, destroyers, amphibious assault, amphibious transport dock, and aircraft carriers. The CEC system is also installed aboard E-2C and E-2D aircraft.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a majority of the work to be performed at the contractor's site.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>RFI Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>For this RFI, the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) would like to gauge industry interest and capability in build-to-print production of the CEC system and associated engineering efforts, and for industry to identify potential barriers to their participation in a future competitive procurement. For purposes of this RFI, the CEC system is defined as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; US Navy shipboard CEC variant, AN/USG-2B below decks equipment, including Signal Data Processor and Environmental Control System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; FMS shipboard CEC variant, below decks equipment, including Signal Data Processor and Environmental Control System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; US Navy Airborne CEC Variant, AN/USG-3B including End Fire Array, Transceiver and Signal Data Processor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Upgrade and Backfit kits, Spares, INCO-R and INCO-I kits</p>
<p>PEO IWS is interested in the full potential of industry responses including those from small businesses.</p>
<p>The scope of work requires demonstrated experience with the production, integration, assembly, test, design, and logistical support of equipment similar to the CEC System. The CEC system is defined by a Government owned Technical Data Package (TDP). Due to the nature of this requirement, the company will need to demonstrate the required level of technical expertise and the production capability necessary to deliver the fully tested equipment on time to meet shipyard fielding schedules.</p>

<SUBJECT>Intent to Sole Source: Application of GC1295 Urethane to "Dolly" Assemblies
<SOLNBR>N4523A19R1307
<RESPDATE>011719
<CONTACT>Shannon Falconi, Contract Specialist, Phone 3606274365, Email shannon.falconi@navy.mil - Daniel J. Ellis, Contract Officer, Phone 3604764001, Email daniel.ellis@navy.mil
<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS/IMF) require application of GC1295 Urethane for twenty (20) "Dolly" assemblies, which consists of one top plate and one bottom plate per set, bonded together per drawing direction.
<p>It is understood that GC1295 is a proprietary Polyurethane of Gallagher Corporation (GC).</p>
<p>The following exceptions apply to this effort:</p>
<p>1. The tolerance on the thickness of the bottom plates is +/- .015", while on the top plate it is +/- .010". To assist in a consistent finished product, the individual thicknesses of all fifteen top and all fifteen bottom plates will be within +/- .005" of each other while staying within the tolerances given. As an example, if one of the bottom plates is 1.130" thick, the other nineteen should be 1.125" to 1.135". In addition, each plate will have a maximum variation in flatness of .003" overall.<br />2. The finished thickness tolerance of the dolly is given as 3.000 +/- .005 on the drawing, however the parentheses around the number denotes it as a "reference dimension". If the thickness of your urethane is held to 1.125" +/- .015" as shown, whatever the overall thickness (height) results is acceptable. The overall height need not be held to 3.000 "+/- .005 as it would if the tolerance block was utilized.<br />3. A slight convex surface at the edges of the Urethane may exist due to shrinkage. This is an acceptable condition and will not affect function.<br />4. Although not likely, in the event of an assembly does not meet the bubble, void, crack, seam, or crater requirement of the drawing, the Urethane may need to be removed and reapplied on one or two assemblies at most. While removing the Urethane, the possibility exists that the Nedox FM-5 coating could be damaged. If this were to occur on no more that two assemblies, the damaged plates may be returned to PSNS and the coating reapplied at Government expense. Shipping cost from vendor to PSNS will be borne by vendor with return shipping provided at government expense.<br />5. All surfaces of the Top and Bottom plates will be coated with Nedox. Surfaces where the urethane will be applied will have the Nedox removed and prepared for GC-1295 application.</p>
<p>If your company is able to perform the work stated within this posting, please respond to the Primary Point of Contact via email and provide your company's<br />capabilities.</p>

<DESC>The Global Operations Center (GOC) mission serves as the single coordination and synchronization element exercising control of the JDDE to achieve the Commander's intent. The GOC is a unified team of Government supply chain managers, transportation specialists, and logistics planners. It is a Government operations center comparable to a commercial 3rd Party Logistics (3PL) service provider. Led by the USTRANSCOM Operations and Plans Directorate (TCJ3), the GOC includes planners from the TCCs, other directorate staff, and liaison officers from COCOMs, Services, and Agencies. The FC is a dynamic environment which provides a holistic approach to address all requirements from a multimodal view for strategic and operational planning as well as creation of optimal enterprise-wide executable plans. Its goals focus on early collaboration with customers, suppliers and TCCs. In addition, the GOC monitors end-to-end movement of forces; sustainment analysis; supports current and future operations and plans; supports deployment and distribution planning groups, supports cyber defense planning and process improvement efforts; provides multi-modal analysis; exception reporting; knowledge management; and provides agile, adaptive transportation.
<p>The GOC focuses on several broad tenets in order to successfully support the USTRANSCOM mission:<br />&bull; identifying and prioritizing operations information technology requirements<br />&bull; champions joint solution sets to improve C2 and operational processes<br />&bull; capture and document high-level requirement gaps where processes have no automated support<br />&bull; improve operations through the integration of reengineered operations processes and technology; and<br />&bull; maintain the operational functionality of key systems supporting USTRANSCOM Global Operations Center operations.<br /><br />Reference the attached draft PWS for additional information.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS

1. A wall-to-wall inventory, to include items and areas, as follows:

(a) The Contractor shall:  
i) Provide the inventories in a cost effective manner using efficient inventory measurement techniques
ii) Have the ability to provide instant snapshots and on-demand inventory of each designated section once completed.
iii) At the close of inventory day, the Contractor must provide a summary of all inventoried sections, with CD and Excel report to follow within 7 business days
iv) Communicate with local points of contact from each site via email 7 working days prior to arriving at site and providing a contact number for inventory staff to facilitate any last minute changes. 
v) Use Scanners:  State of the art equipment and technology designed to ensure efficiency, accuracy and detail will be required.  This includes proprietary hand-held technology (Mobile Scanning Devices) capable of moving quickly to report inventory progress in real-time.  Offeror must be able to ensure validation of accurate inventories and data collection such as scanning barcodes of drug bottles on the shelves and unit dose packaging, for NDC, UPC, and Mckesson (Prime Vendor) numbers.  Scanners and or computer software must be capable of downloading the VA pricing files containing the same information matching the Prime Vendor, Mckesson for NDC, UPC, and Mckesson numbers, correct pricing, drug description, package size, quantity, and product name. Scanners must have the capability to manually override pricing associated with these numbers in order to capture cost data from direct purchase products and medications.  Scanners must be capable of utilizing Visual Count Technology which enables monitoring of inventory status and data from any web browser or internet connection during time of inventory.  There is no VA sensitive data (PHI/PII) or access to VA systems required.

(b)   Contractor shall have a mechanism to  mark/tag  each area that is to be inventoried, with markers placed at the beginning and end of each section to be counted.  An initial of the person counting the section, should be placed on the marker at the end of the section that has been counted.  This prevents duplication of completed sections when more than one person is working within the same section.

(c) Items in the Inpatient Pharmacies shall be counted, including items in dispensing equipment, including any special Nursing Home pharmacies, if any.  This includes ATC or OS-PAC/Talyst unit dose or other such dispensing machines. The Pharmacy department shall provide the contractor with the data from the dispensing machines so the data can be included within the required reports.

(d) Items in the Outpatient Pharmacies shall be counted, including items in dispensing machines such as Baker APS machines, ScriptPro, Optifill, PharmaPack etc. The Pharmacy department shall provide the contractor with the data from the dispensing machines so the data can be included within the required reports. 

(e) Bulk Intravenous solutions SHALL BE counted accurately, with items being counted based on the total package size of the item and not counted as single items. The contractor shall be provided the pricing data by the Pharmacy department so the data can be included within the required reports.

(f) Opened bottles of medication other than what is used for compounding must be opened and estimated correctly to the nearest tenth (10th) of a bottle.

(g) Contractor will be supplied current cost information from the VA facility in an Excel (or comparable) format.  The contractor must use this to determine the replacement cost of the inventory.  If the product is purchased direct by the facility, the POC must supply the most recent cost.  This inventory must be carefully reviewed to eliminate errors.  A preliminary report will be viewed prior to the completion of inventory and any and all corrections must be made prior to the contractor leaving the premises.  A random check of at least 25 items per section must be done to ensure that the inventory was completely accurate and provided immediately to local pharmacy staff.  VA personnel will conduct a spot check of items to ensure compliance to accuracy.  A Section by Section inventory sheet must be printed out by the Contractor after scanning each section for Pharmacy staff to review for accuracy and correctness. 

(h)  The contractor must provide accurate reports and data with no more than a one percent error rate. (Price, package size, quantity, and product name)  Verification of counts and designated areas inspected by VA staff will be checked and verified with the contractor the day of inventory performed and any corrections made prior to contractor leaving the facility.  If it is determined that there is greater than a one percent error rate in the entire inventory for each assigned facility, the offerer must either return to re-do the inventory within a two week period or pay a 20%  penalty for the inventory charge for that facility. 

(i) Unit dose PRE-PACKED items SHALL be counted utilizing NDC, UPC, and McKesson numbers. (these are individual doses or small strip-packages of individual doses).

(j) Items in the Emergency Pharmaceutical Cache SHALL NOT be counted.

(k) Non-McKesson Direct Purchases and Prosthetic items in unopened containers with a cost over $100.00 SHALL BE counted and the pricing data shall be provided by the respective facility.  Items in question could be located in either the Inpatient or Outpatient Pharmacy locations only.  Contractor shall be able to manually override or add price information utilizing NDC, UPC, and McKesson information. In the case of supply items, where there is no McKesson date, NDC, and/or UPC, Contractor must be able to manually add both description of product and pricing to the inventory list. This must be completed BEFORE leaving the site, and included on the list left with VA Pharmacy personnel on the day of inventory.

(l)  Controlled substances shall be counted by the Pharmacy personnel only.  However, the contractor shall be provided the data (Drug name, NDC, Item Number, pack size, inventory count) by the Pharmacy department so the data can be included within the required reports. 

(m)  Contractor shall provide a sufficient number of inventory specialists to complete each facility inventory within an 8-hour business day.  Staffing calculations shall be based on size / complexity of each facility and the dollar amount of total inventory for each site.  All assigned Staff must show up on time based on the scheduled time of each facility.
The complete inventory of all sections of a site must be completed within one business day. This includes the time taken to review section lists, make any corrections, and print final reports.   A business day is defined as an 8 hour period of time to start no earlier than 6:00 am and generally end no later than 5:00 pm, preferred start and end times are listed for each site in ATTACHMENT 3.  Once the schedule is approved and included in the award document it is normally not possible for the VA to accommodate any changes to the schedule as our staffing requirements have already been finalized. 
(n)  Contractor shall provide a database with the correct NDC, UPC and McKesson number drug format which matches the prime vendor s (McKesson) drug database, which in turn links pharmacy drug inventory to the correct VA contract pricing.  It is expected that prices in this database shall be current and accurate.  The Contractor shall furnish scanning devices, preloaded with current, accurate price data, as of December 2018 (preferably between 12/15/18 and 12/31/18), from the prime vendor (McKesson) data base prior to arrival.

(o)   Contractor provides a mechanism for  whole quantity  counts per unit, instead of the  tenths  required by the VA handbook, on partial bottle for higher costing drugs (e.g, chemotherapy, AIDS drugs), over $5.00 per unit, thus providing a more accurate inventory total.

(p)  Contractor shall provide a detailed inventory by section (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, etc.), once the section has been completed.  All reports shall be reviewed by the contractor and a pharmacy staff person for each counter, to insure accuracy of inventory.  Any recounts or extra printouts can be requested for review by VA personnel.

(q)   Close-out, balancing, wrap-up: shall verify that all recounts have been done and all adjustments have been completed, before the Contractor leaves within the 8 hour work day. Pharmacy staff shall check all inventory locations and verify visually that every area has been counted and inventory tags/markers have been removed.

(r)   The Contractor and the Contractor s personnel shall adhere to all VA Security, Privacy and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements.  No later than five (5) work days prior to beginning performance the Contractor shall submit the list of the names of all employees who will perform the inventory at all locations to the Contracting Officer.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient evidence to support the qualifications of the personnel anticipated to provide services.  Contractor employees shall be citizens of the United States, performing work in the 48 contiguous states, and have had appropriate inventory training experience, supported by Certificated or Resumes, presented as part of the Contract package.  The contractor who is awarded the contract must provide proof of liability insurance; workers compensation insurance and these documents must be submitted prior to award.  Employees shall have passed a recent drug-screening test.  There is no VA sensitive data (PHI/PII) or access to VA systems required.

 (s)  The Contractor shall be bonded and insured.

2.  Reporting Results:
A preliminary report, separated out by section, for each pharmacy inventoried (total #3) shall be left onsite at the completion of the inventory, with the final report being supplied within at least seven (7) business days of the inventory.  Each report shall contain all items inventoried with the following data: Item name (name & strength, i.e., Ativan 1mg/1ml), package description (ml, bottle, tab), NDC and UPC/UPN, total quantity, current package price, package size, and total replacement cost per item, and total replacement cost of all items.  (Upon completion, preferably there will be available 1) a single document that merges all inventoried sections into a single report with one line per item and 2) a document that subtotals the inventory for each section of the pharmacy.  If this report is not available on the day the inventory is completed, it should be provided within seven [7] days.)   The report must be provided in a format that is compatible with or easily transferable to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft office 2010 or greater version).  The reports shall be on CD or sent as an e-mail attachment to the Chief of Pharmacy Services and local pharmacy point of contact (see site preferences)

3. The VA facility will be responsible for:
(1) Having knowledgeable person(s) available during the inventory to answer questions, assist with data that may be necessary to complete the inventory of non-prime vendor items, to assist with printing the final inventory report on site, and for a general review of the final report.
(2) Providing inventories of items in automated dispensing machines and controlled substances, as outlined above, so that these inventories can be added by the vendor to the final counts.

4.  The contracting officer is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract.  The Contractor shall communicate with the Contracting Officer on all matters pertaining to contract administration.   Only the Contracting Officer is authorized to make commitments or issue changes, which will affect price, quantity, or quality of performance of this contract.  In the event the contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the contracting officer, the change shall be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for SDL software in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to SDL XyEnterprise LLC.  Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: SDL XyEnterprise LLC. Lt Col Brian Miller has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.</p>

<DESC>Soldier Protection System Torso and Extremity Protection Ballistic Combat Shirt - Request for Information
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research purposes only. All questions relating to this notice shall be sent via email to Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) point of contact (POC) John Harvey.</p>
<p>ACC-APG, on behalf of Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060, is seeking information from potential industry partners to support the Army's effort to produce the Ballistic Combat Shirt (BCS).</p>
<p>Background: A validated requirement exists to provide the Soldier a personal protective system that allows the user to tailor his/her loads for mission-specific operations, thereby increasing survivability and mobility. The BCS is part of the Soldier Protection System Torso and Extremity Protection (SPS TEP). The SPS TEP design consists of four (4) components: BCS, Modular Scalable Vest (MSV), Blast Pelvic Protector (BPP), and Ballistic Battle Belt (B3). The goal of the SPS TEP is to provide the Soldiers with modular and scalable/mission-tailorable protection to reduce weight and increase mobility while optimizing protection. The SPS TEP allows Soldiers to tailor their protection from Tier 1, Concealable, to Tier 4, Full Tactical. The Government BCS design is intended to function as an armored Army Combat Shirt (ACS). The non-ballistic materials used in the torso and sleeves are equal to the ACS in weight and functional characteristics, including flame resistance and moisture wicking. The deltoid and upper thoracic portions of the BCS contain soft armor that provides protection from fragmenting munitions. The deltoid portion of the BCS utilizes three (3) separate ballistic inserts that are layered to form an articulating shoulder that does not impede the normal upward motion of the arm at the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>This RFI is to gather information specific to producing the BCS. Currently the Government has a valid requirement for at least 1,060,000 BCSs that will be produced as part of the follow-on five (5) year multi-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. Specifically, this RFI seeks information on the construction of and production capabilities related to the BCS. The BCS shall meet the Material Systems Requirement and Performance Requirement of the BCS Purchase Description (PD), AR/PD 15-06 Rev C, Amendment 1 dated 21 August 2018 (attachment).

<SOLNBR>89303519CNE000005
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Nuclear Energy Oak Ridge Site Office (NE-ORSO) of the Department of Energy (DOE) plans to contract with American Centrifuge Operating LLC (ACO), a subsidiary of Centrus Energy Corp., for the demonstration of high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) production to support DOE research and development activities and programs.  The HALEU Demonstration Program has two primary objectives: (1) Deployment of a 16 machine AC-100M HALEU Cascade producing a 19.75% U-235 enriched product by October 2020; and (2) Demonstration of the capability to produce HALEU with existing U.S.-origin enrichment technology, and provide DOE with a small quantity of HALEU beginning in 2020 for use in its research and development for the advancement of civilian nuclear energy and security, and other programmatic missions. The period of performance for this award is anticipated to be January 2019 ? December 2020 with a one year option.
ACO is the only source capable of executing the contract activities to meet the requirements of the HALEU Demonstration Program. DOE?s objective is to demonstrate the capability to produce HALEU by October 2020 utilizing U.S.-origin uranium enrichment technology.  The use of existing U.S.-origin enrichment technology is needed in order to meet this schedule.  Demonstrating the capability of U.S.-origin enrichment technology for the production of HALEU is the objective because only U.S.-origin technology would be capable of producing HALEU for use in any type of advanced reactor application, civilian or defense-related. The AC-100M enrichment technology is the only existing U.S.-origin uranium enrichment technology, and, further, has the potential to be deployed at a commercial-scale serving the broadest market need.  In addition, due to the sensitive nature regarding access to and operation of U.S.-origin enrichment technology, the Department requires the contractor to be a U.S.-owne d and U.S.-controlled entity.  ACO, as well as Centrus Energy Corp., are U.S.-owned and U.S.-controlled entities. Further, ACO is the only U.S.-owned and -controlled entity with an existing NRC license that would enable it to meet DOE?s schedule for the demonstration, and ACO is currently subleasing DOE?s facility in Piketon, Ohio designed for uranium enrichment operations.  ACO is in this unique position because it developed the AC-100M centrifuge and associated equipment; it possesses proprietary data associated with advanced designs related to that technology; and it has demonstrated technical expertise in operating the AC-100M equipment and technology. In sum, ACO is the only U.S.-owned and -controlled entity capable at this time to demonstrate and operate the only existing U.S.-origin uranium enrichment technology on the required schedule. Therefore, DOE intends to award a sole source contract to ACO. 
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
This is a NOTICE OF INTENT; no solicitation is available for this requirement. If an interested firm believes that it has the capability to perform this work within the schedule described above, then it may submit a capability statement NO LATER THAN January 22, 2019, by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) via e-mail to Karen.Shears@orem.doe.gov. The written response must include demonstration of the firm?s capability to perform the services indicated in this announcement, including demonstration of capability to obtain access to AC-100M enrichment technology in accordance with 10 CFR Part 725, evidence of  the firm?s ownership and control, and past performance information for similar work.
A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0M.</p>
<p>Lipid droplets are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles that serve as lipid storage within cells and play important roles in cell signaling. Lipid droplets may form as a response to elevated fatty acids and ER stress. The hallmarks of ER stress include the accumulation of misfolded proteins and likely, toxic lipid species in the ER. ER stress implicated in many disease processes, including endometrial carcinogenesis. However, the most commonly assayed marker of ER stress (a protein called GRP78) is inconsistently associated with endometrial cancer prognosis and has not been studied across histologic subtypes. No studies have determined whether lipid droplet accumulation could better characterize the role of ER stress or provide prognostic information in the context of this cancer (e.g., beyond the information that expression of tumor protein p53 provides). Indeed, no studies have purposely quantified lipid droplet accumulation in endometrial cancers and to do so, NCI will be adapting a protocol for lipid droplet staining that was developed in muscle and liver tissue.</p>
<p>The proposed study uses 20 endometrial carcinoma specimens and at least one control specimen (e.g., normal postmenopausal endometrium) collected via biopsy in the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCU). NCI will evaluate lipid droplet accumulation and expression of proteins GRP78 and p53 in these tissues.  The purpose of this study is to determine if lipid droplets can be quantified in endometrial tumors and if this can be done with simple staining techniques and software. This will help establish whether excess neutral lipids can be found in all endometrial cancers, or whether potentially dysregulated lipid metabolism is a hallmark of specific histologic subtypes. Secondarily, NCI is seeking to identify factors that are correlated with lipid droplet accumulation in endometrial cancers: expression of proteins that are linked to various aspects of cellular division control; cancer stage and grade; and patient-level characteristics like body mass index. These analyses will provide information and impetus for future projects on lipid droplet accumulation-for example, those studies exploring the relationship between lipid droplet formation and treatment responses.</p>
<p>The study utilizes endometrial carcinoma specimens collected via biopsy in the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCU); these specimens were histologically typed by pathologists according to clinical standards, have information on FIGO stage of disease, and are linked to medical record information. Information on age and body size from medical records is needed to comment on lipid droplet accumulation across risk factors for endometrial cancer and also to adjust for important confounders. Patients will carefully be selected according our study criteria (e.g., postmenopausal women with demographic information) by VCU. VCU has Institutional Review Board approval to conduct this study using VCU specimens that will be handled and processed at VCU laboratories; and permission to view the medical records to select participants and collect de-identified information. In addition to the demographic information, VCU will mine the medical records for other desirable medical information, as available (e.g., diabetes status, treatment, survival). VCU is the sole source for the samples required for this study and therefore the only known source that can fulfill NCI's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Responses must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM ET, on January 22, 2019.  All responses and questions must be via email to Miguel Diaz, Contracting Officer at miguel.diaz@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification through SAM.GOV and have Representations and Certifications filled out. Reference: 75N91019Q00012 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source award to Silverhawk Aviation Academy, 4505 Aviation Way, Caldwell, ID 83605, to secure an aircraft charter to support airborne topographic mapping of the ESSCE test sites near Boise, Idaho. The aircraft required is a Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter capable of supporting the installation and operation of an external pod-based airborne laser scanning system. There must be connection points on the aircraft right skid and fuselage for mounting the pod; external GNSS capable Global Positioning System antenna mounting location on the top of the aircraft tail; access to 28VDC power supplied from the aircraft directly from the aircraft battery. The contractor must provide a skilled pilot to fly planned flight lines at required airspeed and altitudes by following guidance from a flight management system visual display. The contractor must provide equipment installation services and removal. The period of performance is 1 February 2019 through 1 April 2019. This procurement action is exercised as sole source under statutory authority set forth under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This Notice of Intent is for information purposes only. The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 611512, Flight Training, with a Small Business Size Standard of $27,500,000.00. This notice of intent is for information purposes only. All sources eligible to provide this requirement must respond in writing.

A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received within 4 calendar days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining this product through a sole source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>GPO is engaged in a system modernization effort for its current print procurement processes and systems. Over time, print procurement processes have evolved to include the use of manual processes (e.g., paper forms) coupled with an existing legacy Mainframe system and client-server applications to accept orders, create specifications, generate bid and award documentation, and otherwise manage this comprehensive print procurement activity. These processes, while useful, have a tendency to introduce inefficiencies (e.g. multiple keying of same data) and errors throughout an order's lifecycle. Also, pertinent information about an order may be unavailable to other processes within the print procurement workflow, which further perpetuates errors.<br /> <br />Additionally, customers have requested the ability to submit, track, and manage order information. Providing this transparency will help to improve customer satisfaction and communications with customers, contractors, and other stakeholders.<br /> <br />The goal of the print procurement systems modernization is to create an integrated approach to automating and streamlining the end-to-end print procurement process from online order submission to vendor payment and customer billing. It will include the technology and business practices to enable GPO to replace, enhance, or integrate current systems and processes currently used in support of the United States Government printing and publishing needs. It will consolidate print procurement operations within a single, modular system, improve work processes, and automate specific functions where applicable. GPO satisfies the majority of the Government's printing needs through print procurement in its Customer Services business unit<br />

<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for Motorola maintenance in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to CDO. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: Thermo Scientific Inc. Lt Col Peter A. Sandness, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Kyle Matranga at (937) 656-7377 or e-mail: Kyle.Matranga@us.af.mil<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Lt Col Peter A. Sandness can be reached at (312) 785-5512, e-mail: peter.sandness@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Abaxis, Inc. for Abaxis Vetscan HM5 Hematology Analyzers with reagent packs and controls. The Abaxis HM5 is a fully-automated hematology analyzer. This unit is easy to use with a small footprint, limited maintenance requirements, and is able to withstand decontamination, making it a widely used platform in containment labs. This unit was designed for use with animal samples and can be run using very small sample sizes, which is imperative for our studies using animals such as mice, where the total blood volume obtained per animal is nominal. This is also the platform being used by the Comparative Medicine Branch in building 23, who we regularly collaborate with.<br />These units will allow us to standardize our BSL-3 and BSL-4 containment research with the data from our colleagues in CMB.. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within seven (7) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to William Brannen at VWL0@cdc.gov by 10:00 A.M. EST, January 14, 2019.</p>

Background. 
 Community Outpatient Services is in need of 2 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) units for the Akron and Parma CBOC Optometry clinics, and a Software update on the current OCT machines. The current OCT machines cannot be updated, and will need to be replaced. The previous model was the Cirrus OCT 4000 and the technology has vastly changed with the newest generation of OCT (Model 5000). The Cirrus OCT 5000 significantly improves upon the 4000 models, providing higher quality scans that will limit scanning errors that can lead to clinical errors, and will also add the ability to acquire high-definition OCT retinal images on the same device, which will improve clinic efficiency. This will significantly improve our facilities ability to manage glaucoma which is highly prevalent in our patient population.  
Furthermore, the CBOCs do not have immediate access to ophthalmology referral services, such as a retinal specialist, so the importance of acquiring high-definition OCT images is vital for making critical diagnoses and referrals.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

REPORTS (JUN 2012)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause—

(1) “Contract financing payment” and “invoice payment” have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(2) “Electronic form” means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests. However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.

(3) “Payment request” means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.

(4) “Receiving report” means the data required by the clause at 252.246-7000, Material Inspection and Receiving Report.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.

(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when—

(1) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer’s determination with each request for payment;

(2) DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System);

(3) DoD makes payment for rendered health care services using the TRICARE Encounter Data System (TEDS) as the electronic format; or

(4) When the Governmentwide commercial purchase card is used as the method of payment, only submission of the receiving report in electronic form is required.

(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.

(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests.

(End of clause)

252.232-7004 DoD Progress Payment Rates.

As prescribed in 232.502-4-70(b), use the following clause:

DOD PROGRESS PAYMENT RATES (OCT 2014)

If the Contractor is a small business concern, the Progress Payments clause of this contract is modified to change each mention of the progress payment rate and liquidation rate (excepting paragraph (k), Limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions) to 90 percent.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>Quotes must be submitted with a completed 52.212-3 Quoter Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items-with DUNS Number Addendum, signed by an authorized representative of the Quoter OR provide a copy of valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The quote must be prepared in three SEPARATE volumes: Volume I - "Technical Volume", Volume II - "Past Performance Volume" and Volume III - "Price/Business Volume". Each of these parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the evaluation of the other. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number should be included on the front cover of each volume.</p>
<p>Your quote must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ and signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt thereof by the Government.</p>
<p>This RFQ does not commit the Government to pay any of the costs associated with the preparation and submission of your quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this requirement. By submitting a quote in response to this solicitation, it is understood that your quote shall become a part of the official contract file.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD<br /><br />The Government intends to make an award to the Quoter whose quotation provides the best overall value to the Government. Selection of a Quoter for award will be based on an evaluation of quotations against four factors. The factors, in order of importance are: technical, personnel requirements and organizational experience, past performance and price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more quoters are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price quote or other than the highest technically rated factor.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The merits of each quote will be evaluated carefully. Each quote must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the quote. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may not be requesting revisions to Quotations, so Quoters should provide their best solution and price in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p>NOTE: Quoters must submit information sufficient to evaluate their quotation based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>
<p>THE EVALUATION PROCESS<br /><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible quoter whose quotation, conforming to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate the prospective Contractors and are listed in order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach <br />2. Personnel Requirements and Organizational Experience <br />3. Past Performance (Acceptable/Unacceptable)<br />4. Price (Price will be evaluated separately but not scored)</p>
<p>&nbsp;TECHNICAL ADJECTIVAL RATINGS</p>
<p>Evaluators will apply the criteria of the following adjectives, (as appropriate to the individual factor being evaluated) as general guidance to be used when rating each of the technical factors listed above and the volume as a whole.</p>
<p>Rating<br />Adjectival Definition</p>
<p>Blue</p>
<p>Excellent The quote contains no deficiencies or only a very few and very minor weaknesses. Based on information provided, there is no doubt that the quote demonstrates an exceptional understanding of the services required to meet or exceed most requirements. The highest quality of performance is anticipated.</p>
<p>Green</p>
<p>Very Good The quote contains no deficiencies and only a few minor weaknesses. Based on the information provided, there is little doubt that the quote demonstrates a high quality of understanding of the services required to meet or exceed some of the requirements.</p>
<p>Yellow <br /><br />Satisfactory The quote contains no deficiencies and some weaknesses. Based on the information provided, the Quote demonstrates an understanding of the services required to meet the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Orange</p>
<p>Poor The quote contains deficiencies and significant weaknesses. Based on information provided, there is doubt that the contractor understands the services required to meet the requirements. Requirement/services can be met only with major changes to the quote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Red <br /><br />Unacceptable The quote has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the requirements; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the government's requirements; failure to meet many personnel requirements in the solicitation. (When applying this adjective to a quote as a whole, the technical quote would have to be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised in order to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Price Quote:</p>
<p>The quoter shall prepare a price quotation that contains all information necessary to allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the price quoted. Specifically, each quote must include the following:</p>
<p>- Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN); <br />- Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number; <br />- Business Size (e.g., small or large)</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach:</p>
<p>The Quoter will be evaluated by the quality and reasonableness of the proposed technical plan as evidence of understanding of the scope, purpose, and complexity of the requirements as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) in enough detail that someone with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject would be able to understand the quoter's ability to perform the work. The proposed technical plan shall demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Shall show evidence of previous work performed for at least three (3) past clients with Becton Dickinson instrumentation, that meets the standards required in the SOW. <br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to provide service by a certified factory-trained Field Service Engineer within 48 hours of the Government's service request.<br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to provide unlimited telephone support, for troubleshooting and onsite training by certified factory-trained technical support engineer and application specialists as stated in the SOW.<br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to re-install software and/or provide updates as needed, at no additional cost to the Government.<br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to perform all repairs and adjustments necessary, using OEM parts to restore the equipment to normal and efficient operating condition.</p>
<p>2. Personnel Requirements and Organizational Experience</p>
<p>The Quoter will be evaluated by the appropriateness and adequacy of the proposed project personnel and organization experience as it relates to the completion of the requirements in the SOW, including the responsibilities and level of effort for all personnel who will be assigned to the contract. Staff as well as their detailed qualifications must be described. The key personnel assigned to this contract shall include: Certified factory-trained service engineers, certified technical support engineers, and application specialists. The Contractor shall provide a copy of the certificate of key personnel that will be performing the work stated in the SOW. Contractor shall also include the following in their quote:</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate knowledge and expertise on servicing and troubleshooting Becton Dickinson instrumentation that meets the standards required in the SOW. <br />&bull; Demonstrate that certified factory-trained personnel have a minimum of three (3) years factory training and experience in the servicing of Becton Dickinson instrumentation that meets the standards required in the SOW.<br />&bull; Demonstrate that all primary service personnel shall have at least one backup Field Service Engineer with at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this purchase order.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance (Acceptable/Unacceptable)</p>
<p>Quoters shall submit the following information as part of their response:</p>
<p>&bull; A list of at least three (3) contracts providing similar services working onsite at the client's facility containing the instrument listed in the SOW completed during the past ten years and all contracts currently in process that are similar in nature to the services requested in the SOW. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local Governments and commercial concerns. Quoters may also submit past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or Sub Contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Quoters that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel. The list of contracts is preferably related to past experience with the Becton Dickinson instrumentation as listed in the SOW, as experience with other instrumentation may be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Quoters shall include the following information for each contract or sub contract:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization<br />2. Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)<br />3. Contract Type<br />4. Total Contract Value<br />5. Description of Requirement<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's and Telephone Number<br />8. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code</p>
<p>&bull; The Quoter shall provide specific past performance information on issues encountered with the same or similar instrumentation mentioned in the SOW; identify applicable contracts; and provide corrective actions taken in order to resolve.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Quoter; other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Quoter. Performance risks are those associated with a Quoter's likelihood of success in performing the requirements as indicated by that Quoter's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an quoter's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the quoter as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the quoter's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the quoter's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the quoter's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the quoter's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the quoter's performance. Quoters with no past performance, or sufficiently positive past performance, will be rated as acceptable.</p>
<p>4. Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Quoter's price for all items/services proposed. The option period will be included as part of the total evaluated price. The Government shall evaluate proposed costs to determine they are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price:</p>
<p>Period of Performance Total Price</p>
<p>Base Period (FFP): tiny_mce_marker_________ <br />Option Period 1 (FFP): tiny_mce_marker_________ <br />Option Period 2 (FFP): tiny_mce_marker_________ <br />Option Period 3 (FFP): tiny_mce_marker_________ <br />Option Period 4 (FFP): tiny_mce_marker_________</p>
<p>Cumulative Total: tiny_mce_marker_________</p>

All email inquiries shall have "Question - Solicitation # 75N91019Q00010" included in the subject line.

<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The<br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

<p>(2) For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:</p>
<p>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Special Publication (SP) 800-171, ``Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations'' (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(D) If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk</p>
<p>and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.</p>
<p>(3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2)<br />of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.</p>
<p>(c) Cyber incident reporting requirement.</p>
<p>(1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and</p>
<p>(ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>

<p>(d) Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center<br />(DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.</p>
<p>(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.</p>
<p>(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>

Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.</p>
<p>(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.</p>
<p>(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable<br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The<br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and</p>
<p>(2) Require subcontractors to--</p>
<p>(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC><p>Description: <br />This constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), for a new indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract for construction, repair, and alteration, with design-build and incidental abatement services. The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Greater Southwest Region 7, Acquisition Management Division is the office soliciting and will administer the resulting contracts.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.219-6, this procurement is set aside exclusively for Small Business concerns.</p>
<p>Performance Location: <br />Counties and parishes within the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (Region 7).</p>
<p>General Description of Scope of Services: <br />This contract is to provide general construction, repair, and alteration, with design-build and incidental abatement services. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 with a size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price multiple award contract. This PBS Region has been organized into thirteen geographic zones. Awards will be staggered by zone, potentially two zones at a time. All work to be acquired under the contracts will be accomplished by the issuance of individual task orders. The individual task orders to be placed under the contracts will range in dollar value from approximately $2,000 to $3,500,000; however, project values will NOT be equally spread over this range, and most projects are expected to be less than $50,000. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for a contract which is primary in only the Small Projects Pool shall be $1,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for a contract which is primary in only the Large Projects Pool shall be $4,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. A contract which is primary in both project pools will have a MOL of $5,000,000 aggregate for all task orders for each annual period of performance, for each contract, for each zone. These contract vehicles may be used by both GSA Regional and Field Office personnel. These contracts will be solicited as one (1) year contracts, with four (4) separate one (1) year option periods, for a total potential contract period not to exceed five (5) years. Facilities covered under the scope of this contract include Government owned and leased facilities in counties or parishes within the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.</p>
<p>Services will be required under these contracts on an as-needed basis up to a single task order limit of $3,500,000. Task orders will be prepared based on defined scopes of work for specific projects, and negotiated and issued as firm-fixed price task orders.</p>
<p>The base IDIQ contracts will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm-fixed price award to the offerors who provide the best value to the Government. Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than total evaluated price. The trade-off process under the best value approach will be used. The technical evaluation factors in descending order of importance are: 1. Past Performance and 2. Hypothetical Projects.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to award up to six (6) IDIQ contracts per zone, to offerors who submit a proposal which will provide the best value to the Government in terms of technical qualifications and price; however, the Government reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts per zone as determined to be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>The Government reserves the right to make award without discussion.</strong> Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors. In addition, offerors are highly encouraged to attend the pre-proposal conference, particularly because it is likely that award will be made without discussion. The Government reserves the right to establish competitive ranges and conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>The solicitation package (offer forms, attachments, clauses, and provisions) is available only electronically on FedBizOpps. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and attachments, and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted at the date and time identified in the solicitation package. All information, amendments, and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted on http://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>In order to participate in this procurement, offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). There is no fee to register for this site. Interested firms are required to submit their annual representations and certifications through the SAM website. User guides and webinars are available under the Help tab. The website for SAM is http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>The solicitation and associated information will be available from the fbo.gov website mentioned above. **No telephone requests or questions will be accepted.** This solicitation is not a sealed bid procurement and there will not be a formal public bid opening. All inquiries must be in writing. All answers will be provided in writing by the stated date and will be available on the aforementioned FBO posting.</p>
<p>Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses.</p>
<p>----------------<br /><br /><strong>AMENDMENT 12</strong></p>
<p>Amendment 12 opens the solicitation for proposals for the Louisiana Zone and the Fort Worth Zone. All documents associated with these two zones are included in Amendment 12 and subsequent amendments which will provide additional information. NO DOCUMENT OR FORM POSTED PRIOR TO AMENDMENT 12 SHOULD BE USED FOR THE LOUISIANA ZONE OR THE FORT WORTH ZONE, except as stated in the solicitation.

Under the provisions of 52.217-8 "Option to extend Services", the government may require continued performance of any services within the limits at the rates specified in the contract. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance shall not exceed 6 months. Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be considered for this procurement. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a size standard of $15,000,000 in average annual receipts.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government desires to procure Storm Water Monitoring Services for Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on a small business set-aside basis, provided (2) two or more qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside. Be advised that the U.S. Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if (2) two or more small businesses do not respond with information to support the set-aside. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price.
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry, FedBizOpps, (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov">https://www.fbo.gov</a>). It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code(s) is: 541620 Environmental Consulting Services, 15.0 Million Dollars.</p>
<p>The Fort Jackson Directorate of Public Works, Environmental Division is responsible for environmental regulatory compliance and oversight on Fort Jackson. Fort Jackson has developed a storm water management program that addresses water quality through a number of regulatory aspects such as construction sites, industrial facilities, public education, and good housekeeping, all of which is documented in a Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP). In addition, Fort Jackson has collected water quality data in response to two Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) impairments in the Gills Creek watershed for dissolved oxygen (DO) and fecal coliform bacteria. Due to the change in preferred indicator bacteria by South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), from fecal coliform bacteria to Escherichia coli (E. coli) for fresh water, the proposed pollutant of concern sampled by Fort Jackson at the representative location within the urbanized area is E. coli.</p>
<p>Attached is a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS)</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>4. Information to help determine if the requirement to provide Storm Water Monitoring services to Fort Jackson, SC., is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, warranties, etc.</p>
<p>5. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>6. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

<CONTACT>Lautzenheiser, Karl
<DESC>DUE TO THE LAPSE IN FUNDING FOR THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, THE SITE VISIT HAS BEEN DELAYED INDEFINITELY. CONTACT FRANK_LEE@FWS.GOV WITH QUESTIONS.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services (CGS) Region 1 has been tasked to solicit for and procure a firm-fixed-price for the construction of new bridges within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge. The base bid item (Pump House Bridge Replacement) is located in Washington County. The optional bid item (Gaston Pedestrian Bridge Replacement) is located in Yamhill County. 

Project is a small business set-aside.  Applicable NAICS code is 237310.  Small business size is defined as $36.5 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  The period of performance for the project is estimated to be around twenty-two (22) months with an end date of October 1, 2020. Project magnitude is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.

Site Visit: For firms interested in attending a site visit, the following tentative dates have been established. Parties can meet on either Wednesday, January 9, 2019 at 10 AM local time or on Wednesday, January 30, 2019 at 10 AM local time at the Gaston City Hall, 116 Front Street, Gaston, OR 97119. If planning on attending one of these site visits, please contact Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov at least a couple days prior to the site visit. There may be a possibility of a site visit on February 6, 2019 at 10 AM local time. An amendment will be issued if any of these tentative dates/times are changed.   

Date for submission of Questions: Contractors should submit any questions on this project directly to Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov by no later than close of business on Friday, February 8, 2019. Questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment directly thereafter.  

The following is an overview of the required tasks. 

Base Bid Item - Pump House Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located east of Gaston in rural unincorporated Washington County, Oregon. The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden pump house bridge and the construction of the new Pump House Bridge (steel girder bridge) approximately 145 feet to the west of the existing bridge. The new bridge will consist of a 20-foot-wide, 91-foot long steel bridge with curb-mounted guardrails on either side supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the new bridge north to SW Gaston Road and a gravel levee access road connecting the new bridge easterly toward the existing pump house.  Access roads will include riprap slope protection and the installation of an access control gate north of the new bridge.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.
 
Optional Bid Item - Gaston Pedestrian Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located in south of Gaston (adjacent to the Gaston Feed Store), in rural unincorporated Washington and Yamhill Counties, Oregon.  The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden bridge and the construction of the new Gaston Pedestrian Bridge in the same location as the existing bridge. The existing bridge once provided pedestrians and vehicles access to the Refuge but currently it no longer provides a safe crossing. The new bridge will consist of an 8-foot-wide, 85-foot-long aluminum truss pedestrian bridge supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the existing dirt access road to the new bridge, and the existing levee will receive a new gravel access to account for the difference in elevations between the new bridge and the existing levee.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.


Basis for award will be "Lowest-Priced, Technically-Acceptable (LPTA)" Source Selection Process. LPTA shall be utilized in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 15.101-2. The lowest priced proposal will be based upon the combined total cost for all bid items. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of an offer meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  There will be two (2) non-cost evaluation factors:  Recent Relevant Experience and Recent Relevant Past Performance.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than `Acceptable' must be achieved for Recent Relevant Experience and Recent Relevant Past Performance.

The Government will first conduct a price analysis to determine fairness, reasonableness and if unbalanced pricing exists. Offerors proposals will then be ranked from the lowest to the highest-priced. The Government will then evaluate the technical proposal of the apparent, lowest-priced offeror. If the apparent, lowest-priced offeror's technical proposal is "Unacceptable" the Government will then evaluate the technical proposal of the apparent, second lowest-priced offeror. This process will continue until a lowest-priced offeror's technical proposal is "Acceptable." 

Once the Government identifies the lowest-priced, technically-acceptable offeror, an award will be made and no other proposals will be evaluated from offerors who proposed higher pricing.  

In determining whether a proposal as technically acceptable, the offeror must submit the following information with their proposal submission for evaluation:

 1. Recent Relevant Experience: Offerors shall be evaluated to determine whether they have performed similar contracts, in terms of scope and price, to the work required within the solicitation.  Offerors shall provide the minimum requested project information on at least one (1) recent, relevant project for a steel girder bridge (ten page limit) and at least three (3) recent relevant projects for driven pile support bridge (ten page limit).  For a project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the Prime Contractor on it.  Projects do not have to have been with a Federal Agency to be considered.

A project is considered `recent' if it has been completed within the past four (4) years or is currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).

A project is considered `relevant' if it is similar in terms of scope and price to the work required within the solicitation.  To be considered similar in scope, one project shall demonstrate work experience in steel girder bridge construction and one project shall demonstrate work experience in driven pile supported bridge construction and each of those projects shall have a contract value of at least $750,000.00 or more.  

Please note that FACTOR 1 (Recent Relevant Experience) differs from FACTOR 2 (Recent Relevant Past Performance).  FACTOR 1 determines whether or not an offeror has performed similar work whereas FACTOR 2 evaluates how well the offeror performed.

 2. Recent Relevant Past Performance: Offeror's past performance shall be reviewed to determine relevancy and confidence assessment.  Offerors shall provide at least one (1) recent, relevant project for a steel girder bridge (ten page limit) and at least three (3) recent relevant project for driven pile supported bridge (ten page limit). Projects shall include current points of contact and phone numbers. The contractor is solely responsible for the accuracy of this information as the Government will not pursue incorrect contact data.

For a project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the prime contractor on it. In addition to scope, each project shall have a current or final contract value greater than $750,000.00 and have been completed within the past five past five (5) years or be currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).  Furthermore, for each project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the Prime Contractor on it.  Projects do not have to have been with a Federal Agency to be considered. Offerors may submit the same projects as those proposed for FACTOR 1 (Recent Relevant Experience).

In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance.  Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE / Unique Entity Identifiers (i.e. DUNS) of team members (i.e. partnerships, joint ventures, teaming arrangements or parent companies / subsidiaries / affiliates) identified in the offeror's proposals, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.

While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the offeror.

 3. Price: The total value of all tasks combined will be assessed to determine the overall Price Fair and Reasonable.  If any of the tasks appear to be unbalanced, a review of the breakdown of each task will be conducted.  

Offeror's prices for each item within the bid schedule shall represent the best price in response to the solicitation.  Prices will be evaluated using price analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(a)(2) and 15.404-1(b).  Prices shall be evaluated to determine fairness, reasonableness and if unbalanced pricing exists.

Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated.  If price analysis techniques indicate that a proposal is unbalanced, the contracting officer shall consider the risks to the Government associated with the unbalanced pricing.  An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government (no page limit).

<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), Herndon, VA in support of Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office (PEO) for Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS), has issued Request for Proposal (RFP) 140D7019R0005 for the procurement of commercial aviation support services using Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, ¿Acquisition of Commercial Items.¿ This RFP is for the award of a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Unit-Price (FFUP) task orders. The period of performance is up to five (5) years and consists of a 12 month base period and four (4), 12 month options. This is a total small business set-aside under NAICS 481219 - Other Nonscheduled Air Transportation, which has a small business size standard of $15.0M. 

Background:
NAVSEA PEO IWS has a need for contractor-operated and contractor-maintained light and medium lift rotary wing aircraft and flight services to support the Test and Evaluation (T&E)
Program for Navy ship weapon systems. Flight services are intended to provide transportation of cargo and government and contractor personnel in support of military offshore requirements. The government may require the contractor to install or remove special-use equipment on aircraft, prepare aircraft for mobilization to a forward operating base, repair Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), or purchase additional component equipment for use in the performance of the resultant contract.

There will be one primary medium lift aircraft that shall be designated as Exclusive Use (EU) and will be utilized for 365 days within first twelve-month period of performance and potentially up to an estimated 260 flight hours in addition to the guaranteed EU availability. The contractor will also be required to provide one medium lift On-Call (OC)/Call-When-Needed (CWN) aircraft that may be utilized for up to 300 flight hours. There may be an additional requirement to provide a third OC/CWN aircraft in which a light helicopter would be requested up to 100 flight hours.

The Navy has interagency and cooperative agreements with other Federal agencies, State agencies, and private landholders, and may dispatch aircraft under the resultant contract for such cooperative use. Aircraft will support military test and trial operations including missions to/from various shore locations and U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and other seagoing vessels. Operations shall conform to procedures provided at preflight/mission briefings and will be required to comply with shipboard landing training/certifications at all times under the contracts performance.

The primary locations where services are to be performed will be in Virginia and California; however, aircraft may be required to fly to other various locations throughout the United States and its territories, as needed.

The contractor will be required to hold and keep current multiple aviation certificates required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOI OAS, Air Mobility Command (AMC), and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). In addition, the Contractor will be required to obtain and maintain SECRET security clearances for all pilots and CONFIDENTIAL security clearances for all other personnel, as specified in DD Form 254: Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification. Contractor must also obtain security clearances for all crewmembers and support personnel engaged in operations under the resulting contract.

A BOA is not a contract. Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The BOA template to be utilized is attached to this notice. See Attachment 1. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually, to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.</p>
<p>Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price/cost proposals leading to the award of orders. Future orders may be competed based on a Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) or Best Value basis. Specific firm-fixed price and cost reimbursement orders will be competed among the BOA holders. In order to receive a cost-type order, a contractor must have a Government approved accounting system prior to issuance of RFP.</p>
<p>Issuance of BOA's will be based on the government's evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA to a contractor who fails to meet the above stated criteria. BOAs will be issued for a period of five years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.

<DESC>1. Reference RFP, page 81, paragraph 4.3.1.4.2.1, Priced Bill of<br />Material (PBOM)- The priced BOM (PBOM) requirement is not possible with a<br />developmental program whereby components and suppliers are unknown until the<br />program becomes more mature. Can the government accept BOM pricing?<br />estimates based on assumptions or from similar programs?
<p>The answer is yes, BOM items may be estimates based on the Offeror' s<br />proposed approach.</p>
<p>2. Reference RFP, Page 69, VOLUME 3 - PAST PERFORMANCE- With the<br />proposal period extended to Feb 19th, can the government allow for a like<br />extended-period for all other time-sensitive requirements within the RFP,<br />especially as it relates to past performance submittals which required<br />questionnaires to be submitted "...within two weeks of the solicitations<br />release date..."?</p>
<p>For the page referenced (Page 69), the Offeror is encouraged to send PPQ's<br />to the contracts PCO/ACO/PM etc. for efforts that do not have current CPARS<br />as soon as possible. There is no need for the Government to extend this<br />period as this effort is solely within the discretion of the Offeror. The<br />Government does still request Past Performance Data to be submitted to the<br />Government two weeks before the proposal submission date per guidance within<br />in Section L part A paragraph 4.1 (Proposal Submission).</p>

NAVFAC is seeking industry feedback for P-310 Dry Dock 1 Super Flood Basin, P-1074 Extend Portal Crane in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine. The project includes: 

P-310 - Construct a new 150,000 SF superflood basin outside of existing Dry Dock #1, modifies an existing caisson to serve as the superflood basin gate, and constructs new portal crane and railroad rails along Berths 1 and 2.

P-1074 - Construct additional portal crane rails at Berths 1 and 2 to support load testing and heavy-lift capabilities along with various utility improvements to support enhanced LA class maintenance and overhaul capabilities at Dry Dock #1.

The estimated range of construction cost for this project is $100-$250 million.

At this Industry Day, specific feedback concerning phasing, scheduling, task challenges, and acquisition strategy will be requested.

This will be an excellent opportunity for contractors with NAICS code 237990 and similar construction experience to learn more about this upcoming project and the acquisition plan.

Firms interested in participating in this industry day meeting are requested to respond by emailing the Contract Specialist, Mr.
John Bishop, at john.p.bishop1@navy.mil by Friday, January 11th.
Please provide the attached Local Visitor Request Form, the name of the firm, and the names and email addresses of the individuals who will be attending.

This event is open to all contractors and is not restricted to those currently under contract with NAVFAC.

<p>Place of Performance: Hereford Inlet - Anglesea, Townsends Inlet to Cape May Inlet, North Wildwood, New Jersey in North Wildwood, Cape May County, NJ.<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, intends to award a firm fixed contract for work that consists of repairs to the Hereford Inlet Seawall of approximately 550 feet at three separate locations between Stations 3+50 and 16+00. The project area is entirely within the municipality of North Wildwood City. The contract work may also include one Option, in locations within and outside the Base Bid area. The major items of work to be performed under this contract for the Base Bid and Options includes, but is not limited to, the following (quantities shown are approximate):</p>

The conditions in and about the work site are extremely dynamic and dangerous. The tidal currents are strong and the waves are generally rough. The frequent passing of large commercial and recreational vessels create large waves that will affect construction operations.</p>
