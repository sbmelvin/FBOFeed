<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis to NTELX, Inc, under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This acquisition is in support of the Predictive Risk - Based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) system.
<p>PREDICT is an analytical tool that applies risk based targeting rules to import entry lines for which FDA must make admissibility decisions each year on regulated products. The risk scoring supports FDA's mission by helping to identify regulated products that may be more volatile, thus improving FDA's ability to protect health.

<a href="mailto:Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov">Julie A. Janus</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NNG09EK06C with the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) for the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission.	UCLA is currently performing both the instrument operations management, which includes instrument operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations which includes planning all instrument modes, table loads, calibrations and data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS). <p> NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to UCLA.  The estimated period of performance of this cost-no-fee (CNF) contract extension will be for 2-years from March 16, 2015 through March 15, 2017. <p> The UCLA, in conjunction with their partner at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons:  1) This procurement will enable the science and flight operations activities to be merged and carried out at UCLA with a substantial university undergraduate and graduate student educational involvement.  Only UCLA possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed knowledge of the DLRE instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to carry out the targeting and operations in a manner in which the scientific operations and the flight operations can be merged;  2) Current DLRE team members are unique in their familiarity with the DLRE instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft.  From 2005-2009, UCLA and JPL designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the DLRE instrument with the LRO spacecraft, including testing at the Spacecraft level after spacecraft integration. Under contract NNG09EK06C, UCLA has successfully carried out the science operations and science analysis of the DLRE instrument on the LRO spacecraft since the LRO launch in June 2009.  Dr. David Paige, of UCLA, is a leading expert in his field of planetary geophysics and was selected by NASA Headquarters to lead this investigation, based on an evaluation of his proposal submitted under the Announcement of Opportunity for exploration measurements in NASAs LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O).  The DLRE instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument.  In addition, UCLA led the development of unique software and processes for:  testing the instruments on-orbit, creating the operational table loads, processing the raw data so that scientists can manipulate, display, and analyze the scientific data received, and producing summary data.	This effort requires the detailed understanding of the instrument and all related software; 3) UCLA scientists have led the effort, in the community, to analyze the images and data products from the DLRE Instrument, and are currently the only organization with the capability to carry out the combined scientific and instrument operations in conjunction with the educational opportunities.  This effort requires the detailed understanding of the instrument and all related software.  Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement. <p> Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 8, 2015.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. <p>

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE) in Jacksonville, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm fixed-price design -build construction contract for the construction of Water Distribution System Repairs, NAS JRB New Orleans, LA.  This design-build solicitation notice is being advertised on an unrestricted basis, inviting full and open competition by all interested firms with specialized experience and qualifications required by this project. 

A solicitation was posted on NECO on 17 October 2014, restricted to a Small Business Multiple Award Construction Contract.  During the solicitation phase, only one of the seven contractors stated they could meet the requirements of the RFP.
  The solicitation was cancelled and will be reissued with full and open competition.  The NAVFACSE small business office concurs with the decision to invite full and open competition.

This project is for the repair of a Water Distribution System at NAS JRB New Orleans, LA.  This project involves all analysis, field investigation, solution development, computer modeling, permitting, design, construction and testing of the water system repairs so that the domestic potable water system will meet all water quality requirements of local, state, and Federal authorities while completely splitting the potable domestic water system from the non-potable flight line fire protection system so that the fire main system provides sufficient water to the hangars without affecting domestic water quality.
 Final testing and commissioning of the water system will require the Contractor to prove that the performance criteria have been met in this Design-Build construction project.

This is a negotiated procurement utilizing a best value source selection process. Award will be made to the offeror whose total price and non cost/price proposal offers the best value to the government.  Proposals will be evaluated on total price for the project.

Contract award is anticipated on or around 29 May 2015.  The construction completion date will be 572 calendar days from the date of the contract award. The estimated price range for the entire project is between $15,000,000.00 and $20,000,000.00.  The NAICS Code is 237110 with a small business size standard of $36,500,000.
 This will be an electronic solicitation, which can be downloaded from Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov.  The solicitation will be available at this site no earlier than 15 days after this pre-solicitation notice is posted.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit will be held.  Details on the site visit will be provided in the solicitation.  Proposals will be due no earlier than 30 days after the solicitation is released (exact date and time will be specified in the solicitation).  Offerors are responsible to check FedBizOpps for the solicitation and any subsequent amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO   8), Orlando (Central) Florida intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the NCO 8 area which includes the following SIX counties: Orange County, Lake County, Seminole County, Osceola County, and Brevard County and Volusia County to provide community nursing home services at contractor's facilities under Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).  

The VA anticipates issuing an open and continuous solicitation for this requirement on or about 12/24/2014. Proposals will be accepted for a one-year period commencing with the issuance date of the solicitation. Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide instructions to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective Offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.  

In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management, prospective contractors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and in VetBiz databases under the applicable NAICS.  Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov and Vet Biz information at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov. To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management database.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the SAM website as no BOAs can be awarded to any offeror not registered in SAM.

NAICS Code is 623110 (Nursing Care Facilities) with a Small Business Size Standard of $25.5M.  The classification code is Q402.  The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition.  Multiple awards are anticipated and will be made on an as needed basis.  All responsible sources may submit proposals to be considered by the Agency. 

The VA will only consider proposals from contractors who are licensed by their respective States and who are Medicare/Medicaid qualified.

Placements will be made in contract nursing home facilities based on availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.  

Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  Telephone requests for information or questions will NOT be accepted.  Please email requests or questions to Marie Smith, at the following e-mail address:  marie.smith4@va.gov and ensure that the subject line includes:  solicitation no.

<DESC>Pre Solicitation Notice for W912GB-15-R-0004  <br>  <br> Project Title and Location: Integrated Training Area Management GIS Services Contract for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015  <br>  <br> The United States (U.S.) Government is soliciting interest for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multi Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide training land management capability across the total Army.  The US Army recognizes that the execution of training to doctrinal standards under realistic combat conditions will affect the environment.  The ITAM Program is also an essential part of the Army's commitment to environmental stewardship.  ITAM establishes a systematic framework for decision-making and management of Army training lands.  This allows the Army to manage its land in an environmentally sound manner to ensure no net loss of training lands for accomplishing primary activities (training, testing, storage, etc,) or for impacting the overall training capability.  The effective integration of stewardship principles into training land and conservation management practices ensures that the Army's lands remain viable to support future training and mission requirements indefinitely.  It integrates elements of operational, environmental, master planning, and other programs to identify and assess land use alternatives.  The ITAM Program thus supports sound natural and cultural resource management practices to provide stewardship of land assets, while sustaining those assets to support training, testing, and other installation missions.  The ITAM program consists of four major elements:  (i) Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA, (ii) Training Requirements Integration (TRI), (iii) Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM), (iv) Sustainable Range Awareness (SRA).   <br> The Contractor shall support the aforementioned programs (depending upon the particular scope of the work contained in an individual Task Order) by conducting appropriate field surveys, field sampling, investigations, site visits, interviews, and literature searches; execute suitable studies; prepare satisfactory reports, prepare plans and specifications, perform on-going site monitoring, Geographic Information System support, imagery/drawings, cartographic mapping, and provide on-site support to assist in performing Sustainable Range Program (SRP) related tasks.  Any or all of the above may be required during the period of this contract.  Those work efforts described above may occur at any location described below. <br> There will be one (1) solicitation for the following geographical locations:  Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Slovenia.  Majority of the work is anticipated to be primarily in Germany. <br> Each project task order awarded under this contract shall normally be comprised of a number of pre-described and pre-packed tasks as described in each Task Order and the Unit Price Book. <br> The Award of this contract will be made on best value to the Government. Price and Technical factors will be considered. <br>  <br> a. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  <br> A base period of one (1) year and (3) three-year option periods. <br>  <br> b. MAXIMUM CONTRACT VALUE:  <br> It is anticipated $2,375,000.00 annually for the base period and 3 option years, not-to-exceed $9,500,000 for the entire life of the contract. <br>  <br> c. MINIMUM GUARANTEE:  <br> A single minimum guarantee amount of $5,000 covers the base period and any option period(s).  <br>  <br> d. TASK ORDER LIMITATIONS:  <br> The minimum task order is $2,500 and the maximum task order is $1,250,000 (reference clause 52.216-19).  On a case by case basis the Contracting Officer has the authority to issue task orders that may exceed the maximum task order limit. <br>  <br> A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to encourage early Contractor involvement. Potential offerors are encouraged to submit questions related to this notice or the draft SOW no later than Tuesday 05 January 2014 to Contract Specialist Ian McClary at Ian.R.McClary@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer Frank Johnson at Frank.j.Johnson@usace.army.mil.  You will be informed when and where you may obtain a copy of the solicitation documents as well as details on any potential site visit. Solicitation will be issued on or about Thursday 26 January 2015. <br>  <br> Solicitation cancellation with no obligation to the Government-  quote mark Note to offerors: The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation, either before or after the proposal opening with no obligation to the offeror by the Government. quote mark  <br>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only released pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201(e). This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The United States Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Short Range Recovery (SRR) division is conducting Market Research to seek Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved contractors with the facilities, skills, knowledge, and resources required to complete this effort. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned. <br /><br />The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates a fleet of one hundred and one (101) H-65 aircraft. In 2004, a major acquisition to modernize the USCG's H-65 helicopter was initiated as part of the Deepwater Project. This project was later subdivided into six (6) discrete segments to increase capability and extend the life expectancy of the H-65 aircraft. Discrete Segment 1 focused on replacing the H-65's engines with the Turbomeca Arriel 2C2CG engines and associated dynamic components. The USCG requires continued Support by the Hour (SBH) to provide comprehensive sustainment for the engines. <br /><br />The USCG is seeking a Contractor to provide all support required for the USCG to operate Arriel 2C2CG engines on a per hour basis. That support shall include repair, overhaul, labor (except for labor required for field level maintenance that will be performed by the USCG), parts, modules, special tools, test equipment and facilities necessary to perform the SBH services.<br /><br />All Contractors, qualified to provide the requisite services and material should submit a concise response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that (1) they possess the necessary knowledge, skills and experience and resources to provide the SBH services for the Arriel 2C2CG engines; (2) they possess the necessary software, technical data, facilities, and resources and demonstrated experience to provide equipment testing, repair, modification, overhaul and product improvement of the Arriel 2C2CG engines and; (3) they have the capability of providing new OEM repair parts and supply support material.<br /><br />A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this requirement is available for qualified suppliers to provide suggestions to improve the documentation that may be included in the future acquisition of Arriel 2C2CG engine SBH services. To obtain copies, Contractors should submit a written request to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil.<br /><br />After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement or special notice will be published on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website. Responses to this RFI synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. Responses to this RFI are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.<br /><br />At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the USCG may use all or part of any suggestions or questions received in future correspondence regarding the Engine SBH acquisition. The original author will not be identified. <br /><br />The USCG may consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of acquisition documents and planning for the Engine SBH acquisition. However, the USCG is not required to change or add any requirements to any future engine SBH procurements based on the responses received as a result of this RFI.<br /><br />Closing date and time for receipt of response is 12 January 2015, 4:30 p.m., EST. However, responses received after this closing date and time may still be reviewed by the USCG and used to develop the acquisition strategy. Responses must be received via email at Crystal.G.Taber@uscgmil with the following subject line "Engine SBH Comments, Company Name".<br /><br /><strong>Engine SBH Supplier Requested Information<br /></strong><br />1) For any Contractor, other than the Arriel 2C2CG Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), describe the supplier depot repair/overhaul capability.

Labor prices? If multiple indices apply, please provide the weighting you typically utilize<br />&bull; Do you participate in long-term contracts with your commercial suppliers or commercial/military customers? If so, what is your typical or industry standard for contract length to include the identification of base and option years?<br /><br />3) Do you have any comments or suggestions on the adequacy of the draft PWS to include any recommended changes/deletions/additions?<br /><br />4) Do you have any suggestions on how to revise or restructure the requirement to reduce costs?<br /><br />5) Are there any areas of the draft PWS that are unclear or ambiguous?<br /><br />6) If this were a Request for Proposal, would you take exception to any areas of the draft PWS?<br /><br />7) Provide any additional comments/information you may have regarding this procurement.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

</a>
<DESC>As part of GSAs continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings:
Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing:
To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  


Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take 9 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Effective April 1, 2010, the Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (IWAC), Schedule 71IIK will only accept proposals or contract modification requests submitted electronically through the eOffer/eMod system.  The eOffer/eMod is a web based application that allows contractors to electronically prepare and submit proposals and modification requests.  Offerors must obtain a valid digital certificate in order to use the eOffer/eMod system.  

The following link provides guidance on utilizing the eOffer and eMod systems, obtaining digital certificates, and using the eOffer and eMod Training Guides:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

Hard copy offers will not be accepted and WILL BE REJECTED.

This is a standing solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 71IIK - Comprehensive Furniture Management Schedule (CFMS) The schedule is entitled FSC  71, Part II, Section K Comprehensive Furniture Management Schedule.  This solicitation will be available electronically only and includes all current applicable clauses.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov .  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.  Search using Solicitation Number 3FNC-B3-003001-B.

The solicitation includes updated clauses and Ancillary Repair and Alterations SIN 712-97. 

Resulting contracts will be effective for five (5) year period, with three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty (20) years if performance is satisfactory.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

This is necessary in order to log in to the IPP and view or download payment information. New vendors may register on-line at https://ipp.gov. For additional information, refer to the IPP Customer Support at (866) 973-3131.</p>
<p>The IPP will continue to support the following notification services previously offered by PAID: Web access only to remittance data, no payment notification emails sent, payment notification without remittance detail, and payment notification with remittance detail. Users may select event-driven notifications and schedule the frequency. Vendors can only access their own payment data. IPP remittance information includes the following data: ACH trace number, supplier name, agency name, payment status, issue date, invoice number, PO number, invoice amount, discount amount, payment amount, bank name, and bank address. The IPP will collect payment data for 18 months, which will be available for search, display and download.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130); and</p>
<p>(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p><br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. <br />Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.

<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>C. All material and work paid for by progress payments shall thereby become the sole property of the Government, but this provision shall not relieve the Contractor from the obligation to complete the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>D. The contractor shall be paid the remaining amount due upon completion and acceptance of all work under this contract.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Price<br />2. Past Performance<br />3. Technical Evaluation</p>
<p>Past Performance and Technical is weighted approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting contract. The quality in past performance offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.</p>
<p>Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated past performance proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1, Price: The total evaluated price of the offeror will be determined by totaling the proposed prices of all the CLINs. An assessment of the reasonableness of proposed prices shall be made. Techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1(b) and as supplemented will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness.</p>
<p>Factor 2, Past Performance: This factor evaluates recent past performance on relevant work similar to the scope of work in this solicitation. Recent past performance is <br />considered to be within the last three (3) years. In evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the information in the Offeror's proposal as well as information gathered from other sources including former customers, Government agencies, federal databases and other references.</p>
<p>The Government will determine relevance of past performance information (PPI) for each offeror.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will be assigned a neutral rating.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3, TECHNICAL EVALUATION:</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Management Office for Training Systems (PM TRASYS) Training Atmospherics Set Design Enhancements/Upgrades effort. A Draft Request for Proposal (Draft RFP), including a Total Small Business Set-Aside, has been attached to this Notice. The purpose of this Notice is to seek potential Offerors and solicit information to fulfill a requirement to provide Atmospheric set dressings for Marine Corps Training Areas. These set dressing will enhance and upgrade existing and future USMC Military Operation in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Home Station Training (HST) areas and Ranges. Currently, the existing MOUT and planned HST area facilities and surrounding Range areas are void of cultural realism. Even though these areas are equipped with streets, courtyard walls, buildings, and village shanties, the atmosphere is void of detailed cultural realism such as "prop" like items (furniture, billboards, faux foodstuffs, ersatz crops, colors and mud brick facades etc.) utilized during training scenarios. Generally, MOUT and HST buildings and walls have similar facades and lack the real world exteriors, interiors, and surrounding areas representative of realistic foreign urban areas needed for vital and realistic mission rehearsals. This project is designed to simulate a future or current deployable urban environment and support the war fighting skills and improve training opportunities for Marines, tenants, and joint service units aboard USMC training areas.
<p>The Draft RFP identifies the effort(s) required for designing, installing, managing, and documenting the Atmospherics Set. This RFP delineates efforts broken down into key conceptual areas:<br />a. Set Drawings: This allows for the set drawings of a complete MOUT, HST, or Training Range or parts thereof to enhance a realistic training environment.<br />b. Delivery/Placement: This allows for delivery and placement of complete sets within the training environment to support the training requirements.<br />c.
