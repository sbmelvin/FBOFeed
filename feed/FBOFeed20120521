Each volume shall contain a glossary of any abbreviations and acronyms used with an explanation of each. Glossaries, tables of contents, and cover pages do not count against page limitations for respective volumes. To the greatest extent possible, each volume shall be written on a stand-alone basis so that its contents may be evaluated with minimal cross-referencing to other volumes of the proposal. Information needed for proposal evaluation not found in its designated volume will be assumed to have been omitted from the proposal. Cross-referencing within a proposal volume is permitted where it would conserve space without impairing clarity. 
Failure to provide all requested information may render a proposal unacceptable.
The government will not evaluate pages that exceed the stated page limit. If an offeror's proposal exceeds the page limits below, the government will not review or consider information contained in the excess pages. 
b.	Contents of Proposals The contractor shall submit a written proposal in two Parts. Part I is the Technical Capability section and Part II is the Price section.  Part I: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FACTOR 1: Section A, Past Performance is limited to 5 pages.
FACTOR 2: Section A, Technical Approach is limited to 3 pages. Section B, Key Personnel Resume(s) are limited to 2 pages for each person. Section C, Experience/Industry Knowledge - Experience is limited to 3 pages. 
Part II: PRICE Section A, Proposal Cover Letter is limited to 1 electronic page Section B, Representation and Certifications 52.212-3 completed Section C, Price: CLIN schedule completed 
Part 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY Factor 1: Section A, Past Performance: The Past Performance narrative shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary to fully explain the quoted past performance. The Government wants assurance past performance demonstrates the selected contractor exemplifies the capability of project execution and completion as described in this SOW. Examples must be recent, having been performed in the last five (5) years. The offeror must describe how its past performance is on a scale similar in size to this requirement. The strength of the offeror's response will be based on the implementation of psychological services and benefits/achievement(s) of students who have received psychological services. Provide reference and phone numbers of CORs/points-of-contact from past contracts.
Factor 2: Section A: Technical Approach. The Government has intentionally described its requirement through the Statement of Work to solicit the expertise of industry to construct an offer it believes will best achieve the performance.  
(1) The Technical Approach shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary, but limited to page constraints to fully explain the quoted technical approach. 
(2) The technical quote should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work to be performed and include measurable performance standards by which performance will be evaluated for determining whether the offeror performed successfully. 
(3) The quote shall include the offeror's understanding of the Bureau of Indian Education's, goals for the project and an understanding of the SOW. 
(4) The technical approach should include, but is not be limited to the following:
(a) A description of the processes the offeror routinely uses to provide psychological services. (b) A description of conditions which can affect achieving the stated performance 	objectives.
Factor 2: Section B: Key Personnel: The contractor shall demonstrate knowledge and experience by submitting resume(s) for key personnel.

Factor 2: Section C: Experience/Industry Knowledge: The offeror shall describe the relevance of the past performance to be provided under Section A: Past Performance. Specifically, the contractor shall demonstrate its knowledge of psychological services.  The offeror must demonstrate their experience and knowledge to positive improvement and/or successful results of students who have received psychological services, without revealing the personal identity of students.  
Part II: PRICE The Government will evaluate each offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness. The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. 
Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. 
The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 
The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.
Price quotes shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1. Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc); 2. Indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  3.Inclusive of any Federal, State, and Local taxes, in accordance with FAR 52.229-04 and FAR 52.229-10.  
The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the realism of the offeror's price and to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.
The Government, at a minimum, expects a payment schedule that is on a firm fixed price to include hourly rates, daily rates, preparation rates with number of days, taxes, and travel. 
Offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor, if applicable. The Department of Labor, Wage Determination No. 2005-2362, Revision No. 12, Date of 6/13/2011 is applicable in the State of New Mexico. Other applicable Wage Determination rates may be provided by the Contracting Officer if a written request is submitted to the Contracting Officer 10 days prior to the closing of the RFP. The offeror has public access at http://www.wdol.gov/ to locate the prevailing wage rates for their area.  
4. Proposal Acceptance Period Notwithstanding FAR clause 52.212-1, the proposal acceptance period is 90 days after the date set for receipt of proposals. The Offeror shall make a clear statement in the proposal cover page that the proposal is valid until this period has ended.
5. Proposal Preparation Costs 
The Government will not be obligated to pay any costs incurred by an offeror in the preparation and submission of a proposal in response to this RFP.

4. The evaluation of factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. 
5. Evaluation Scoring: The Government will evaluate all offerors according to the evaluation criteria. Each Non-Price Factor will be rated with a color-point system. 
Blue (50 pts) - Outstanding - The response is very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear. Proposal consistently meets the solicitation requirements with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.
Green (30pts) - Excellent - Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.
Orange (15 pts) - Satisfactory - The response generally meets requirements but there is no expectation of better than acceptable performance.  Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without minor revision to the proposal.
Yellow ( 5 pts) - Poor - The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revision to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.
Red (0 pts)  - Unsatisfactory - Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection Procurement Process, Subpart 3.2.2.4.1.2, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to contract with a selected firm using single source procedures.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a contract to JVN Communications, Inc., Absecon, New Jersey  to provide the Air Traffic Organization - Terminal Field Operational Support (ATO-TFOS) with FAA Inter-facility Radar Simulator (FIRS) Platform upgrades to existing Stand-alone Inter-facility Radar Simulator (SIRS) and Rack-mount Inter-facility Radar Simulators (RIFRS) used in Standard Terminal Automation Radar System (STARS) and Common Automated Radar Terminal System (CARTS) air traffic control test laboratories.  These upgrades include servers and/or standalone processors, user licenses and training of Simulation Driver Radar Recorder (SDRR) Graphical Scenario Generation Tool (GSGT), Random Access Plan Position Indicators (RAPPI) Airspace Visual Display (AVID), Inter-facility Shadow (IFShadow) and JVN Flight Data Input/Output (JFDIO) platforms.  
JVN Communications Inc. owns intellectual property rights to all FIRS applications and device drivers.  FIRS was developed by JVN Communications, Inc. to perform and support Automation Radar Tracking Systems (ARTS). FIRS is also used at test systems located within the William J. Hughes Technical Center and Operational Support Facilities (OSF) within the FAA National Airspace System (NAS).  FIRS provides a Graphical User Interface-based presentation that accelerated the development and accuracy of test scenarios by providing a visual presentation that can be validated against test expectations during scenario development.  It accepts inputs scenarios from STARS ATCoach and CARTS Enhanced Target Generator and exports them to Simulation Driver Radar Recorder input files that can be used to test the system in near-real-time environments.  These FIRS characteristics allow the OSF's to produce and deliver error free air traffic control software. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above required work, and the FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Jason Kuo, not later than 1:00 p.m. local time, May 24, 2012.  Responses shall be sent via e-mail to jason.kuo@faa.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under FAR Part 13 simplified acquisition procedures with the Russian Federation. Rosatome (Russia?s State Nuclear Energy Commission) is the owner of the BOR60 facility.  Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) is the State?s nuclear energy operator of the BOR60 facility.   The scope of work for phase 1 will include the development of a feasibility study by RIAR for US selected material test options for a BOR60 reactor irradiation.
Based on the test options proposed by the U.S., the Russian Federation will identify candidate design options with cost estimates for the fabrication of a US materials test capsule and for BOR60 irradiation charges. The cost estimates will also include receiving the U.S. samples, loading the test capsules into the reactor, unloading the test capsules after completion of the irradiation and loading the samples into a shipping cask for shipment back to the U.S.  
The Russian Federation, Rosatom ? RIAR is the only source that can perform this work because they are the owner/operator of the BOR60 fast reactor.  Currently, Russia is the only foreign country with an operational fast reactor (BOR60) that is available to the US for near-term material irradiations.  
The period of performance is for four months from date of award.  A study with cost estimates will be delivered to DOE.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS (DAIDS), has a requirement for the provision of support services for the NIAID/DAIDS clinical research portfolio.
<p><br />The development of HIV vaccines and other prevention strategies relies on the use of nonhuman primates in preclinical studies to advance the development of effective AIDS vaccine candidates and to advance development of effective topical microbicides and other prevention modalities or immune-based therapies. The NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contracts shall provide nonhuman primate resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines. The SVEUs conduct studies in support of vaccines being developed by a wide range of investigators. These studies complement NIAID-supported basic vaccine research and vaccine evaluation studies funded through R01 (investigator-initiated research) grants, HIVRAD (HIV Vaccine Research and Design Program) grants, IPCAVD (Integrated Preclinical-Clinical AIDS Vaccine Development) grants, and NHP Consortium awards. The SVEUs also perform studies of candidate vaccines offered by companies or other researchers.</p>
<p>The SVEUs will use state-of-the-art techniques and technologies in evaluating promising AIDS prevention strategies in nonhuman primate models and will incorporate new and improved techniques and technologies into the studies conducted throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>This is a recompetition of existing contracts entitled "Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs)" (contract number HHSN266200600005C with Advanced BioScience Laboratory, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, contract number HHSN266200600006C with the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, and contract number HHSN266200600007C with BioQual, Inc., Rockville, Maryland.</p>

<CONTACT>David Stemple, Phone 269-961-5372, Email david.stemple@dla.mil
<DESC>This announcement is issued as a special notice to award a brand name order to Redwood Software, Inc. 3000 Aerial Center Pkwy., Ste. 115, Morrisville, NC 27560-7677. The Defense Logistics Agency requires annual maintenance renewals for Report2Web (R2W) software applications.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Redwood R2W v2.5 Single-Processor VAR development license, POP: 6/1/2012 through 5/31/13, QTY: 01 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: Redwood R2W v2.5 SQL Server Edition Dual-Processor license, POP: 6/1/2012 through 5/31/13, QTY: 03 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 0003: Redwood Report Burster Dual-Processor license, POP: 6/1/2012 through 5/31/13, QTY: 03 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 0004: Redwood Report Router Dual-Processor license, POP: 6/1/2012 through 5/31/13, QTY: 01 EA.</p>
<p>Redacted Justification: The Defense Logistics Agency has determined the renewal of maintenance on existing R2W software is necessary because of the critical roles the software fills. The renewal of maintenance allows the Government to keep software patches current and vendor support, in the event of an outage or due to security vulnerability. Any interruption in the maintenance support would be critical to completion of vital cataloging and provisioning production workload and ultimately inhibit the Defense Logistics Agencies ability to support the Warfighter. Per Redwood Software, Inc., only Redwood can maintain this proprietary software. There are no vendors or partners authorized to maintain the software. Maintenance on existing software is significantly more cost effective than procuring alternative software to fill this critical role.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Award will be made to Redwood Software, Inc. as they are the original manufacturer of the hardware and/or software and are the only known source that can provide the required support. If there are any other firms who can satisfy this requirement, please submit a proposal by 4:00 PM. EST on Friday, May 25, 2012.</p>
<p>The primary point of contact for this announcement is David Stemple. Defense Logistics Agency, DLA Contracting Service Office, HDI Federal Center, Attn: David Stemple DCSO-B, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3092, (269) 961-5372, david.stemple@dla.mil.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NIH's mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The goals of the agency are as follows: 1) foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis to advance significantly the Nation's capacity to protect and improve health; 2) develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and physical resources that will assure the Nation's capability to prevent disease; 3) expand the knowledge base in medical and associated sciences in order to enhance the Nation's economic well-being and ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research; and 4) exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science. NIH's organization currently consists of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) principally located in the Bethesda, Maryland area.</p>
<p>Further information about NIH is provided at http://www.nih.gov.</p>
<p>The CIT Training Program offers a wide variety of courses and seminars. The program's mission is to enable users to make efficient and effective use of computers, networks, and information systems in their work at NIH. Its mission is to help staff perform their current work assignments. CIT offers a program with a broad selection of IT-related topics based on the needs of its NIH customers. Course and seminar subjects include but are not limited to scientific, administrative, programming, networks, grants and other enterprise systems, web development, security, commercial off the shelf (COTS) software, and statistics. The program (1) ensures that class content is NIH-specific and reflects systems, science and other technology in use at the NIH; (2) provides classes that are cutting edge; (3) continually looks towards future needs and products; and (4) responds quickly to demands for new classes and programs.</p>
<p>The CIT Training Program currently provides over 120 technical courses to more than 8,000 NIH customers (NIH Federal staff and contractors) per year utilizing classroom space in (1) Building 12A at the main NIH Campus at 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland; and (2) 10401 Fernwood Road (i.e., the Fernwood Building).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />SAFETY AND REGULATORY ISSUES OF THE THORIUM FUEL CYCLE
<p><br />THE U. S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (NRC) is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis as a means of conducting market research or as a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of the business community to provide all management, supervision, administration, and labor for assistance of NRC with project work involving the investigation of the safety and regulatory issues of the thorium fuel cycle, and which is described below. Services are to be provided to the NRC in Rockville, MD. The acquisition will be for one period of 12 months. It is estimated that approximately 1140 staff hours will be needed to provide the requested supplies and/or services. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is (541330). The Draft Statement of Work is attached.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposal; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders. <br /><br />Although almost all of the world's reactors utilize uranium as their fuel, the nuclear energy community continues to maintain an interest in the utilization of thorium fuel both in current core designs, including pressurized water reactors (PWR) and boiling water reactors (BWR), and in next generation reactors. There are advantages in using nuclear fuel that can potentially reduce uranium utilization with higher conversion ratios, is far more abundant than the only other actinide found in nature, uranium, and appears to have several desirable safety features such higher melting temperatures and reduced radioactivity for long term spent fuel storage. There is a sizeable operating experience from which to obtain valuable data for further improved designs: over the past decades, various designs of experimental and commercial thorium reactors were built and operated in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>In the U.S., several demonstrations of the use of thorium in nuclear reactors have been performed. These include irradiations in light water reactors including Elk River (BWR), Indian Point (PWR), and Shippingport (PWR). The Shippingport experience also demonstrated the breeding potential of using thorium in a light water reactor. The use of thorium was also widespread in high temperature gas-cooled reactors including Peach Bottom 1 and Fort St. Vrain. The regulations under which the thorium fuel operating licenses were granted to US plants four and five decades ago have significantly evolved and a scoping study of the safety issues and the licensing requirements of a thorium fuel cycle under the current regulatory environment will undoubtedly yield numerous areas where serious updates will be needed.</p>
<p>The specific areas that need additional attention include a review of impacts of the introduction of thorium ranging from the front to back end of the fuel cycle including impacts on reactor operation and safety. This would include a review of the NRC analysis tools to identify development needs, the collection of available validation data and identification of validation data gaps, and an assessment of regulatory issues. Additionally, domestic and international activities should be reviewed and areas of collaboration considered.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY SOUGHT <br /><br />The NRC is seeking to identify organizations capable of providing technical assistance in evaluating the safety issues and the regulatory requirements specific to a thorium-based fuel cycle for current and advanced reactor designs and identify gaps and recommended future research and development to support thorium license requests.</p>
<p>The selected organization must have extensive research experience with demonstrated knowledge of historical and current thorium-based fuel cycles, fuel designs, and demonstrated expertise in the neutronics, mechanical, and safety aspect of these cycles. Based on knowledge of the current safety basis for LWRs, the organization is expected to perform an assessment of the impacts of thorium on reactor operations and safety to identify key phenomena that require alternative assessments or consideration</p>
<p>The organization would need to provide a very broad technical expertise, including intricate familiarization with all technical, safety, and regulatory aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle associated with fabrication, irradiation in the reactor core, and waste management. The organization must have comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the current NRC regulation and associated design, testing, maintenance, surveillance, and mitigation criteria. With its combined advanced knowledge and experience with both the uranium and the thorium fuel cycles, the selected organization will provide recommendations for improvements needed in reactor analysis capabilities, potential impacts on safety requirements, and identification of knowledge gaps that require additional analysis or research to address. The organization will capture the evaluation results and recommendations in a draft NUREG/CR report for review by NRC staff and will provide a final report including staff comments.</p>
<p>MANDATORY QUALIFYING CRITERIA:</p>
<p>The investigators must have advanced levels of engineering education and experience commensurate with the complexity of this research, and exhaustive working knowledge of current and advanced thorium fuel cycle research. Specifically, the investigators must have demonstrated expertise in the following:</p>
<p>- Thorium fuel cycles including U.S. and international experience<br />- Current activities and research and development on thorium fuel cycles<br />- Physics of reactors utilizing thorium including U-233 fueled reactors<br />- Thorium fuel design, properties, and irradiation performance<br />- Design, operation, and safety of light water reactors (LWR) and advanced reactor concepts (including high temperature gas-cooled reactors and molten salt reactor) <br />- NRC safety regulations for LWR and regulatory experience associated with advanced reactors and fuels<br />- Reactor physics and fuel cycle analysis <br />- Fuel fabrication, transportation and storage (including criticality safety)<br />- Issues associated with use of greater than 5 wt.% enriched uranium to support thorium fuels<br />- Spent fuel characterization, storage, and disposal</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response. The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed below. The package should also include past performance/experience regarding projects of similar scope listing the project title, general description, the dollar value of the contract, and name of the company, agency, or government entity for which the work was performed. <br /><br />Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested.

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought<br />This Sources Sought Notice is for market research and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.<br /><br />This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small business offerors that can provide continuing monitoring and evaluation services (both technical and advisory). Additionally the contractor will assist with the development of objective, program, and activity levels in accordance with USAID's January 2011Evaluation Policy. Requirements are as follows:<br /><br />1. Design and implement both evaluation studies (quantitative and qualitative) and also assessments of USAID/Peru programs.<br />2. Provide performance monitoring and evaluation technical assistance and training for USAID/Peru, its implementing partners and host country government counterparts.<br />3. Strengthen the capacity of local evaluation institutions to design and implement evaluation studies and assessments according to international standards. <br /><br />Background: <br />USAID Forward is an ambitious reform effort which hopes to change the way USAID does business-with new partnerships, an emphasis on innovation and a relentless focus on results. This includes a renewed effort to strengthen the use of monitoring and evaluation, to build local capacity to improve aid effectiveness, and to strengthen collaboration and partnership with bilateral donors, multilateral and international organizations which will hopefully increase synergies and avoid duplication. <br /><br />Towards this goal, in January of 2011, USAID released a new evaluation policy aimed at improving accountability, learning, and evidence-based decision making. This new policy will require increased rigor, objectivity, and transparency in all of USAID's evaluations. Notable new requirements include:<br /><br />&#9679; Identifying key evaluation questions during the project design phase<br />&#9679; Collecting high-quality baseline data for variables that correspond to key project outcomes and impacts <br />&#9679; In cases where impact evaluations are undertaken, establishing a parallel evaluation mechanism at project inception to accompany implementation<br />&#9679; Conducting at least one performance evaluation of each large project (defined as equal or exceeding in dollar value the mean (average) project size for the mission)<br />&#9679; Conducting an impact evaluation of any activity within a project involving untested hypotheses or designed as a "pilot" or "proof of concept"<br />As a result, USAID/Peru will make every effort to not only strengthen its monitoring and evaluation oversight, but to also ensure that the local capacity is built to carry on these functions and make them sustainable. <br /><br />USAID/Peru is increasing its partnerships with local partners and host country governments with limited monitoring and evaluation expertise at the regional level. USAID/Peru's new country strategy will need to align its monitoring and evaluation activities with the new Agency's goal of building local capacity, managing for results, improving accountability, and learning efforts. <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide services in these three major components: <br /><br />Component 1: Evaluation Studies and Assessments<br /><br />Overview<br />The purpose of this component, in accordance with the USAID Evaluation Policy, is to perform high quality evaluation studies of the Peru bilateral and South America Regional portfolios. Studies include evaluations that assess the impact of USAID's development objectives that identify lessons learned concerning which development interventions work and which do not, and that focus on issues that cut across USAID's technical areas. <br /><br />Towards this end, the Contractor is required throughout the performance period of this contract to provide services for implementing quantitative and qualitative baseline studies, evaluation case studies, performance evaluations, impact (experimental and quasi-experimental) evaluations, cross-sector and multi-country evaluations, survey research and statistical analysis and other evaluative studies. <br /><br />General approach<br />The Contractor will implement activities under this component taking into account USAID principles and requirements, including those within USAID's Evaluation policy and ADS 203. http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/203.pdf<br />Prior to carrying out each scheduled evaluation, the USAID/Peru Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in cooperation with other USAID/Peru staff will prepare a detailed statement of work (SOW) in close coordination with the Contractor. The Contractor will use its expertise to propose the evaluation design that best meets USAID Evaluation Policy standards and principles, USAID/Peru needs, resources, and complexity of the program. In addition to designing and conducting the evaluation, the SOW could include, among others, the following tasks: <br /><br />Activities <br />USAID/Peru has identified a list of 23 evaluation studies,that the Contractor will carry out under this component. This list includes evaluations of projects, programs and development objectives that have been awarded and projects that are in currently in the pre-award phase. <br />Impact evaluations <br /><br />The contractor is required to conduct the following impact evaluations of USAID assistance under each Development Objective (DO). Impact evaluations will construct a counterfactual case of what would have occurred in the absence of USAID intervention. Tasks for impact evaluations will include but are not limited to the design of the evaluation approach, including the design of the counterfactual, collection of baseline data, reconstruction of baseline information (in the event a baseline was not collected for an activity), mid-term and final data collection, analysis and dissemination of results. All evaluation designs must be approved by the USAID/Peru COR. The USAID/Peru COR will share evaluation designs with country-level stakeholders and implementing partners before approval.<br /><br />Performance evaluations<br />The Contractor will be required to conduct mid-term and final performance evaluations of USAID projects. Tasks for performance evaluations may include but are not limited to the design of the evaluation approach, baseline reconstruction, data collection, analysis and dissemination of results. All evaluation designs must be approved by the USAID/Peru COR. The USAID/Peru COR will share evaluation designs with country-level stakeholders and implementing partners before approval. <br /><br />Sector and cross-cutting assessments<br />The Contractor will be required to conduct the following sector and cross-cutting assessments to identify lessons learned and opportunities for enhancing sector performance. Assessments shall entail a status update on a particular sector or sub-sector and its weaknesses, strengths, gaps, and opportunities for value-added intervention by USAID/Peru based on its comparative advantage.<br />Activities:<br /><br />Facilitate the preparation of USAID/Peru Performance Management Plans.<br />Monitoring and evaluation training and technical assistance for partners.
<p>Support to USAID/PERU Evaluation Team.<br /><br />Component 2: Strengthening local capacity for evaluation <br />Overview<br />The purpose of this component is to strengthen the technical capacities of at least two local institutions to design and conduct effective performance and impact development evaluations.<br /><br />The Contractor shall propose and implement a plan to strengthen the capacity, as defined by competencies, skills, and organizational structure, of targeted local organizations to design and conduct evaluations and assessments. Core skills that should be taken into account include: quantitative (survey research and statistical analysis) and qualitative (including mixed) evaluation methods, planning (including logistics) evaluations, and evaluation report writing. <br /><br />Background<br />The Paris Declaration, Accra Accord, and Busan declaration on aid effectiveness have increased the importance of using quality independent evaluation results to make decisions. USAID Evaluation policy prioritizes building local evaluation capacity, and using local expertise in evaluations. In Peru, there are several organizations that can perform evaluations, and there is a network of consultants that have experience in evaluations. There is room, however, to strengthen competencies to meet the rigurosity, principles and standards that are now required by international organizations (e.g. World Bank, Development Assistance Committee-DAC) to evaluate development programs. <br />Activities:<br />The contractor will develop a plan with its approach to meet this objective, as well as measures of verification. The plan will include criteria to select the target organization(s), outline the areas to be improved and describe the methodology to do so. The plan will also propose the expected verifiable improvements that could be achieved in the targeted organizations. The Contractor will obtain USAID's approval prior to implementation of the plan. <br />Local Partnerships <br /><br />The Contractor must seek opportunities to the greatest extent possible to team with one or several local organizations to carry out the work expected under this contract.</p>
<p>Geographic Location <br />The Contractor shall perform the services in any of the geographic regions where USAID/Peru develops and implements its bilateral portfolio, and in any of the countries where USAID/Peru implements the South American Region portfolio. <br /><br />Coordination with the Government of Peru and Other Donors <br />Following Aid Effectiveness principles, the Contractor will work closely with USAID to ensure that the Government of Peru, in particular the Peruvian Agency for International Cooperation (APCI), and other donors are kept apprised of USAID's evaluation efforts and that, to the extent possible, evaluations shall be coordinated with other entities' efforts. <br /><br />Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian Considerations<br />The technical approach to every task order under this contract will integrate indigenous and Afro-Peruvian considerations into the design and implementation. Results and indicators will be, where appropriate, disaggregated by ethnicity to highlight discrepancies. <br /><br />Gender Requirements<br />USAID Gender Equality and Female's Empowerment policy integrates its principles into all the Agency's program cycle, including monitoring and evaluation. The Contractor should integrate gender as a cross-cutting consideration in the design and implementation of all activities under this contract. Technical assistance and training in monitoring and evaluation activities will take into account ADS 203.3.4.3. During evaluations and assessments the Contractor must address at least two questions: <br />(1) How gender relations have affected the achievement of sustainable results?" and (2) "How activities have affected the relative status of men and women?" The Contractor must be familiar with gender issues in South America. See link to the policy: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/policy_planning_and_learning/documents/GenderEqualityPolicy.pdf</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Columbia Environmental research Center has a requirement for analysis of abundance patterns of fish species in the Missouri river. The work will be required with the generalization of zero-inflated modeling approaches to include all the target species of the Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program (PSPAP), resulting in a comprehensive analysis of abundance patterns of these fish species in the Missouri river obtained using multiple gears over different segments of the river covering 2003-2010. Such comprehensive analysis has not been conducted in previous attempts of analyzing these data due to lack of viable statistical modeling approaches to deal with issues such as data with excess zero values and obtained using multiple gears. A multivariate extension of this modeling approach to study community level models for certain species (e.g., species with known predator-prey or competitor relationships) will be conducted to achieve better understanding of nature of the dependencies among these species.
Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the item specified as a sole source from Dr. Ali Arab, Georgetwon University  and proposes to negotiate with that entity on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business June 4, 2012 by 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time. This notice may represent the government's only official notice of this procurement.

<a href="mailto:arlene.fitzpatrick@usmc.mil">M6785412R7034 - Litter Movement Capability</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of addressing the need of moving injured Marines and their gear from the Point of Injury (POI) on the battlefield to either a Casualty Collection Point (CCP) or a Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ).  This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public 

The intent of this RFI is to assist MCWL in investigating potential candidate concepts, key and enabling technologies and technology development efforts that will enable fewer litter bearers to move casualties greater distances than can be accomplished using current devices.
 

Data compiled as a result of this RFI will be used to inform appropriate MCWL staff of technical and configuration options in the area of litter movement.  Any resultant purchases would be used to support MCWLs Experimental Campaign Plan (ECP) 2011-2015 with concept based experimentation and to determine what technology development investments might be appropriate for future Enhanced Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO).

MCWL seeks to determine the availability of technology and configuration options that address the need of moving injured Marines and their gear from the Point of Injury (POI) on the battlefield to either a Casualty Collection Point (CCP) or a Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) so that the injured may to be evacuated to a higher level of care.

Solutions should be man-packable or man-portable, have a capacity of transporting one (1) to two (2) casualties (up to 300 lbs.
 ea.), and enable casualty movement with a manpower ratio of one (1)litter bearer/one (1) casualty.  Solutions may be manual or powered, with a range of One (1) KM if manual, or ten (10) KM if powered.  Given the need for flexibility over a broad range of operational conditions, the specific requirements for the Litter Movement Capability have not been rigidly defined and are provided above as advisory only.

Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include:

1)	identification of your company or organization;
2)	your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements;
3)	business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact information;
4)	notification of business size and/or special status; and
5)	any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited.
 

Submissions shall be limited to two (2) pages, plus commercial marketing information or web links and all should be submitted via email to arlene.fitzpatrick@usmc.mil referencing the following tracking number: M67854-12-R-7034.  These should be submitted on or before 8 June 2012, 4 pm EST.  This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual responses should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.

Email questions to the point of contact (POC) noted above.  The deadline for submission of questions concerning this notice is Friday, 31 May 2012, 4 pm EST. The responses to all questions received by this date will be posted at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.
  Only unclassified data should be submitted. 

Following a review of the responses received, MCWL may elect to request additional information, or may schedule one-on-one meetings to gain additional information about proposed solution(s).

BACKGROUND: 

VA Dental Care serves as the foundation and first point of contact within the health care system for enrolled, eligible Veterans' dental needs. Dental benefits are provided by VA according to law. In some instances, VA is authorized to provide extensive dental care, while in other cases treatment may be limited. VA Medical Centers (VAMC) within each Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) refers dental laboratory work to VA CDL's to perform required services. In cases where the CDL's cannot meet the VAMC's demand contracted services are required to fulfill the need. 

OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE:
VA intends to contract with qualified dental laboratory clinics which will provide the following dental laboratory services: 
"	Fabrication of porcelain fused to metal crowns and fixed partial dentures
"	Fabrication of Full gold crowns and fixed partial dentures
"	Implant supported crowns and fixed partial dentures
"	Abutments
"	Resin-bonded bridges
"	Removable partial denture frameworks
"	Diagnostic wax-ups for crown and bridge (C&B) cases
"	Custom provisional C&B prostheses
"	All-ceramic C&B prostheses
"	Implant connecting bars (precious metal/titanium)
"	C&B metal/titanium/zirconium substructures
"	Application of veneering porcelain to existing/CDL submitted metal or ceramic C&B copings and fixed partial denture (FPD) structures.

<DESC>This 15 days synopsis is posted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.201.<br><br>The Army Contracting Command - National Capital Region (ACC-NCR) at Hoffman II, on behalf of the U.S. ARMY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGENCY(USAITA) intends to procure Defense Messaging System services. The intent of the USAITA is to be a customer-focused service provider that provides, manages, operates, and maintains Information Technology shared services for the Pentagon Area and select agencies and organizations in the National Capital Region (NCR). The Department of Defense Directive stated that USAITA was to be the central source for IT services, and therefore eliminate the requirement for each Department of Defense component to establish, operate and maintain duplicative technology. The policy also explicitly directed USAITA to manage costs, as the directive outlined the responsibility to operate as a business, and continually evaluate new commercial alternatives to providing existing capabilities in the interest of finding cost savings.<br><br>USAITA is a field-operating agency under the operational control of the Army's Office of the Administrative Assistant. USAITA is an Information Technology (IT) service provider, and provides a range of shared services to the National Defense community. USAITA's customer base consists primarily of Department of Defense services and agencies inside of the National Capital Region (NCR).<br><br>The United States Army Information Technology Agency (ITA) Operations (OPS) directorate pro-vides single integrated Organizational Messaging service for Army installations, Office Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the military services headquarters staffs, the White House, Combatant Commanders, Civil Departments and Agencies, Allies, and Foreign Embassies, in accordance with Congressional, OSD and Army direction. Congress assigned this mission to the Department of Defense (DOD). The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) assigned the Army as the Executive Agent. ITA Operations provides these services on three separate security enclaves: Top Secret Collateral, Secret, and Unclassified. The scope of ITA/OPS organizational messaging service includes time critical Nuclear Command and Control; Defense Messaging using the Defense Message System (DMS); National Gateway between world-wide DoD organizations using DMS and Civil Agencies, Allies and Foreign Embassies using other messaging systems; and Pentagon Enterprise E-Mail infrastructure and directories.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source  Event Planning Services for the 7th International Conference on Tularemia
<SOLNBR>FDA1101776
<RESPDATE>052512
<ARCHDATE>05262012
<CONTACT>Emily Hunt, Email emily.hunt@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to the Tularemia International Society in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1: only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. FDA requires an international and local organizing committee to make meeting arrangements, including providing web based services, speaker review services, and program content coordination for the International Conference on Tularemia.
<p>The Tularemia International Society (TULISOC) is the sole event planner of this unique meeting, which is held only once every three years. FDA considers this rare event to be critical to its mission. That is, the FDA has an ongoing, and even increasing, commitment to facilitating development of medical countermeasures for bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases. Advancing development of medical countermeasures is an explicit goal of this meeting. FDA views this as a rare and unique opportunity to interface with scientists, experts, panelists, policymakers, and other public and private industry leaders in this key area, which is assembled only every three years.</p>
<p>As with many professional scientific meetings, the 7th International Conference on Tularemia is intended to illuminate key issues in this fast moving research field. Specifically, the Conference is designed to bring together outstanding scientists worldwide studying pathogenesis, cell biology, genomics, proteomics, animal models, diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, clinical features, ecology, epidemiology and host response to Francisella. The meeting will be comprised of keynote speakers, invited oral presentations, oral presentations selected from abstracts, moderated discussions, and poster presentations. There are no other meetings which highlight and bring together researchers with like interests, and no alternatives to TULISOC for partners to organize this meeting. TULISOC is the lead organization, and only organization, that constituted an international and local organizing committee over two years ago to direct program and policy decisions for this international meeting.</p>
<p>FDA looks to forums like these to elucidate areas that continue to plague our citizenry and the world as a whole. The ability of FDA to establish a purchase order with TULISOC, an organization that has ability to bring together outstanding specialists in medical countermeasure product development, is the only path available to fulfilling these aspects of FDA's mission.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any party that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement as stated herein and in the attached Statement of Work (SOW) may submit a written capability statement that clearly supports and demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement. Capability statements must be received by the response date and time of this notice. Submissions will be reviewed to determine if they can meet the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted under negotiated procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13. This action incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-58, effective May 18, 2012. See uploaded SOW for a description of the requirement. Response Date: 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Daylight Time), May 25, 2012. Please email any responses to Emily Hunt at Emily.Hunt@fda.hhs.gov. Phone calls will not be accepted or returned.</p>

APPENDIX F:   Justification for Brand Name Products
Date:	May 21, 2012 Project:	Hammer Drill
1.	Identifications a.	Agency:  National Park Service b.	Contracting Office:	Denver MABO
2.	Description of the action being approved:
The National Park Service (NPS) shall be soliciting for a hammer drill which will drill through rock to use while working in the backcountry for remote trail work. The documents included with the solicitation call for specific brand name products that are peculiar to one manufacturer. This written justification provides approval for limiting competition to the listed brand name products as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
3.	Description of supplies and services:
Product: Vessel GT-5000HD	 Estimated price:  $4158.00 		 4.	Authority:	 a.	41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. b.	FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs. c.	FAR 6.302-1: The use of the name brand products are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

5.	The description of the product's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition:
Trail crews have been using Pionjar gas powered rock drills/jackhammers for decades. These drills flush drill cuttings from the hole using compressed exhaust gas from drill, creating a large plume of rock dust around drill site. A recent report from NIOSH has documented that the rock dust created by Piojnar rock drills poses a risk to employee health and requires mitigation. Trail crews still need to drill holes and excavate rock, and we are trying to find a machine that can do this without the dust and health risks of the Pionjar. The Vessel GT-5000HD has been field tested extensively by trail crews in Kings Canyon N.P. and Zion N.P. This drill meets the specifications outlined below.
-Non dust producing drill requiring no respirator -Under 40 pounds -Must be able to drill up to a 2 inch hole -A shell or frame preferably metal around engine to protect it -safety line attachment for hooking a safety line for fall protection when drilling at height. -Type 2 stroke, forced air cooled, single cylinder -Uses standard SDS drill bits -hp 2.3 at 7500 rpm
6.	Efforts to obtain competition: a.	Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: For acquisitions over $25,000 the solicitation will be issued on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov. b.	Presolicitation notice per FAR 5.2: For acquisitions over $25,000 a presolicitation notice shall be posted on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov unless the exception noted at FAR Part 5.202(a)(13) applies.
7.	Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable:
The Pionjar rock drill/jackhammer that this is meant to replace costs about $5000 (until recently, when manufacture of this machine was discontinued) The Vessel GT 5000HD costs  $4158.00
8.	Description of the market research conducted:
There are two general options for rock drilling without creating a dust plum; a portable generator powering a corded rotary hammer requiring oversized generators with less power output, or gasoline powered rotary hammers. Extensive internet research, vendor phone calls, and calls to other maintenance operations turned up only this one gas-powered rotary hammer that could drive the 2" diameter drill bits needed for trail work and meet the required specifications. 
9.	Other facts supporting other than full & open competition:
a.	Reason why documents suitable for full & open competition have not been developed: Refer to item 5 above. b.	Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government: Refer to item 5 above.
10.	Interested Sources:
VESSEL DRILL JDV Products Inc. 22-01 Raphael Street Fair Lawn NJ 07410    phone:201-796-1720 
11.	Actions, if any, to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions:
12.	Certifications:
a.	Technical / Requirements Certification:
I do hereby recommend the use of the Brand Name products noted above for the procurement noted above. I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  This is a notice of intent to award a sole source under statutory 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only one Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." 

The Department of Veterans Affairs, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital (JAHVH), 13000 Bruce B. Downs., Tampa, FL 33612 requirement is to develop, implement and install 5 Smart Homes systems for veterans in their homes. The Department of Veterans Affairs, James A. Haley Veterans Hospital (JAHVH) intends to make an award to Ubisense Inc, 5445 DTC Parkway, Denver, CO 80111.  Interested parties may e-mail LaVerne. Astroth@va.gov or fax (813) 979-3637, Attn: LaVerne Astroth, not later than Friday, 20 June 2012, 10:00 a.m. EST.

The proposed contract action is for the design/modify, install and maintain 5 Smart Homes into veterans' homes that is most beneficial to cognitively impaired polytrauma veterans and other veterans needing cognitive aids within the AT program. The Tampa Smart Home is a highly integrated system which is used to record and analyze movements of persons in 3-dimensional space inside the PTRP. It monitors patients and staff and provides interactive prompting via touch screen LCD panels in order to provide enhanced rehabilitative care.

The Smart Home has been fully integrated into the Tampa Assistive Technology (AT) program providing cognitive assistive technologies to Polytrauma and other cognitively impaired veterans. The original Tampa Smart Home was developed and designed by Ubisense Inc. as part of a contract in 2010. Ubisense was contracted to provide the hardware and software.  This is a major system that is highly specialized. Ubisense designed the LCD touch screens.  Ubisense, in partnership with Tampa VA staff designed the software to integrate prompting with the Ubisense location core services. The Smart Home software is separate to the core. The core software is used to calculate positions of objects in space using Ubisense ultra-wide band sensors (analogous to radar). The Smart Home software is integrated on top of the core software and interacts with patients depending on locations. Essentially the Smart Home software is the smarts that uses locations (core) to figure out what cognitive prompts to give patients.  Currently the length of the source code exceeds 500,000+ lines and is highly complex. The 5 Smart Homes systems will be based on technologies already in existence in the original Smart Home at the Tampa VA.  Some modifications to the technologies will be made to adapt to the different circumstances and needs of the individual veteran.
The NAICS code assigned to this acquisitions is 334290 with a size standard of 750 Empl.

Following a dialogue with the Administrator, TSA senior leadership will participate in several panel discussions focusing on strategically important efforts, including: Risk Based Security; Budget and Acquisition Landscape; and Information Technology and Analysis.</p>
<p>"Partnerships and industry engagement are important drivers of innovation at TSA," said Administrator Pistole. "Engaging with industry leaders through efforts such as this helps us achieve our goal of providing effective, efficient transportation security for all Americans."</p>
<p>The event will be held from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. at the Transportation Systems Integration Facility located at Washington D.C. Ronald Reagan National Airport.

<p>"WHSR strives to foster open dialogue and collaboration with DHS and its components," said Kay Olive, Director of WHSR. "We commend TSA on its unprecedented willingness to engage industry in this way and we are delighted to offer these forums."</p>
<p>The June 5 meeting is the first in a series of planned industry meetings which will feature TSA participation. The WSHR/TSA Senior Executive Industry Forum will also host multiple focus groups to engage TSA leadership and other TSA liaisons. These groups will meet regularly to provide industry prospective and ideas on a range of transportation security topics.</p>

Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

C.2 	GENERAL INFORMATION
C.2.1 	BACKGROUND  
The delivery of educational services to American Indian juveniles throughout Indian country is essential, not only to comply with Federal Mandates, but to build healthy and safe tribal communities.  The Tribal Law and Order Act; Sections 211 and 244 direct DOJ and DOI to create a "long-term plan to address incarceration in Indian country."  TLOA clearly states that other federal agencies are required to engage in partnerships with DOJ and DOI in meeting compliance.  
Federal mandates also make it very clear that the goal of rehabilitating our juveniles, should not involve mere incarceration, without engaging them in constructive activities and programming. As noted in the report submitted by DOJ and DOI in collaboration with the Work Group on Corrections, to the United States Congress, regarding TLOA, "BIA operational funding does not include programming needs such as behavioral health, public health, education, employment and life skills.  For these services, tribal corrections agencies should develop collaborative relationships with service providers including Indian Health Services (IHS), Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), tribal and state partners and volunteers to support institution based programming."
The targeted population consists of incarcerated male and female juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent, serving sentences and/or awaiting release from custody following completion of the sentence.  This includes juveniles who have been taken into custody and adjudicated as a result of tribal violations occurring in Indian country and within the Indian Tribe jurisdiction. The intent is to offer programs that enable the juveniles to strive toward completing high school graduation requirements and/or offering courses that enable the student to progress towards entering into the school upon release.

C.4  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS  
C.4.1 	Background Investigation
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Bureau of Indian Affairs; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.  Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C. 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including the Bureau of Indian Education or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to contract award the Acquisition Office will notify the resultant contractor to provide verification of favorable screening.  It is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA OJS in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation. If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a contract shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work.  The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for contract award.
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the contract may be terminated and the Contractor employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, if the service involves contact with or regular control over Indian children.
C.4.2	Non-Personal Services

Cross-referencing within a proposal volume is permitted where it would conserve space without impairing clarity. Failure to provide all requested information may render a proposal unacceptable.

Part 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
Factor 1: Section A, Past Performance: The Past Performance narrative shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary to fully explain the quoted past performance. The Government wants assurance past performance demonstrates the selected contractor exemplifies the capability of project execution and completion as described in this SOW. Examples must be recent, having been performed in the last five (5) years. The offeror must describe how its past performance is on a scale similar in size to this requirement. The strength of the offeror's response will be based on the implementation of psychological services and benefits/achievement(s) of students who have received psychological services. Provide reference and phone numbers of CORs/points-of-contact from past contracts.
Factor 2: Section A: Technical Approach. The Government has intentionally described its requirement through the Statement of Work to solicit the expertise of industry to construct an offer it believes will best achieve the performance.  (1) The Technical Approach shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary, but limited to page constraints to fully explain the quoted technical approach. (2) The technical quote should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work to be performed and include measurable performance standards by which performance will be evaluated for determining whether the offeror performed successfully. (3) The quote shall include the offeror's understanding of the Bureau of Indian Education's, goals for the project and an understanding of the SOW. (4) The technical approach should include, but is not be limited to the following: (a) A description of the processes the offeror routinely uses to provide psychological services. (b) A description of conditions which can affect achieving the stated performance 	objectives.
Factor 2: Section B: Key Personnel: The contractor shall demonstrate knowledge and experience by submitting resume(s) for key personnel. Key personnel are defined as those individuals the offeror views as essential to successfully performing its proposal technical approach.  The offeror shall provide copies of state issued licenses of key personnel who will be performing psychological services at San Felipe Pueblo Elementary School, San Felipe Pueblo, New Mexico.
Factor 2: Section C: Experience/Industry Knowledge: The offeror shall describe the relevance of the past performance to be provided under Section A: Past Performance. Specifically, the contractor shall demonstrate its knowledge of psychological services.  The offeror must demonstrate their experience and knowledge to positive improvement and/or successful results of students who have received psychological services, without revealing the personal identity of students.  
Part II: PRICE The Government will evaluate each offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness. The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 
The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options. Price quotes shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1.	Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc); 2.	Indirect cost elements, (e.g. labor overhead, general and administrative expense, etc), and profit.  3.	Inclusive of any Federal, State, and Local taxes, in accordance with FAR 52.229-04 and FAR                52.229-10.  
The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the realism of the offeror's price and to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.  The Government, at a minimum, expects a payment schedule that is on a firm fixed price to include hourly rates, daily rates, preparation rates with number of days, taxes, and travel. Offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor, if applicable. The Department of Labor, Wage Determination No. 2005-2362, Revision No. 12, Date of 6/13/2011 is applicable in the State of New Mexico. Other applicable Wage Determination rates may be provided by the Contracting Officer if a written request is submitted to the Contracting Officer 10 days prior to the closing of the RFP. The offeror has public access at http://www.wdol.gov/ to locate the prevailing wage rates for their area.  
4. Proposal Acceptance Period Notwithstanding FAR clause 52.212-1, the proposal acceptance period is 90 days after the date set for receipt of proposals. The Offeror shall make a clear statement in the proposal cover page that the proposal is valid until this period has ended.
5. Proposal Preparation Costs The Government will not be obligated to pay any costs incurred by an offeror in the preparation and submission of a proposal in response to this RFP.
SECTION M - EVALUATION CRITERIA
SECTION M - FAR 52.212-02 Evaluation -Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  This is a best value award, and the evaluation criteria for this award is specified below. The Government will use the offeror's proposal as a representation of how the offeror will meet the Government's requirements. The Government will compare the offeror's proposed plans and other areas of the offeror's proposal to evaluate the offeror's overall likelihood to successfully meeting the requirements stated herein.
1.               The Government reserves the right to make award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in your proposal, if any are omitted your response may be non-responsive and not evaluated.  If exchanges are necessary, the Government will conduct these exchanges consistent with FAR 15.306 Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals. 
2.	 An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract or purchase order from the Federal Government pursuant to FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008). 
3. 	The source selection will be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Parts 15.3 and 12.6, with the intention to award a single fixed price contract with option periods.
4. 	The evaluation of factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. 
5. 	Evaluation Scoring: The Government will evaluate all offerors according to the evaluation criteria. Each Non-Price Factor will be rated with a color-point system. Blue (50 pts)	Outstanding - The response is very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear. Proposal consistently meets the solicitation requirements with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.
Green (30pts)	Excellent - Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.
Orange (15 pts)	Satisfactory - The response generally meets requirements but there is no expectation of better than acceptable performance.  Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without minor revision to the proposal.
Yellow ( 5pts)	Poor - The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revision to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.
Red (0 pts) 	Unsatisfactory - Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

DESCRIPTION: Occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistants are part of the education team within a school district.  The profession of occupational therapy is concerned with a person's ability to participate in desired daily life activities or "occupations".  In the schools, occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children to be prepared for and perform important learning and school related activities and to fulfill their role as students.  In this setting, occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants support academic outcomes including social skills, math, reading, writing, recess, participation in sports, self-help skills, prevocational/vocational participation and more, for children and students with disabilities, 3 to 21 years of age.  They are particularly skilled in facilitating access to curricular and extra-curricular activities for all students through supports, design planning, and other methods.

An occupational therapist is a trained health care professional that uses purposeful, goal directed activities and task analysis to enable children with a disability to benefit from their individualized education programs (IEP's).  Federal law mandates that occupational therapy (OT) in the school system be educationally relevant.  In the school setting, Occupational therapy is a "related service" to special education under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act.  This means services must enhance or support educational goals as stated on the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP).  Occupational Therapists in the school setting look at certain skills issues which may interfere with a child's educational performance such as hand function, oral motor function, visual motor and perceptual skills, sensory awareness/processing, self-care and pre-vocational tasks.  These areas can be addressed through a variety of intervention strategies, which may include direct therapy with the child, consultation with the teacher, modification of the environmental, provision of adaptive equipment, and staff training.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2852.223-70, Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material<br /></span>(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls. <br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure. <br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working. <br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (OCT 2005)<br /></span>Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer.

<p><a name="PD000021"></a>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 10)</p>
<p><br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br /><br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly S. Snyder</p>
<p>8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103</p>
<p>USAFA, CO 80840</p>
<p>Telephone number 719-333-2074</p>
<p>FAX 719-333-9018</p>
<p>email:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><br />DLA Energy on behalf of the US Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) plans to award an ESPC TO using the DOE Super ESPC IDIQ contracts. DLA Energy invites the current 16 ESPC holders to submit a written response to this Notice of Opportunity for our consideration. Only those 16 DOE ESPC awardees are eligible for award. <br /><br />The Kwajalein Atoll is part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). A number of the atoll's islands are operated by the U.S. military under a long term lease with the Republic of the Marshall Islands. This ESPC includes facilities on the islands of Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and Meck. Under this ESPC, USAKA seeks mainly to reduce the consumption of electricity on the order of 50%, but is also to a lesser degree interested in increasing utilization of renewable energy operating or capable of operating on microgrids and reducing the use of potable water. USAKA seeks this project to not only meet federal efficiency and renewable mandates, but also to meet US Army Net Zero energy goals.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The Forest Legacy Program (FLP) is authorized by the 1990 Farm Bill, which amended the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the FLP to protect environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to non-forest uses. FLP was amended by the 1996 Farm Bill to allow for grants to the States.
<p>Through FLP, the Forest Service provides grants to State agencies (typically the State Forestry Agency) to protect important forests through conservation easements (Approx. 65% of all FLP projects) and fee-simple purchases (Approx. 35% of all FLP projects).</p>
<p>As required in the FLP Guidelines, the Forest Service conducts quality assurance oversight reviews to ensure the State agency's appraisals are in compliance with the federal appraisal requirements. FS established the Quality Assurance Inspection (QAI) process to conduct such oversight reviews. To date, FS personnel have conducted the reviews using internal resources. FS is exploring the possibility of contractors conducting this function.</p>
<p>The anticipated scope of work would entail reviewing documentation, reviewing processes by conducting in-person or virtual interviews with State agency staff, reviewing files, and preparing a report of findings and recommendations focused on improving the State's processes.</p>
<p>FS seeks contractors with experience and expertise in all of the following:<br />&bull; Conducting oversight reviews in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA or "Yellow Book") and the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).<br />&bull; Completing real estate appraisals and/or reviews of conservation easements.</p>
<p>FS requires contractor personnel to have the following certifications:<br />&bull; State General Appraiser Certification<br />&bull; Certificate of Completion of a UASFLA Seminar (as student or instructor)<br />&bull; Certificate of Completion of Conservation Easement Appraisal coursework (student or instructor)<br />&bull; Appraisal Professional Designation or Accreditation</p>

This fleet, as well as various support vessels, requires an Oil Analysis Program of which this contract for Laboratory Services will be a part of. The NDRF is divided into various subsets that are managed differently depending on the<br />program that it supports. The subsets are: The Ready Reserve Force (RRF), Schoolships, Missile Defense Agency Support (RRF-Like) and Fleet Support Craft.<br />1.1.1 The Ready Reserve Force (RRF) is a key element of strategic sealift. The RRF also provides humanitarian support in the event of natural disasters, extreme weather events, and other such circumstances that warrant vessel activation. The RRF is structured to transport military equipment and provide initial re-supply for forces deploying anywhere in the world. The ships are maintained and operated by commercial ship management companies under contract to the MARAD. At present the RRF fleet consists of 48 vessels maintained in a determined state of readiness located at various ports throughout the United Sates on the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Coasts.<br />1.1.2 There are 7 vessels serving as training vessels for the nation's Maritime Academies. These vessels are located in; Castine, ME; Buzzards Bay, MA; Brooklyn, NY; Kings Point, NY; Traverse City, MI; Galveston, TX; and Vallejo, CA and operate worldwide.<br />1.1.3 There are 2 vessels supporting the Missile Defense Agency that are currently located in Portland, OR. and also operate worldwide. They are maintained and operated similar to the RRF.<br />1.1.4 MARAD currently maintains three lay-up fleets located at James River, VA; Beaumont, TX; and Suisan Bay, CA. These fleets have a number of fleet support craft that may require testing both on a scheduled program and an ad hoc basis. These vessels are new to the program and maintenance and operational details are not yet developed.<br />1.2MARAD Oil Analysis Program<br />1.2.1 The MARAD Oil Analysis Program, currently in place for the RRF and RRF-Like vessels, serves as a necessary component of a mandated Preventive Maintenance Plan (PMP). This program serves all the vessels in the RRF/RRF-Like and is managed from the Office of Ship Operations, located at MARAD Headquarters in Washington, DC. The function of this program is for the vessel's personnel to take oil samples under prescribed operating conditions and time frames and mail these samples to an approved oil sampling laboratory for expert analysis to assist and determine the conditions of the identified machinery. The results of this analysis are then received by the vessel, vessel ship managers, vessel COTR and the Oil<br />Analysis Program Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). Any action as required by the results of the analysis will be carried out by vessel personnel or a vessel designate.<br />1.2.2 The MARAD Oil Analysis Program currently in place for the Schoolship vessels serves as a necessary component of a mandated Preventive Maintenance Plan (PMP) and/or is part of vessel Guidance provided by MARAD to the schools.

<p>All CLINS are to be priced in accordance with the Product Specification.</p>
<p>PRODUCT SPECIFICATION:<br />For: Mine Emergency Operations Deployable Laboratory Bench-top Gas Chromatograph</p>
<p>Justification:<br />The analysis of gas samples via gas chromatography is critical to the safety and health of the nation's miners and MSHA personnel involved with mine recovery operations during and after a mine emergency operations (MEO) event. By measuring the concentrations of various gases contained in the collected samples, MSHA gains valuable insight into the events and conditions occurring in the mine environment. During MEO mine recoveries, several thousand samples are collected and analyzed by gas chromatography. Due to the importance of the information collected from these instruments, it's vital that all criteria for performance be met or exceeded.</p>
<p>Specifications:<br />Must be able to meet the detection limits of:<br />Nitrogen 100 ppm<br />Oxygen 100 ppm<br />Carbon dioxide 100 ppm<br />Argon 100ppm<br />Methane 0.5 ppm<br />Hydrogen 0.5 ppm<br />Carbon monoxide 0.5 ppm<br />Acetylene 0.5 ppm<br />Ethylene 0.5 ppm<br />Ethane 0.5 ppm</p>
<p>These detection limits must remain accurate for samples collected in:<br />1. fresh air - 20.95% oxygen, 78% nitrogen<br />2. mine gas - 95% methane<br />3. fire suppression gases - 70% carbon dioxide or 99% nitrogen</p>
<p>Must be able to quantify within the following limits:<br /><br />Nitrogen 1000 ppm to 100% <br />Oxygen 1000 ppm to 21% <br />Carbon dioxide 1000 ppm to 70%<br />Argon 1000 ppm to 1% <br />Methane 1 ppm to 100%<br />Hydrogen 1 ppm to 5% <br />Carbon monoxide 1 ppm to 10% <br />Acetylene 1 ppm to 1%<br />Ethylene 1 ppm to 1%<br />Ethane 1 ppm to 10%</p>
<p><br />These quantification limits must be for samples collected in:<br />1. fresh air - 20.95% oxygen, 78% nitrogen<br />2. mine gas - 95% methane<br />3. fire suppression gases - 25% carbon dioxide or 99 % nitrogen<br /><br />The instrument and all associated electronics/equipment must be constructed in such a way as to be able to withstand considerable shaking/vibration during transport to mine sites in a Mobile Gas Laboratory.</p>
<p>The analysis time shall not exceed 13 minutes for the complete suite of gases listed above and the analysis temperature shall remain isothermal during the analysis (no ramping of temperature during the analysis).</p>
<p>The instrument shall operate on no more than 20 Amp, single phase, 110 Volts AC power.</p>
<p>The instrument shall not exceed 19" high by 24" deep. The total length of the monitor, instrumentation, and PC controller shall not exceed 60".</p>
<p>Any packed column configuration can be used that can separate and analyze the above stated compounds at the concentrations listed. At least one column network shall be used to separate the permanent gases (hydrogen, argon, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane) and at least one column network to separate methane, carbon dioxide, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. Each network shall interface with an independent thermal conductivity detector (TCD), after the TCD no additional detectors should follow. A flame ionization detector and methanizer can be used to quantify low levels of hydrocarbons and CO2. A reducing compound photometer or a pulse discharge detector may be used on an additional column network to quantify lower levels of the permanent gases.</p>
<p>Utilizing a valve/injector and multiport/pre-column assembly the gas chromatograph must be able to scrub/vent off any moisture, sulfur compounds and hydrocarbon compounds with carbon chains greater than C2Hn. The pre-columns shall not exceed 2 feet in length.</p>
<p>The gas chromatograph shall have programmable independent flows to all columns and pre-columns.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity detectors that utilize a single filament with an alternating sample flow / reference flow shall be used; however, the detectors must be rugged and be able to run on UHP carrier gas. Only UHP helium and argon are acceptable.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the analytical results is within &plusmn;5% and the precision is within &plusmn;5% or better.</p>
<p>PC based instrument control software must be able to communicate/export sample result data to a .CSV format for data reduction and management via dynamic data exchange. As a minimum, the samples are defined as peak name, peak area, retention time, amount, height, and sample ID/file name.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined/solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NIAIDNOI12092 and the solicitation is being issued as a Notice of Intent to procure on a sole source basis. This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-59, May 15, 2012). This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intend to procure from BECKMAN COULTER, INC., 250 South Kraemer Boulevard, Brea, CA 92821-6232; The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516; which has a business size standard of 500M; The following requirements are for: 3) Optima XE - 90K - IVD, Item #A99833, the trade-in of L8 series ultracentrifuges, serial #7H752 and #6J763. This instrument is manufactured by BECKMAN COULTER, INC., and is the only vender will satisfy agency's requirements: a) Equipment must be compatible and safety-tested with existing NIAID Beckman ultracentrifuge rotors. Ultracentrifuge must be warranted, tested and approved to run with existing rotors according to rotor manufacturer specifications and rotor user manuals. No special Compatibility Warranties are acceptable. b) Must have Dynamic Rotor Inertia Check (DRIC), or equivalent. In addition to speed disks, DRIC is a secondary safety measure ensures that rotors are not run above their rated speed. During initial acceleration, DRIC measures the rotor inertia and calculates the total rotor energy for the speed set by the user. If the calculated rotor energy is excessive, the instrument stops the run to avoid possible damage. This essential feature provides the highest level of safety for NIAID laboratory personnel and prolongs the life of the ultra.<br />c) Must have 15" LCD display with &plusmn; 45&deg; horizontal and vertical tilt for easy operation (even with gloved hands) and viewing from virtually anywhere in the lab.<br />d) Must operate at a noise level below 51 dBa. <br />e) Must achieve vacuum level below 5 microns (0.7 Pa).<br />f) Must consume no more than 60W of power while in idle mode. <br />g) Must have available Near Vertical Tube (NVT) rotors to maximize lipoprotein and plasmid DNA separations for speed and purity.<br />h) Must have tube sealing without crimp tool or torque wrench. Must have Opti-Seal (for easy sealing without tools), Quick-Seal (fast heat-sealing), and g-Max (shortens separation times by up to 50 percent) Tubes or equivalents.<br />i) Must have regenerative power ability to return power to buildings power grid when decelerating.<br />j) Must have 2 temperature sensors for redundant and accurate temperature monitoring for sample integrity.<br />k) Must automatically restart and complete run after a power outage.<br />l) Must have a power tolerance of 180-264V.<br />m) Must have speed control of &plusmn; 2 rpm at steady state and temperature control of &plusmn; 0.5oC after equilibrium. Speeds must be accurately reproducible between runs and temperature must be strictly controlled to preclude sample degradation during run.<br />n) Must have an air-cooled direct drive system that requires no gears, brushes, oil vacuum seal, external oil reservoir, or continuously-operating damper. This provides efficient operation and extends the life of the instrument. Air cooling eliminates chlorofluorocarbons and compressors which results in less instrument down time and less output of heat and noise. Software must have multiple languages for easy, error-free operation, with the option to select other languages including: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, Korean, and Russian.<br />o) Must have on-screen, context-sensitive help.<br />p) Must be able to export run data in .xml and .csv format to Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet formats through a standard USB port to a flash drive.<br />q) Must have on-screen information on chemical compatibility with centrifugation tubes and accessories.<br />r) Must have on-board operator's manual, rotor catalog &amp; accessories catalogs.<br />s) Must have (3) USB ports to allow data export to a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.<br />t) Must not be more than 32.5" deep after installation and occupy the same space as existing L8 series ultracentrifuge to keep equipment room and lab space unobstructed. <br />u) Must remove and dispose of the ultracentrifuges in place.

<p>6. Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. Corrosion is expected on equipment to be repaired under this contract.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated by reference. Addendum 52.212-2 Paragraph (a): Award will be based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.

<DESC>The Omaha District, US Army Corps of Engineers is seeking qualified members of the Small Businesses Community that qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238320 - Painting and Wall Covering Contractors.<br><br>On or around 8 June 2012, the Omaha district will advertise Phase 1 of a Two Phase Best Value Design-Build Request for Proposal project valued from approximately $7.5 to $10.0M.  The Phase 1 solicitation will close on or about 29 June 2012.<br><br>In Phase 1 of the 2 phase design-build selection procedure, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "offerors") submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction contract resulting from this solicitation.

Site visit information, including date, time and meeting location, will be provided to the Phase 2 Offerors in the Phase 2 RFP.<br><br>Project Description:<br><br>Work shall include the complete rehabilitation of steel vertical lift gates at Fort Peck Dam, Montana.  There are 16 gates that measure 40 feet wide by 25 feet high.    <br><br>Work shall include but not be limited to: visual Hydraulic Steel Structure (HSS) inspection of stoplogs and vertical lift gates, 3-D modeling and analysis utilizing STAAD.Pro software, non-destructive testing, structural repair design, welding (per AWS D1.5M/D1.5), corrosion repair, sandblasting, lead-based paint removal over/near water, wire rope replacement, concrete spall repair, gate seal replacement, concrete construction joint material replacement, cathodic protection removal and installation, and design and replacement of hoist controls and switches.  This work may be subcontracted out to other specialty contractors, as required. <br><br>The Fort Peck project office has one set of spillway stoplogs (16 total measuring 4 feet high by 43 feet wide).  There is the potential that only one or two gates can be isolated at a time due to stoplog configurations.  Therefore, work shall be sequenced to be performed while the stoplogs are in place.  The contractor shall have the option of fabricating temporary stoplog structures and/or working multiple shifts.      <br><br>Painting work shall include sandblasting spillway gates and associated features to commercial blast, preparing the final surface to SSPC 5 (white metal) and final coating the gates with a vinyl (5-E-Z) coating system with a zinc primer.  Work may require the use of scaffolding, snooper crane and harness access.  Contractor shall be responsible for dewatering, if required.  There will be approximately 1000 square feet of paint required per side per gate with additional quantities for other related features.

<AWARDEE>Palmetto GBA, 17 Technology Circle, Columbia, SC 29202 US
<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Palmetto GBA under the current contract number HHSM-500-2010-M0001Z in the amount of $40,310 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>
