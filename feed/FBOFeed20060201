<RESPDATE>031806
<ARCHDATE>05172006
<CONTACT>annette.fleming, 916-557-6882
<DESC>The intended modification is a follow on to an ongoing contract. Restoration Resources is currently on-site performing maintenance on the 35-acre mitigation site in accordance with the terms and conditions of DACW05-02-C-0018, Mitigation Planting and  Establishment, Kaweah River, Tulare County, California. The Government requires an additional 4.65 acres of riparian mitigation. Modification will install 810-seedlings, additional fencing, and irrigation system, signage, and provide for watering and weed ing of the seedlings for 3-years.  The crux of the issue is how to water the additional 4.65 acres. The 4.65 acres is located in a seasonal flood area and therefore a water well cannot be reasonably installed at that location, preventing watering of the pl antings. Discussions with the local sponsor and in-house staff feel it highly unlikely that a well containing an adequate water supply for the additional 4.65 acres could be found. The original 35-acre site has a water well is currently being operated by R estoration Resources or Rocklin, California. The water well is capable of supplying the required amount of water for the plantings on the additional 4.65 acre site. Restoration Resources in addition to operating the well is responsible for its maintenance and proper functioning through 2008.  It would be complicated and problematic for two different Contractors to utilize the well for two separate pieces of property. It would also be difficult to maintain due to responsibility and liability of potential dam ages to its well casing, pumps, and other equipment necessary for its proper function failed. The anticipated value of the award is $335,000.00. The anticipated award date is 20 March 2006. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation w hich shall be considered by the agency. See Government Wide Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for a contractor to provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, transportation, and supervision to perform riverbank stabilization on the Valley Railway in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Summit County, Ohio. The work consists of repairing and stabilizing the bank of the Cuyahoga River directly below the Valley Railway at Milepost 52.47.  The toe of the railroad embankment was severly eroded during the record storm event of July 2003 and subsequent floods causing the embankment to fail. This failed embankment supports the Valley Railway's ballast and rail and could lead to eventually derailment of a passenger train. The project includes addition of stone rip rap to stabilize the toe of the slope and bio-soil engineering to protect the embankment against further damage as well as adding natural vegetated cover to enhance aquatic habitat.  The project performance period is 150 calendar days after issuance of the notice to proceed. The NAICS code is 237990. The small business size standard is $28.5 million. The estimated price range for this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. This project is being solicited and awarded in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, Public Law 100-656. Accordingly, it is open to both small and large businesses. The solicitation with specifications, drawings, bid schedule, and wage rates, will be posted to the websites http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about February 15, 2006. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued. To receive the Invitation for Bid package you must download it from http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), located in Ann Arbor, MI, intends to acquire, on a competitive basis, a research study  designed to improve the methods and tools used by the Agency to estimate emissions from nonroad equipment. Data to be collected include populations, usage rates (activity) and in-use or real-world emission rates. This study will combine rapid in-use measurement capability with statistical survey design to improve the representation of nonroad engine populations. Performance of field work will involve the installation and operation of portable on-board instruments to measure exhaust emissions and equipment usage. Data will be collected during normal operation at participants? facilities or work sites. Prior to and during field work, statistical sampling will be applied to randomize the  recruitment and screening of participants and the selection of equipment pieces. Emissions and usage will be measured using portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) and portable activity measurement systems (PAMS), respectively. The PEMS will measure carbon dioxide (CO2) and several air pollutants on an continuous basis during normal operation over a period of one to three days. Air pollutants to be measured include carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The PAMS will measure engine on/off over a period of approximately three months. The target population includes nonroad equipment used by commercial establishments in the Mining, Construction, Manufacturing and Agricultural sectors. The study area for this collection will be EPA Region 7, which includes the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. To estimate the prevalence of equipment ownership in the target sectors, 1,540 establishments will be requested to respond to brief interviews regarding their equipment ownership and use. The total sample size for instrumented measurement is 360 equipment pieces, with 150 and 210 pieces targeted for emissions and usage measurement, respectively.  Following quality-assurance and analysis, the data will be stored in OTAQ?s Mobile Source Observation Database. This requirement is BRAND NEW. There is no predecessor contract. The solicitation will be issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. EPA anticipates the award of a single firm-fixed-price type contract. The period of performance will be for 20 months from the date of award. EPA anticipates an award around December 15, 2005.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to a current contract with the National Academy of Science’s National Research Council (NRC) to provide additional research associates needed to perform research in various NOAA laboratories to support mission essential research projects and programs.  Proposed contract modification to be negotiated is to increase the level of effort by adding 38 additional research associates to the base year and four one-year options.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Under the congressional charter, NRC currently serves as an independent advisor to the Federal government on scientific and technical questions of national importance and operates as a nonprofit organization bringing the resources of the scientific and technical community to bear on national problems through its volunteer advisory committees.  The program administration includes identifying research associates in the fields of Meteorology, Climate and Air Quality, Earth Science, Hydrology, Oceanography, Limnology, Space Sciences, Fisheries and Marine Mammals, Toxicology and Molecular Biology; processing applications; and establishing or renewing sub-agreements for research associates.  NRC manages a quality program that attracts the brightest scientists in the world and draws on a vast resource of thousands of NRC panelists who are experts in their respective fields.  This resource base significantly enhances NRC’s ability to conceptually review and evaluate the scientifically diverse applications received and to minimize the margin of error associated with accurately assessing the prospective applicants’ abilities to produce the highest quality work during their tenure.  The program conducted by the Academy cannot be duplicated as the existing level of expertise and prestige could not be garnered from any other sources. Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide written evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by February 14, 2006.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed modification is based upon the written responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to an announcement previously posted on 1/27/06.  PLEASE NOTE CHANGES FROM INITIAL POSTING IN CAPITAL LETTERS.  This is a SOURCES-SOUGHT synopsis.  The General Services Administration is seeking Repair and Alteration Services for Real Property (Government-owned and leased space) on an indefinite-quantity (as-needed) basis.  The services will be required primarily in Federal Buildings and U.S. Courthouses located in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, in New York State.  The work involves repairs and alterations to the interior of buildings and includes, but is not limited to, demolition of interior building components; installation of duct work; construction of partitions, doors, and frames; installation of acoustical ceilings; removal and installation of ceiling and floor tile;  installation of carpet and floor systems; removal and installation of various electrical devices and components; installation of copper tubing and check valves for domestic water supply; and interior painting.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT FOR A SPECIFIC PROJECT; THIS WILL BE AN INDEFINITE-QUANTITY (OPEN-ENDED) CONTRACT AND THE VARIOUS FIRMS AWARDED CONTRACTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPETE FOR PROJECTS THAT WILL ARISE DURING THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT.  The contractor must be capable of performing at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.  The contractor must also be capable of performing several projects concurrently; projects may range from $2,000.00 to approximately $2,470,000.00 (GSA Prospectus Level).  The contractor will be required to furnish a bid bond and performance and payment bonds on projects over $25,000.00.  The intended term of the contract is one-year with four 1-year options.  The Government intends to award multiple contracts for this solicitation.  YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO SERVE AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR ON EACH PROJECT YOU ARE AWARDED.  AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR, YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO PERFORM CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE WORK (INCLUDING PROVIDING A PROJECT SUPERINTENDENT) WITH YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES, AND TO SUBCONTRACT FOR THE REMAINING PORTIONS (SPECIALIZED TRADES) OF THE PROJECT.  AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT (THE WORK OF ALL TRADES).  The Government intends to set aside the procurement to small business concerns only (concerns whose average annual revenue for the previous 3 fiscal years does not exceed $31 million - under NAICS 236220).  The Government further intends to have partial set asides for one or more of the following categories: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses ("SDVOSB"), HUBZone Small Businesses ("HUBZone"), and 8(a) Concerns.  A partial set-aside will be made if there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining responsive offers from two or more responsible/capable concerns within these categories at fair market prices.  The Government may issue a single partial set-aside comprising one or more of these categories or issue separate, individual partial set-asides for one or more of these categories.  SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS WHICH DO NOT FIT EITHER OF THESE CATEGORIES WILL STILL BE ELIGIBLE TO BID ON THE SOLICITATION.  To determine the feasibility of one or more of these set asides, ALL INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS (not only those that are SDVOSB, HUBZone, or 8(a)) are requested to submit qualifications showing evidence of their capability to perform successfully as GENERAL CONTRACTOR on various concurrent repair and alteration projects.  PLEASE SUBMIT A LIST OF RELEVANT PROJECTS (WITHIN THE PAST 5 YEARS).  INCLUDE DATES, PROJECT DESCRIPTION, PROJECT LOCATION, DOLLAR AMOUNT, AND POINT OF CONTACT.  BE SURE TO ALSO IDENTIFY IF YOU SDVOSB, HUBZone, AND/OR 8(a).  See FAR 19.1403 for eligibility requirements as SDVOSB; see FAR 19.1303 for eligibility as certified HUBZone; and see FAR 19.802 for eligibility as certified 8(a).  Submit qualifications AND STATEMENT OF WHETHER YOU ARE SDVOSB, HUBZone, AND/OR 8(a), NOT LATER THAN FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2006, to: Scott D. Starkman, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Federal Center Service Center (2PMC-F), 26 Federal Plaza, Room 16-124, New York, NY 10278.  Any questions, please call (212) 264-2759.  Please no fax or email submissions.  THIS IS A SOURCES-SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  THERE ARE NO BID DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>This amendment cancels this requirement in its entirety.  The Chemical Munitions Agency (CMA) has announced that the Chemical Agent Munitions Disposal System (CAMDS) (Deseret Chemical Depot) is scheduled to close 1 Oct 2008, as a result of the final Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions.  Due to this short schedule, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to extend the existing contracts for the interim period of time until closure is completed.

<DESC>This announcement is changed to be for Competitive 8(a) only.  The requirements to perform decommissioning, demolition and debris removal operations other than 8(a) will be made under separate solicitations. SBA Louisiana District Office has restrict ed the 8(a) Competitive requirements to 8(a) firms that are located within its geographical boundaries.  The Government intends to award the aforementioned group under the existing solicitation number as award for a minimum of 3 Firm-fixed-price Indefinite  Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for a total pool not-to exceed $45,000,000.  These contracts will be for a one year Base and a one year option period.  These requirements are solicited under NAICS code 238910 and defined as having average an nual receipts of less than $13 million for the past 3 years.  This requirement is processed under Service Contract Act (SCA), therefore, this construction NAICS code applies as a matter of conformance for applicable wage rates.  Phase II for HubZones and P hase III for unrestricted as previously publicized for restriction to Louisiana firms will be processed at a later date as separate solicitations.  Individual task orders will be competition among the 8(a) awardees.  Bonding will be required based on the o utstanding amount of the task orders and not on the total pooled amounts.  A pre-conference meeting will be held on February 22, 2006 at 10:30 am CST at USACE LA-RFO, 1900 N. Lobdell Blvd., Baton Rouge , LA  70608.

This does not includes final disposition of such items as boats and cars.  The contractor shall grade surface to acceptable levels after demolition.  It is also anticipated that asbestos abatement  work may be required on certain structures prior to demolition as part of the decommissioning process.  Sorting of asbestos debris and placement on right of way for proper disposal will be required.  Woody debris will be kept segregated from construction/ demolition (C&D) debris as much as possible. Woody debris includes vegetative debris and clean woody C&D debris, (i.e., not pressure-treated wood or wood with significant painted surfaces). The contractor shall repair all roadways, sidewalks, utilities, dr ainage structures and other features not designated for demolition or removal, if damaged by Contractor operations and re-slope to original grade.

<CONTACT>Margaret Kirkpatrick Contract Specialist 9169785136     mkirkpatrick@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a market survey in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 to obtain feedback from industry regarding the general requirements for an upcoming procurement.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties in the intended procurement to rehabilitate the radial gates at the Delta Cross Channel.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, ALL interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  Therefore, replies are requested from all interested parties, regardless of business size or category.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this not later than February 13, 2006 to Margaret Kirkpatrick, U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, Acquisition Services, 2800 Cottage Way, Room E-1815, Sacramento, California 95825-1898.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  Interested parties should submit a capabilities package not longer than 5 pages demonstrating the ability to perform the summaries of work listed below.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Business name, address, CAGE code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (e.g., HUBZone), and a point of contract, (2) a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone small business concern, (3) a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor and (4) evidence of your experience performing work similar in type and scope to include:  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers and past experience regarding the construction or rehabilitation of concrete dams of similar type work described above within the past 3 years.  In addition, include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform required work.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  Responsible sources having relevant experience may submit their statement of interest and capabilities via email to mkirkpatrick@mp.usbr.gov not later than 4:00 P.M. (local time), February 13, 2006. All work required for Delta Cross Channel Rehabilitation is to be performed and completed within 210 calendar days from the date of issuance of the Notice to Proceed.  The performance period includes scheduled outage periods.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 and the related small business size standard in millions of dollars is $28.5.  However, the government reserves the right to changes the classification if deemed necessary.  The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in June 2006.   The proposed summary of construction work includes the following actions:  rehabilitate the two (2) 60-foot by 30-foot radial gates at the floodgate structure of the Delta Cross Channel, clean, grit blast, and paint the exterior surfaces including lifting brackets, clevises, equalizing bars and exposed areas of trunnion anchors, and the inside face of gate access hole covers, furnish and install new sacrificial anodes, replace all side seal clamp bars, side seals, exterior end plates, and associated nuts and bolts, and replace roller guide assemblies with redesigned assemblies.

The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program was established by the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). The program is implemented by a joint OFPP and SBA Policy Directive and Implementation Plan, dated May 25, 1999. The program consists of two major components--
(a) Unrestricted competition in designated industry groups; and
(b) Enhanced small business participation in 10 agency targeted industry categories.
19.1002 -- Definitions.
“Emerging small business,” as used in this Subpart, means a small business concern whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to a contracting opportunity.
“Emerging small business reserve amount,” for the designated groups described in 19.1005, means a threshold established by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of—
(1) $25,000 for construction, refuse systems and related services, nonnuclear ship repair, landscaping and pest control services; and
(2) $50,000 for architectural and engineering services.
19.1003 -- Purpose.
The purpose of the Program is to --

<SUBJECT>D -- The Emergency Managers Weather Information Notification System (EMWIN)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-2006-EMWIN-RFI
<RESPDATE>053106
<CONTACT>Paquetta Myrick-Hancock, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-3405, Fax 301-713-1024, Email Paquetta.N.Myrick-Hancock@noaa.gov
<DESC>This notice is a reissuance of the 2005-EMWIN-RFI notice posted on September 18, 2005.  Modifications 1 and 2 to the original notice were issued on October 17, 2005 and November 21, 2005, respectively, to extend the response period.  The notice is now being reissued because the response period to the original posting with subsequent modifications has expired and we wish to continue to receive information from interested parties.  The notice is as follows:

PURPOSE - This RFI is being issued to identify potential sources and products capable of enabling the public to receive and utilize NWS essential weather information.  It will allow the NWS to determine the interest of prospective manufacturers in designing, constructing and marketing systems for the reception of the Emergency Managers Weather Information Notification System(EMWIN) datastream or for software to make that information more valuable to EMWIN users.  The EMWIN satellite broadcast in its present form through the NOAA Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellites (GOES) must undergo a change when the new generation of satellites is placed into service sometime on or before 2011.  Existing EMWIN receiving systems must be adapted or replaced to make the transition to the new satellite broadcast.  The NWS wishes to identify and inform a community of potential offerors who have an interest in marketing low cost and reliable products capable of accommodating the transition.

BACKGROUND - What is EMWIN? The EMWIN system is a popular dissemination system providing a serial bit stream containing timely watches, warnings, forecasts, hydro-meteorological products, graphics and satellite imagery. The EMWIN data stream is prioritized to meet the needs of emergency managers. EMWIN uses the NOAA GOES satellites and economical receive systems to disseminate and process this bit stream. L-band Satellite broadcast is accomplished via GOES-East and GOES-West and also rebroadcast in Pacific via PeaceSat.  In addition to L-band satellite broadcast, portions of the EMWIN data stream are also rebroadcast via VHF radio, in certain areas, and via the internet in it's entirety via internet push technology.  Additional information may be found at:       http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.
EMWIN Satellite Broadcast - The current EMWIN broadcast modulation is Dual Frequency Shift Keying (DFSK) at a user data rate of 9.6 kbps.  The service is transmitted from the GOES satellites using an L-band down-link frequency at 1690.725 MHz.   Additional information may be found at the following address:     http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/WINSAT.HTM

What must change? - Changes in the next series of GOES satellites, the GOES-N thru P constellation, have necessitated development of a service to be offered as a replacement and upgrade to the existing broadcast.  All current EMWIN users will need to migrate to newer technologies due to frequency, power and modulation changes.  In addition, EMWIN users and contractors have also stressed the importance of increasing the EMWIN data rate and keeping the cost of the GOES-N transition as low as possible.

PREPARATION FOR TRANSITION - EMWIN System Design & specifications - Working with NESDIS, the NWS has developed a system design and specifications for the use of potential offerors.  The next generation broadcast, EMWIN-N is a digital direct broadcast service with a frequency of 1692.7MHz.  The broadcast will be offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation and convolutional rate 1/2 plus Reed Solomon forward error correction for additional gain.  The user data rate will be 19.2 kbps.  Details of the design and specification are now available at the following link:     http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc. 

Proof-of-Concept Development - To demonstrate the feasibility of a receiving system capable of meeting the new EMWIN system design, NESDIS has developed and constructed a proof-of-concept model system using hardware implementation for the intermediate-frequency (IF) conversion and a software-defined radio scheme for the demodulation.  Detailed information on the proof-of-concept design may be found within the specification at: http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  It is the intent of NWS to make the Demodulation and Decoding software and the dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that were developed available to the public at no charge.  The software may be downloaded at: http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/EMWIN-N%20OQPSK%20software.htm.   Potential offerors are free to develop any alternative scheme which meets the system design and specification criteria.
Launch of GOES-N Satellite - The proof-of-concept model has been successfully bench-tested and further tests will be conducted after the launch of the GOES-N satellite on or about early September, 2005.  The results of these tests will be posted, when available, at:     
http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWINtstReptGOES-N.doc.  After completion of these tests, the GOES-N satellite will be placed in storage until required to replace the generation of GOES satellites still in service.  These older satellites will be replaced by the new generation on or before 2011, depending upon fuel consumption, premature failure or demand for capabilities only present in the new satellites.     Before being placed into operational service, the GOES-N satellite will be activated each year for a test period.

INVITATION - Potential offerors who may have an interest in exploring possible development of EMWIN products compatible with the new generation of GOES satellites are encouraged to send an e-mail expressing their interest and any questions to emwin.system@noaa.gov.  No telephone calls please!
These e-mails will be used to develop a mailing list to be used by the NWS in disseminating additional information on EMWIN and the GOES satellite evolution and as part of a list of those invited to participate in an EMWIN conference to be held in Silver Spring, MD.
     
E-mail responses should include the following information:

1) Brief description of firm and current similar product lines;
2) Firm's URL;
3) Any questions; and
4) An expression of interest in being on the mailing list and possible participation in a forthcoming conference in Silver Spring, MD.

Interested parties who market EMWIN related products will be identified on a list of potentital offerors posted on the EMWIN website but without any endorsement by NWS.       

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES - Additional information on the EMWIN program and transition may be found on the EMWIN website located at the following address:

http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.

DISCLAIMER - This RFI is issued by NWS solely for obtaining information for planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Proprietary information must not be submitted and will not be accepted by NWS.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Interested parties are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.     Furthermore, no basis for claims against NWS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or NWS's use of such information.

AIR UNIVERSITY’S SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES
STATEMENT OF NEED


I.  OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this Statement of Need (SON) is to describe, for preliminary planning purposes only, the requirements of Air University (AU) that have been ear-marked for a Commercial Activity (OMB A-76 Study).  This SON captures in general terms the software development support activities for all existing, planned, and future AU enterprise-level automated information systems (AIS).  Typical software technical services and engineering support include capturing user and stakeholder requirements; coordinating with the appropriate AU agency personnel and performing tasks associated with enterprise architecture; capital investment planning; program/project management, identifying functional security, performance requirements, developing logical and physical database models; performing coding, testing, quality assurance, backup/recovery, design, program and system documentation, software maintenance, implementation; and maintaining interoperability between existing and future hardware and software applications.  Software applications include, but are not limited to client-server applications, web applications, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) integration, Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) integration, and custom applications development.  
     Software services not only support the Headquarters AU Directorates, but support is also provided to several AIS in the various AU colleges/schools.  These include, but are not limited to the following.  Air War College educates senior level officers (256 in-resident and 3,500 distant learners) to lead at the strategic level in the development and employment of air and space forces in support of National Security.  Air Command and Staff College is the Air Force’s intermediate professional military education school that prepares field grade officers (over 600 resident and 9,000 distance learners and seminar students) of all services, international officers, and U.S. civilians to assume positions of higher responsibility within the military and other government agencies.  The Squadron Officer College consists of the Air and Space Basic Course for 2nd Lieutenants and Squadron Officers School for Captains combined under one college.  Together these two schools prepare young officers for challenges of the future and develop leaders of tomorrow who will support the expeditionary culture.  The Ira C. Eaker College for Professional Development (CPD) provides professional continuing education and technical training to Air Force, International, and other DoD personnel.  CPD has eight component schools that offer 83 resident and distance learning courses to over 9,000 students annually.  The Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS) provide leadership and policy direction for the Air Force’s officer recruiting, training and commissioning programs at Officer Training School and at Air Force ROTC detachments at 144 universities.  About 80 percent of the new officers who enter the Air Force each year come through one of these programs.  AFOATS also directs the Air Force’s high school citizenship training program – Air Force Junior ROTC at more than 744 Air Force ROTC units on high school campuses around the world.  The Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) offers and awards job-related associate in applied science degrees that support the career transition of Air Force enlisted members.  Over 161,000 students completed about 1.7 million semester hours of course credit through CCAF affiliated schools in 2001-2002.  In the October 2004 graduating class, over 7,000 associate in applied science degrees were awarded.  Since its inception in 1993, the College for Enlisted Professional Military Education (CEPME) has refining, adapting, and deploying PME curriculum for enlisted education in the Air Force.  The Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning provides distance learning methodologies and technologies to support instructionally sound learning throughout the service.  This is accomplished through the Extension Course Program, the Air Technology
Network and ADL consulting services

All interested vendors will be required to have personnel possessing TOP SECRET security clearances and will be required to maintain offices in the immediat e vicinity of the NGIC in Charlottesville, Virginia. The NGIC is seeking a tightly integrated set of text exploitation capabilities. Single point solutions to individual requirements that require future integration will be looked upon less favorably than 'packaged and fully supported' solutions.    The ideal text exploitation tool suite shall be capable of & "	Scaling to support DoDIIS Enterprise operations at multiple Regional Service Centers (RSCs).  Several thousand simultaneous users are envisioned. "	Operating on DoDIIS accredited operating systems; Solaris 9/10 and/or Windows 2003.

"	Exporting data to multiple intelligence applications and in a multitude of formats; Intelligence Community Markup Language (ICML), CSV, PDF, ASCII text, etc. "	Ingesting real time message traffic feeds. "	Machine foreign language translation during data loading (Arabic & Chinese). "	Distributed or federated queries across structured and unstructured data repositories. "	Supporting multiple COTS/Open source text engines; i.e., Verity, Convera, Lucene, et. Al. "	Supporting foreign language queries. "	Providing Query by Example (QBE) or Natural Language Query (NLQ) interfaces. "	Searching through millions of records and returning ranked results in less than 30 seconds. The ideal text exploitation tool suite shall also provide & "	Query building tools; thesauri, alias lists, spell checkers, soundex capabilities. "	Support for nested proximity queries. "	Entity extractions (people, places, things, geocoordinates, nomenclatures et. Al.) "	Analysts with alerts & notifications of new incoming data. "	Categorization, clustering and filtering of result sets. "	Point-n-Click or filtered navigation of the results set.  "	Geospatial visualization and plotting of geographic coordinates on COTS/GOTS/Open Source mapping packages, e.g., ESRI product line, FalconView, OpenMap, etc. The ideal text exploitation tool suites technical architecture shall be & "	Written in Java and compliant with JRE 1.5.x. "	Compatible with IE 6.x, Netscape 7.x and Mozilla browsers "	Capable of ingesting taxonomies and ontologies. "	Compatible with Semantic Markup Technologies, specifically OWL, and will be capable of exploiting RDF triple stores.  "	Compliant with DISAs Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) and major components/tools shall be accessible as web services via published WSDLs. The NGIC fully realizes that all requirements may not be satisfied by a single software suite or vendor.  Therefore, capability statements should clearly indicate which requirements can be fully satisfied, partially satisfied or are not addressed at all. Individual vendors and vendor teams should clearly indicate whether their capabilities are based on open source software, GOTS, or proprietary software requiring licensing.  Licensing schemas, i.e., per cpu, per named user, per server enclave, per site, pe r network, et. Al. should also be indicated.  Technology vendors not serving in a system integration capacity should clearly indicate their preferred prime integrators. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.  Capability statements may be e-mailed to Mr. Harry Messimer a t harry.messimer@us.army.mil.  Technical questions may be addressed to Mr. Harry Messimer, harry.messimer@us.army.mil.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This is a sources sought/market survey announcement to seek industry sources for this requirement.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT MARKET SURVEY seeking to identify potential suppliers, and it is for planning and informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal, nor is it an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation; therefore, a SOLICIT ATION DOCUMENT DOES NOT EXIST AND WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The following Request for Information (RFI) for this Sources Sought Market Survey is issued for purposes of conducting market research and encouraging companies to provide information in regard to their  product. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey, or any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. The Program Manager's Office, Light Armored Vehicles (PMO-LAV), located at the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM)- Warren, is formulating acquisition and life cycle support strategies for a Variable Function Insert ( VFI) R un Flat Compressor Tool (RFCT). The Run Flat Compressor Tool will be used to compress the Hutchinson VFI Run Flat Part # VF0025 for installation into the Michelin XML Tire Part # TR0015. The RFCT must be able to withstand high volume usage (min 20 tires pe r day) under extreme adverse and field conditions. The RFCT must have an expected life of no less than 7300 cycles. It must be one-man portable and operated either by hand, or pneumatic operations. If pneumatic operations are involved, the RFCT must be cap able of being integrated into the current pneumatics of the LAV (Recovery variant). PMO-LAV is seeking candidate systems which do not require additional tools. The RFCT should not adversely affect the safety of the operator or incur damage to the tire asse mbly. Operation of the compressor tool should be able to be accomplished by the operator or 2nd echelon maintenance facility.

<SUBJECT>88 -- Yearling Steers for Research
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory, Mandan, North Dakota, intends to enter into a single source contract with Hettinger Research Extention Center, Hettinger, North Dakota, a division of North Dakota State University, for the purchase of 60 head of yearling steers for a research project consisting of spring forage-finishing trials which will begin February 2006.  The cattle must be from North or South Dakota or eastern Montana so they represent the typical cattle that are raised in this region of the Great Plains.  The cattle must be calm because they will be kept in small pastures delineated by single wire electric fencing and they will be moved frequently by people on foot or 4-wheelers.  The cattle must be accustomed to being fed from feed bunks.  The following cattle are required at stated weight and specific breeds in order for scientists to compare the weight gain on these particular breeds while grazing.  The cattle required are as follows:  Sixty (60) each Angus and/or Angus/Hereford crossbred yearling steers weighing approximately 700 pounds each.  The industry standard for purchasing livestock is from a livestock auction or directly from individual ranchers, with payment required by check or cash on the date of sale.  The USDA-ARS does not have the capability to be able to purchase this amount of livestock in this manner.  Attendance at more than one auction or dealing with more than one rancher may be necessary to purchase the number and type of cattle required and price comparison with the current market reports will be required to determine price reasonableness prior to purchase.  Hettinger Research Extention Center has the capability of determining what animals are suitable for different types of research, purchasing animals, as well as doing research.  *Provide Qualification Statement by Close of Business February 14, 2006, if interested in this procurement.

<SUBJECT>R -- Transition of program from SUNY to appropriate institutional setting
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate using simplified acquisition procedures with the Research Foundation of State University of New York (SUNY) for technical support and assistance services in the transition process and completion of their current research from SUNY to an appropriate institutional setting that is more capable of meeting data and Quality Assurance (QA) reporting requirements.  SUNY has been the location of the Quality Assurance/Science Activity Center and World Data Center for precipitation chemistry for over a decade.  All of the present World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch precipitation chemistry data reside at SUNY.  Assistance from SUNY is necessary to transition the program to a different laboratory.  It is expected that this process will take approximately seven months to complete.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is on file.

STATEMENT OF WORK – BACKGROUND - The Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), USDA, ARS and the Forest Service (FS) requires services to docket, track, and report quarterly on the status of foreign patents including the payment of annuities, taxes and maintenance fees to maintain existing patents in force.  Currently, there are approximately 800 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Applications/International Patents for which annuities, taxes, and maintenance fees may become due and payable.  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) sponsors research on new and useful products and processes which have potential application in the private and public sectors, and may seek patent rights in various foreign countries covering products and processes derived from the ARS Research.  ARS is the major research agency of the USDA and receives over 80 percent of the total patents.  USDA has the authority, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 207 and 15 U.S.C. 3710, to obtain and maintain patents in the United States and foreign countries.  USDA can grant licenses in accordance with the regulations set forth in 37 C.F.R. Chapter IV, as amended, to receive fees, royalties or other revenues therefrom, and to take all other suitable and necessary steps to protect and administer such rights.
ARS has a history of research collaborations with industry and academia.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, ARS has implemented a technology transfer program covering a variety of agricultural technologies that have high commercial potential to industry.  Patent applications possessing licensable beneficial foreign rights are being filed and prosecuted in foreign countries.  To serve public interest, the Government will ensure that the results of Federally-sponsored research be protected, marketed, and practiced so that maximum benefit is achieved in the form of enhanced U.S. economic activity and competitiveness.  The countries chosen for patent protection may include both member and non-member countries of the PCT.  
ARS researchers currently report over 100 inventions annually.  During Fiscal Year 2004, 150 inventions were reported, 63 were filed for domestic patents and 59 patents were issued.  During the same period, 24 PCT applications were filed.  The Department has a total current patent portfolio of 2034, for which there are approximately 800 foreign filings corresponding to 99 different U.S. filings.  The above information is for historical purposes only and comprises typical annual activity count for ARS.  ARS currently contracts with the law firm of Pendorf & Cutliff for filing and prosecuting all international applications for which ARS is responsible.  FS cases are included in this contract.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - The Contractor shall provide docketing, tracking, payment and reporting services for non-domestic patents.

receipt of the Tax Maintenance Report, the COR will authorize the Contractor to purchase the 
annuities, taxes and maintenance fees or to discontinue their payment, as appropriate.  The 
contractor shall provide the following documentation to the COR:(i)Monthly annuity 
confirmation of payments made.  (ii)  Receipts from each patent office as the Contractor receives
 them.  The Contractor agrees that all information disclosed by the Government to the Contractor 
in connection with this requirement shall be confidential and that all such information and all data 
on the media in which it is stored shall be the exclusive property of the Government.  The 
Contractor shall not disclose, either during the term of this contract or thereafter, any information

U. S. COAST GUARD HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

1.0	BACKGROUND:

The US Coast Guard (USCG) operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Currently these aircraft are being externally stripped and painted at the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM).  These aircraft have recently been experiencing paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the Coast Guard intends to have one of its HU-25 aircraft commercially painted, for field evaluation.  This RFQ establishes the minimum external paint requirements for this aircraft.
.  

2.0	OBJECTIVE:
            
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center with an onsite paint facility to prepare and externally paint one HU-25 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) commercial practices and the paint manufacturer’s recommended procedures.  Dassault Falcon Jet, Plaisir, France is the OEM.  The general scope of work is as follows:               
            
2.1	Pre-paint surface preparation IAW commercial specifications.  Contractor to identify  
       specifications in the quote.

Note:  Some areas of the aircraft are covered after assembly of the aircraft.  These areas were painted during the interim paint phase of the PDM evolution and will require scuff sanding and feathering so the contractor applied coatings will blend in with USCG coatings previously applied during interim paint as required.  Examples: Flight control surface leading edges, horizontal/vertical stabilizer attachment points, box structures and cavities.

2.2	Prime, paint and stencil the aircraft’s exterior surfaces IAW ARSC drawing 925-139, using Stencil/Decal Kit 925-139-1 and the paint manufactures recommended procedures.

2.3	Apply leading edge tape and radome boot IAW ARSC Drawing 925-139.

3.1.4	Adhere and conduct business in compliance with all Federal, State and Local Laws governing this type of work.

3.1.5	 The contractor shall dispose of all waste materials generated.

3.1.8	Provide access to perform a pre-award site visit and inspection of the actual facility (Subcontractor’s facility if applicable) the work is to be performed.
3.1.9	Perform an incoming inspection of the aircraft.

            described in their work proposal.

            Note: The USCG currently performs a thorough solvent and alkaline detergent  
            cleaning, deoxidization with an approved acid brightener, and the application of

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  

52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan 2006)
 
52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

•	         The Coast Guard may determine the best value which merits a higher price based on  
                     technical superiority.  The Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the  
                     selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as 
                     measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 – Technical
                       Factor 2 – Past Performance
                       Factor 3 – Cost/Price

	         Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While
               the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price 
               Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

               Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
               factors approach equal.

               Enclosure: (1) Detailed Factors
Enclosure (1)


DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical/Management Approach

The technical will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Vendor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Painting.  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Vendor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical approach includes:
 
(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical quote that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

&#61607;	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing these services.
&#61607;	Clear lines of communication between the Vendor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.

(d)	The Vendor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO  
        9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service  
        bulletins, and FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document..
.


Factor 2:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Vendor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard reserves the right to investigate other sources of past performance other than those submitted by the contractor.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Vendor’s actual performance on painting of similar or like aircraft.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.  To include experience is applying High Solid VOC compliant paints to high speed aircraft.

Contractor’s customer ratings including quality ratings, customer service, warranty, recommendation for future service and performance of coating during the aircraft’s operational period (e.g. gloss, adhesion, and paint defects).

               
Factor 3:  Cost/Price

Each Vendor’s cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation or proposed cost/price.  Vendor’s quote shall be a firm-fixed-price.  USCG cost evaluation will be based considering two criteria: 1) Vendor’s quote; 2) USCG travel cost and roundtrip aircraft ferry cost from Elizabeth city, NC.  There is no intent to sacrifice quality for schedule.    

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN in the Offeror’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Offeror’s technical proposal.  The price quote should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #6009. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08 dated 1/5/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing 15(fifteen) genomes will assist towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to construct a custom chip from the manufacturer that shall contain a diverse array of bacterial pathogens. This chip shall be unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind shall exist. The contractor shall provide to RML services  to produce a custom bacterial pathogen gene chip. This is a 6 to 8(six-eight) week, one time work effort, where the final product shall be a custom gene chip containing oligo pairs at high density, specific to 15(fifteen) bacterial pathogen genomes.  These chips shall be compatible with the Affymetrix fluidics and hybridization station and scanner. The contractor shall keep all RML derived data secure and shall not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers shall be secure and in compliance with RML IT security procedures and policies.  The RML will provide support access to Technical support from Affymetrix regarding the RML custom chip if needed.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES:  Step 1: The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip shall be high density,  at 106 per cm2 or greater (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® shall be made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1(one) mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array shall be based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and shall be able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array shall be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on our Affymetrix system, which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place here at RML.  Deliverables: 135(one-hundred thirty-five) chips shall be delivered to RML 2(two) months from award of the purchase order to the contractor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This is a Request For Proposals (RFP).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation (RFP 06-3K06-007) is hereby issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  A sources sought was posted for this requirement under number 05-3K06-083 and is replaced with RFP 06-3K06-007.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08.  This solicitation is being issued as full and open competition.  The applicable NAICS code is 541110 and size standard for this requirement is $6 Million.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. Amendment 2 includes:  Evaluation Procedures, Reps and Certs, Clauses and other contract  terms and conditions. 
52.212-2  EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999).  As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:  Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1)  Evaluation Criteria:  The Government will evaluate the degree to which the proposal demonstrates the Offeror's ability to thoroughly and efficiently meet the requirements set forth in Attachment I, Statement of Work, and the degree to which the proposal demonstrates the Offeror's understanding of the Government's needs.  a. FACTOR 1-Technical Approach - An established computerized docketing, tracking, and payment system is a requirement.  Offerors must have the ability to implement and execute a computerized docketing, tracking, and payment system with the capabilities to calculate and administer different country-by-country patent regulations in regards to the payment of annuities, taxes, and maintenance fees. This also includes knowledge of and the ability to comply with applicable laws and legal authorities of the country in which the taxes, annuity payment or work is being performed. Safeguards in place to verify data accuracy and ensure no annuities are missed are a requirement.  50 Points.  b. FACTOR 2-Past Performance - This information will be used to determine risk to performance.  Offerors who already perform services in docketing, tracking and payment of annuities will be given preference.  50 Points.  c. FACTOR 3-Price - Will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism.  While price will not be point scored, it is important and will be considered in the award decision. (1)Reasonableness: Competition will be used to determine price reasonableness.  If adequate price competition does not exist, reasonableness will be evaluated by assessing the acceptability of the offeror’s methodology used in developing the price.  (2) Price Realism.  The Government will perform a price realism analysis to determine if the prices in an offerors proposal are (a) realistic for the work to be performed; (b) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and (c) are consistent with the various elements of  the offeror’s technical proposal.  Any significant inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance, and price, if unexplained, raises a fundamental issue of the offeror’s understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and financial ability/responsibility to perform the contract.  TOTAL POINTS: 100.  (2)  RISK ASSESSMENT: An overall assessment of risk will be made for all factors combined, and the price to perform the requirements of the resultant contract.  An assessment of risk will be made as provide the following information:
Name, address, email address, fax and telephone number of the contracting organization, the Project Officer, and the Contracting Officer, contract number, type, and dollar value, date of contract and period of performance,  brief description of contract work, scope, and responsibilities, discuss the similarities and differences between the proposed effort and that contract, discuss any special problems encountered during the performance of services under the contracts, average number of technical personnel involved (by labor skill), percentage turnover of contract technical personnel/year, identify any contract similar to the proposed requirement which was terminated for convenience or default within the past five years.  include the contract number, name, address, email address, fax and telephone number of the terminating Contracting Officer.	      
f.  Include financial statements for the last two years so that financial risk can be 
    evaluated.

I.	INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements listed in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Performancence-based Statement of Work  (SOW) entitled “Annuity Patent Tracking and Docketing Services” at the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) located in the George Washington Carver in Beltsville, Maryland.  This performance-based plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the OTT will use in monitoring the contractor’s compliance with the Statement of Work technical performance.  

II.	PURPOSE

1.1.1.	The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to measure performance, identify the reports required and the government roles and responsibilities.  The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards set forth in the SOW.  The results of the evaluation, reflected in the reports generated by implementing the QASP, become the basis for determining the service provider’s revised compensation.


III.	        PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:

The Government will communicate performance objectives expected from the contractor throughout the SOW.  For each performance objective communicated in the SOW, the Government has identified critical performance evaluation elements.  These elements are described  below in the QASP Table.
The contractor’s Quality Control Plan (QCP) shall set forth the procedures for self inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements listed in the PRS.  The contractor will develop and implement a simplified performance management system with processes to assess and report their performance to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).


IV.	        METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE:

This QASP will define the approach taken by the OTT to monitor, manage, and take appropriate action on the service provider performance against expected outcomes or performance objectives and standards communicated in the SOW.  In an effort to minimize the contract administration burden upon the Government, simplified methods of surveillance and reliance on simplified techniques shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance.  The primary methods of surveillance are reviews of monthly reports, receipts, foreign associate/attorney correspondence, and review of those records and files that are required to be maintained and delivered under this SOW.  These documents will be used to assist in determining if the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is being maintained.   

V.	ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING RESULTS

The Contracting Officer’s Representative will work with the contractor in a collaborative manner to make decisions and take action based on performance evaluation information to ensure:

A.	Corrective actions are being taken

B.	Customer expectations are being met

C.	The Contractor is presented with a look ahead to achieve proactive management including being alerted on upcoming events based on customer developments.

Failure to perform may result in deductions to the contractor’s monthly invoice or termination of the contract.

A.	Notifications: Consistent with FAR Part 49, the Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor of failure to meet standards.

B.	Deductions: The Government has the right to withhold a portion of payment for the monthly cost of performing particular services based on failure to meet performance standards.

C.	Termination: If the Contracting Officer determines that the contractor has failed to perform to the extent that a termination for default is justified, the Contract Officer shall issue a notice of termination, consistent with FAR Part 49.















VI.	QASP Performance Requirement Summary Table:

SOW Section	Requirement	AQL	Measure	Surveillance Method	Deduction
					
C.3	Timely Payment of Annuities:   The COR will evaluate the monthly annuity confirmation payment reports against invoices from the Contractor each month, to ensure all annuities were paid at least thirty (30) days prior to the deadline by contractor. 
	100%	Accuracy/ Completeness	Monthly review of reporting documentation and receipts.  	In the event that patent annuities are not paid before the official deadline and it is determined the contractor is at fault, and a surcharge is assessed, the Contractor will assume the cost of the resulting fee(s).  If the fault is determined to lie with the Government, the Government will assume the cost of the resulting fee(s).

					
C.3.1	Loss of Patent Rights:  Upon being notified, either by the Contractor, Foreign Associate, or Individual Country Patent Office, that patent rights were lost either retrievably or irretrievably due to non-payment of an annuity, the COR will investigate the file and use other resources as necessary to determine the cause of such a loss.  The COR will investigate to determine if instruction was made by the Government and all requested information was furnished.  Extenuating circumstances will also be reviewed before making a determination regarding responsibility for such a loss.	100%	Notification/accuracy and reliability of information	Review monthly reporting documentation,  receipts and  
Foreign Associate /
Attorney correspondence 	If patent rights are irretrievably lost and the fault is determine to lie with Contractor or Contractor’s associate, the Government will be reimbursed the annuity fee.  If rights are not irretrievably lost, but Petitions and other necessary documentation must be filed, the Contractor shall assume the cost of filing such petitions and documentation.  If the fault is determined to lie with the Government, the Government will assume such costs.
C.3.1	Timely Docketing, Tracking, and Reporting:  The Government will promptly furnish all the information as stipulated in the Statement of Work to facilitate docketing and will review all reports and receipts received from Contractor to determine if the Contractor is docketing and tracking annuities at least thirty (30) days prior to the official deadline for payment.  Confirmation that annuities have been paid must be received by the Government no later than thirty (30) days after the Official deadline for payment.	100%	Accuracy and reliability of information	Review monthly reporting documents, receipts and  
Foreign Associate /
Attorney correspondence 	If Contractor is not providing docketing and tracking services for annuities at least thirty (30) days prior to the official deadline for payment, and the Government has furnished the necessary information to facilitate such docketing and tracking services, a penalty may be assessed and a deduction of 25% may be taken from the invoice containing the annuities in question.  If the fault is determined to lie with the Government, no penalty will be assessed.   If confirmation that annuities have been paid is not received within thirty (30) days after the Official deadline for payment, the Government will deduct the total fee for the annuities in question from the invoice.
					

1.2	STRATEGY

1.2.1	The government will communicate performance objectives and standards expected from the service provider through the SOW.  These performance objectives are summarized in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) table of this QASP.  For each performance objective and standard communicated in the SOW, the government will identify corresponding performance standards that are required to be tracked and reported by the Contractor.  

1.2.2	The Government representative will monitor performance and review performance reports furnished by the Contractor on a regular interval basis to determine how the Contractor is performing against communicated performance objectives and standards.  The government will make decisions based on performance management data and notify the Contractor of those decisions.  The Contractor shall be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is effectively managed.


2.0	ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1.	The relationship between the Contractor and the government will be a partnership committed to the mutual success of each party.

2.2	As a minimum, the Principal Contracting Officer (CO) will designate a Contracting Officer’s Representatives (COR) as the government authority for performance management.    

2.3	The COR is responsible for developing insight into the specific service of annuity patent tracking and docketing services for foreign patents and will assist the Contractor with understanding the performance expectations as stated in the SOW.  The COR is specifically responsible for monitoring, assessing, and communicating the technical performance of the service provider.  The COR will have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms (refer to Attachments 1 and 2) used to document the inspection and evaluation of the Contractor’s performance.  Government surveillance may occur under the Inspection of Services clause for any service relating to the contract.


2.4	The COR is required to ensure changes in work are not initiated before a written authorization or a modification is issued by the CO.  The CO will be responsible for overall monitoring of contract compliance and issuing modifications thereto.  

3.0.	IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED

The service provider shall perform the specific BARC and USNA requirements listed in the SOW for the following service areas:

1.	Services to Pay Annuities (SOW Section C.3)
2.	Services to Work Cases (Docket and Track) (SOW Section C.3)
3.	Services to Provide Receipts and Reports, Tax Maintenance
	List, Confirmation Reports (SOW Section  C.3 and C.4)
4.	Annuity Payments and Taxes  (SOW Section  C.3)

4.0.	QUALITY ASSURANCE REPORTING AND ANALYSIS 

4.1	The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes.  Expectations of service levels are expressed in the PWS and measured by the required performance standards in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).  The Contractor will implement a QCP that sets forth procedures and responsibilities for ensuring quality work performance.  The Contractor will develop a performance management process to assess and report their performance to the COR, which will be submitted in a monthly Progress Report.  
4.2	The government’s QA monitoring, accomplished by the COR, will be reported using the monitoring forms in Attachments 1 and 2.  The forms, when completed, will document the COR’s understanding of the Contractor’s performance under the contract to ensure that the SOW requirements are being met.
4.2.1	In addition to QA monitoring, the COR will use the Quarterly Tax Maintenance Report, Confirmation List Report and the monthly Progress Report as well as customer complaints to assess the Contractor’s level of performance for each performance objective measured in this QASP.  The COR must coordinate and communicate with the service provider to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance.
4.2.2	The COR will retain a copy of all completed QA monitoring forms and forward copies to the CO and Contractor in a timely manner.  The Contractor is required to respond in writing to the COR regarding the QA monitoring forms recording performance that “does not meet standards” within 5 working days after receipt of the forms.
4.3	The COR will review Contractor responses to the issues identified in the QA monitoring form prepared by the COR.  By the 10th of each month, the Contractor shall compile a summary assessment of the Contractor’s performance for the previous month.  The Progress Report consists of an assessment of the Contractor’s monthly reports and when due the information from the quarterly reports as well as information on annuity payments.

d.  Ensure the online Offeror’s Representations and Certifications have been completed and 
     posted.
e. A list of references that can substantiate successful past performance for the same or similar work.  Attachment III is a list of sample questions that will be asked your references.   Please provide the following information regarding past performance:  Discuss your company’s experience which is similar to the Government’s requirements in (1) services to pay annuities and taxes; (2) services to docket and track cases; (3) services to provide receipts and reports, tax maintenance lists, and confirmation reports.  Discuss any special abilities of your company not covered above which relate to patent annuities.  Indicate the approximate percentage of your company’s activities that is directed to patent annuities.  Government experience is preferred and will receive additional consideration.
List five (5) contracts of a nature and complexity similar to the requirements above awarded or performed within the past 5 years.  For each contract listed, to the 
probability of meeting the requirement successfully, utilizing the offeror’s technical and price approach.  Risk will be assessed in terms of High, Medium and Low.
The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the Risk Assessment:
High –  Likely to cause serious disruption of schedule, successful monitoring of patent annuities or performance, price or degradation of quality of service even with special efforts during contract administration. 
	Medium – Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, successful monitoring of patent 
	annuities or performance, price, or degradation of quality of service, however special effort 
	during contract administration may be able to overcome difficulties.
	Low – Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, successful monitoring of patent 
	annuities or performance, price or degradation of quality.  Normal contract administration will 
	probably be able to overcome minor difficulties.

the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond by 5:45 p.m. Eastern time.
The financial institution shall be compensated by direct payment of fee.

The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations. The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm. They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow and unpaved roads that border on 3,000 to 5,000 foot drops. The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.


The vehicle offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations far from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer’s warranties. Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia’s extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain. The supplied vehicles are to be “new,” which is defined as “having zero miles.” Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.     Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government. The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.


2.0.       PRICING

Line Item No. 0001: Pickup Truck, Quantity: Up to 90, provide quotation showing unit price and total maximum price, including all features listed below, priced in U.S. dollars.


The above price is in terms of “Cost, Insurance and Freight” (CIF), with final delivery to be made at the Duty Free Zone at Customs in La Paz, Bolivia. The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in La Paz.  The Embassy will clear and title the vehicles.

4.0.       DESCRIPTION.


4.1. General:


The pickup truck required to support NAS operations is categorized as an off-highway vehicle (OHV). Deployment and use of the vehicles will be primarily on secondary roads and unimproved off-road conditions. The supported operations will include around-the-clock, all-weather use (in hot, temperate, and cold climates). The vehicles are expected to operate on primary roads, secondary roads, cross country terrain and trails, as well as in deteriorated urban environments.


These vehicles will play a significant role in moving personnel and equipment from NAS support sites to remote locations, across terrain that is inaccessible by most vehicles. The vehicles must be able to negotiate steep hills, valleys and man-made objects that are typical of the obstacles encountered in their various operating environments. The vehicle must provide sufficient traction, as well as adequate balance and safety (in terms of overturning and/or straining the power train). It is of the utmost importance that the vehicles provide a stable and safe platform for moving equipment and personnel into and out of operation areas. In addition to transporting equipment and personnel, the vehicles may be used by security personnel patrolling remote areas in a force protection role, and the vehicles must be capable of being deployed quickly in response to threats.
