<DESC>The United States Army Expeditionary Contracting Command - 410th Contracting Support Brigade (CSB) is planning to solicit and award a firm fixed-price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The MATOC will be for Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) and Disaster Preparedness (DP) Assessment, Logistics, and Training (ALT) Support Services and Supplies, heretofore referred to as HA/DP ALT, in the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) which includes, but is not limited to, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean for a 12-month base period and two 12-month options. The MATOC will be structured for maximum flexibility in providing for an expedited ordering process in order to satisfy the needs of USSOUTHCOM in the execution of its mission in its AOR. HA/DP ALT contractors will provide support in the following three task areas: <br><br>Task 1 - Assessment: Support the observation, examination, inspection, and analysis of the humanitarian assistance and disaster preparedness of various organizations, their plans, operations, and logistics. Appraise, evaluate and measure various organizations, their plans, operations, and logistics.  The surveillance and assessment will take an overarching approach at all levels and at all agencies, governmental, non-governmental and civil; <br><br>Task 2 - Logistics:  Support TO requirements with the provision of certain logistic items including but not limited to the following types of support - supply operations, field services, and other operations/services; and <br><br>Task 3 - Training:  Support USSOUTHCOM training responsibilities inherent to the HA/DP mission and operations requirements, and compliance with and performance of statutory, regulatory, and doctrine governing and pertaining to the HA/DP mission and operations. This includes all collective training; training readiness; training to established requirements and levels; the process, conduct of training operations and assurance of training to standards to meet HA/DP Operations; the development and execution of plans, programs and efficacy of HA/DP training; and the provisioning and supervision of training and training support to accommodate prescribed HA/DP objectives.  Training support may include risk/safety assessments as needed.  Training may include providing and installing equipment and providing logistics support at host nation training events.  Performance of work will be at various echelons, organizations using various formats including classroom, on-site, on-the-job, and distance learning.   <br><br>The applicable NAICS code is 541614, Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services; with a small business size standard of $14.0 million. This requirement will be solicited on a total small business set-aside basis.<br><br>The nations of Central and South America and the Caribbean have continually experienced a turbulent history of widespread natural disasters. Throughout the region, J4 USSOUTHCOM, in collaboration with local, national, regional, international, governmental and non-governmental organizations, is working to improve recipient nations' disaster response capabilities. This has been accomplished by increasing the capacity and regional infrastructure of recipient nations through support of established regional emergency management mechanisms. A coordinated effort between the U.S. Country Teams and USSOUTHCOM has improved the capacity of recipient nations to respond to humanitarian emergencies and reduce the need for U.S. military assistance. The J4 is responsible for tailoring community development actions in developing countries with a strong emphasis on regions and villages particularly susceptible to natural or man-made disasters. <br><br>HA/DP activities meet two key requirements: maintaining a robust overseas presence aimed at shaping the international security environment in a manner that deters would-be aggressors, strengthens friends and allies, and promoting peace and stability in regions of tension; and, when called upon, assist the victims of natural or manmade disasters. This segment of the program is also tailored to help partner nations, particularly those that have been affected by disaster or hardship, to improve healthcare, education and ensure sustainable community development. The ultimate goal is to build the capacity of community members in order to meet existing and future challenges and mitigate the need for U.S. assistance. <br><br>This solicitation will be issued on or about July 18, 2012 and available to be downloaded from the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.

<DESC>FEDBIZOPS  --  Special Notice The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, Columbia Cascades Area Office, Bend field Office (BFO) intends to negotiate one sole-source contract to control or manage noxious vegetation at Reclamation facilities within the Bend Field Office jurisdiction:  Rogue River Project (Agate, Emigrant, and Howard Prairie Lakes), Crooked River Project (Prineville Reservoir), and Deschutes Project (Wickiup, Crane Prairie and Haystack Reservoirs), through an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program.   One contract will be negotiated with Crook County, Oregon.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 926140, Agricultural pest & Weed Regulation, Govt., and the small business size standard is not applicable, Reclamation has determined under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, that the Crook County Weed Control possesses the unique qualifications for these services for Bureau of Reclamation lands in Oregon.  The unique source determination is based on the following: The nature of the required work is complex, continuous, and at a program management level.  Persons contracted for this work must understand Reclamation's mission and land management needs.  The Work involves considerably more than just spraying noxious weeds on Reclamation lands.  The supplies and services required by Reclamation through the BFO for operation of the IPM are: (1) technically uncommon and not widely available commercially (expertise in plant identification, herbicides, biological control agents, and the regulations which govern them, and state applicator certifications for field work);  (2) required to be implemented across a large geographic scale (across four counties spanning hundreds of miles and several very different physiographic provinces); (3) broad in scope (chemical, biological, and regulatory expertise) and require familiarity with the coordination needs and on-going efforts of county, state, and federal weed control personnel; (4) are not readily available from a private sector contractor.  To appeal to private sector contractors, the scope of work for Reclamation's IPM program would have to be significantly simplified, greatly reduced in geographic scope, and reduced in its expectation that Reclamation's IPM mission would be addressed.  The resulting contracts would be larger in overall number, smaller in dollar amounts, and more geographically and work specific.  Reclamation's IPM program extends significantly beyond weed spraying, and needs to be managed effectively within the larger context of the state and the region, and across local, state, and other federal jurisdictions.  To achieve consistency in IPM programs across all levels, a management partnership with state and county-level organizations is the most efficient alternative. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and award of this requirement will not be delayed to qualify a new contractor.  Firms believing they can provide the services listed above must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. All responses received within 15 days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Inquiries will be accepted by electronic mail to jmathews@usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address <br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine Office of Acquisitions, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Acquisitions Branch, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, II Democracy Plaza, Suite 700W/Rm. 770B,&nbsp;Bethesda, Maryland 20817.
<p>Description<br />National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, with Banner Health, 1441 N. 12th St., Phoenix, AZ 85006, 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic computed tomographic scans (18 FDG PET-CT), quantity = 16.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 423450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm-fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Our current protocols entitled Study of short-term metabolic adaptation: Prediction of weight change and effects of macronutrient manipulations and Predicting adaptive thermogenesis are investigating how energy expenditure changes with acute overfeeding and fasting and whether these changes predict weight gain in both inpatient and outpatient settings. These protocols also investigate mechanisms of changes in energy expenditure and involve the use of PET-CT scans to evaluate the presence of brown adipose tissue and its activation with cold and overfeeding. The contractor will perform fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomographic (CT) scans via the Banner Health PET center. Volunteers enrolled into the above study shall be transported to the Banner Health PET center by NIH employees. The volunteers will be transported either 1) wearing a cooling vest, 2) after fasting or 3) following a 24 hour period of overfeeding. In the case of when they wear the cooling vest, the volunteer will continue to wear the vest during the injection of the fluorodeoxyglucose until just before the scan is done. The contractor will agree to work with the NIH and its employees to assure that the PET/CT scans are done according to the described protocol. The images from the PET portion should be of the entire body. However, the CT scan will only be performed on the upper chest at the agreed upon landmarks. The vendor will provide a copy of each scan in a digital format within 15 days of each scan. Similar PET-CT scans at Banner PET center have previously been performed in accordance with the protocol entitled study of short-term metabolic adaptation: Prediction of weight change and effects of macronutrient manipulation and therefore, this contractor has the necessary expertise to perform these research scans. In addition, the expertise of the collaborators associated with the Banner PET center is crucial to both the performance and analyses of these scans. To the best of the Government's knowledge, there is no other facility that can provide the appropriate technical facilities and expertise from collaborators.</p>

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid. The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to notify potential offerors of the Navys requirement under RFP N40084-13-R-0002, for a Design-Build Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Construction Contract at US Navy Support Facility, Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).  The project will be solicited as an unrestricted procurement using the source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.101
and 15.3. The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit price and technical proposals. Evaluation of proposals will be based on price and technical evaluation factors, as stated in the solicitation, with contract award to be made to the offeror submitting the best value to the Government.
   The contract resulting from this solicitation will result in contract award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the most advantageous to the US Government, considering price and technical evaluation factors.  The work includes, but is not limited to, labor, supervision, tools, materials and equipment necessary to perform new construction, repair, and/or alteration of existing infrastructure.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a twelve month
Base Period and four twelve-month Option Periods, for a total maximum duration of sixty  months.  

The estimated dollar value, including the Base Period and Four Option Periods is $90,000,000.
  The minimum task order limitation will be established at $150,000, with an unspecified maximum task order amount. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of between $3,000,000 and $10,000,000 is guaranteed to be ordered under the performance period of the contract.  The minimum guarantee amount will be determined prior at the RFP release.  The minimum guarantee may be met by the issuance of a task order during the Base Period or Option Periods. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.
  There are no additional minimum guarantees obligated for each Option year.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with an annual size standard of $33.5M. At the time of proposal, interested parties must consist of a Joint-Venture effort between a United States firm (minimum 60%) and a United Kingdom firm (minimum 20%).  In any U.S. /U.K. joint ventures, management control will be vested in the U.S. partner or partners.

Anticipate a one-time pre-proposal conference and site visit on or about March, 2013 in Diego Garcia, which will be restricted to registered plan-holder firms only.  Due to the logistical constraints posed by the location, each firm will be allowed only three attendees on the site visit.
 

Each pre-proposal conference and site visit request must include the following information: full name, gender, citizenship, nationality, name of firm being represented, position/title, social security number, complete company and home address, passport number (place of issuance, date of issue, expiration date), and e-mail address(es).  

Due to the lead time required for visitors to receive area clearance to Diego Garcia, it is imperative that each firm provide the above information to the Contracting Officer within 5 business days from receipt of the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Failure to submit all required information by the date to be determined at the time of the issuance of the RFP will preclude the firms eligibility to participate in the site visit and pre-proposal conference.
 No additional names will be accepted after the registration deadline.  

It is the responsibility of the plan-holder to arrange for transportation to Singapore.  A Government-sponsored MAC (AMC) flight will be available to transport plan-holders from Paya Lebar, Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Base, Singapore, to Diego Garcia.  Contractors are responsible for the cost of the AMC flight which is approximately $2,500 roundtrip from Singapore to Diego Garcia.  At the time of the flight request to Diego Garcia, the contractor must also provide the contractor billing information in order for the U.S. Government to bill the contractor. 

It is highly recommended that flight arrangements to Singapore allow for significant flexibility in the event that the scheduled MAC flight becomes delayed or encounters unscheduled changes.

<a href="mailto:Lewis.Debbie@epa.gov">Lewis.Debbie@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Standard and Assessment Division, intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis, under the authority of FAR 6-302-1 with EERA, LLC  to fill a requirement for analysis of the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle rebound effect and those factors that may affect its magnitude. 
One of the main objectives of this project is to update the previous literature review and critical assessment.  A second major objective is to explore the potential analytical method, key variables and data availability related to the rebound effect for Heavy Duty Vehicles.  A third object is to use quantitative models/tools to estimate the rebound effect associated with new fuel economy standard or fuel consumption reductions related with Medium Duty/Heavy Duty vehicles in the U.S.
Programs and policies designed to increase the fuel efficiency of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles may overestimate the benefits associated with their programs because entities, for example, may choose to switch from one mode of transport (e.g., rail) to truck transport, given that the cost per mile of truck driving has been reduced compared to rail (i.e., intermodal shifting).  This analysis is needed to support the current regulatory work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the medium- and heavy-duty sector.   The Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transportation (GIFT) model is the only known model that allows for the modeling of intermodal freight transportation, which is an important component of the rebound effect.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm believing it capable of meeting EPA's requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the requirements.  Documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 calendar days of the posting of this notice.
A determination not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is  334516.   Please submit relevant documentation in writing to:  US EPA, ATTN:  Debbie Lewis, 26 W. Martin Luther King, Mail Stop: Norwood, Cincinnati, OH 45268, or email lewis.debbie@epa.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<a href="mailto:jonathan.j.current@usace.army.mil">USACE HEC, Ft. Belvoir</a>
<DESC>In 1951, Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) tasked the Office of the Chief of Engineers to develop a system to facilitate contingency construction planning and to serve as a guide to engineer field units in the Joint Operations Area (JOA). Later that year, the Engineer Functional Component System (EFCS) was developed which consisted of a set of standard facility designs that included bill of materials (BOM), planning data, and blueprint drawings.  This system was managed and supported at HQDA and remained the system until the early 1960's when it was renamed the Army Facilities Components System (AFCS). AFCS continued to be a manual system until the early 1970's when the information was entered into a mainframe computer in Washington DC with the drawings remaining in hard copy form. The BOM, planning data, and drawings were compiled into technical manuals. <br>  <br> With the need to access AFCS data by other organizations, the first automated version of AFCS was created in 1985. The Theater Army Construction Automated Planning System (TACAPS) was developed to provide a method for using current AFCS design and logistics master files in a remote location. TACAPS provided an automated method of identifying, maintaining, and disseminating information for construction planning in a Joint Operational Area (JOA) or for contingency situations. The automation of AFCS continued in 1990 with Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (CERL) being tasked to develop a version of AFCS that would run on a desktop computer. <br>  <br> Currently the Army is leading the effort to transition the Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) and the Theater Construction Management System (TCMS) into the Joint Construction Management System (JCMS). The transition to the JCMS will occur in May of 2013 per the 2012 Joint Engineer Work Plan for the Joint Chiefs of Staff J4 Engineer Division.  Engineer experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan have again highlighted the need to standardize contingency basing standards and designs across the Joint Engineer Community.  The use of multiple standards and designs for similar facilities creates inefficiencies in the use of resources and creates challenges for turning facilities over for contracted operations and maintenance.  Inconsistently applied master planning principles also led to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in our contingency bases.  Future operations will require each Service's Engineers to work together to meet all of the Engineer requirements.  The JCMS will provide a single system that all Services can use to plan and execute construction in support of the Joint Force Commanders.   <br>  <br> The transition from AFCS to JCMS includes the following major efforts: <br>  <br>  	Development of metric designs and a complete review and update to both existing AFCS designs and designs from Sister Services to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) for Non-Permanent Facilities in Support of Military Operations prior to integration into the JCMS database.   <br>  	Significant software programming upgrades to improve the functionality of the TCMS software, and to ensure interoperability with existing commercial construction management and design software and Service specific logistical systems to streamline bill of material acquisition.   <br>  	Validation and approval that the AFCS software and data servers are fully compliant with DoD Information Assurance policies and regulations in order to migrate into the NETCOM domain. <br>  	Working with DLA and AMC to catalog metric construction materials and to develop the process by which the AFCS/JCMS material data is updated to reflect changes made within the Federal Logistics Database <br>  <br> The Office of the Chief of Engineers and the AFCS Program Manager require Contractor technical instruction support in order to educate the Department of Defense on aspects of the AFCS Program and to deliver a functional Joint Construction Management System set of instruction to the Joint Engineer Community.  The Contractor shall provide project management, labor, materials, supplies, transportation and all things necessary to provide technical instruction support, Program of Instruction (POI) Development and analytical services for JCMS transition.   <br>  <br> The Contractor Instruction Development Team (IDT) shall be required to provide support in the completion of training doctrine analysis, identification of stake holders, development of  training objectives, identification of appropriate requirements pursuant to delivery of  AFCS/JCMS training; develop AFCS/JCMS training modules; conduct instruction support; and execute technical assessments of AFCS/JCMS training for the AFCS to JCMS transition.  Work will be accomplished at the AFCS Facility, contractor facility or off site location.  <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2, this procurement will utilize full and open competition after exclusion of sources.  Specifically, this procurement will be 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns in accordance with FAR 6.206, which allows Contracting Officers to set-aside solicitations to fulfill the statutory requirements relating to the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f).  The associated NAICS code is 541611 for Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services and the size standard is $14.0 Million.  Only proposals submitted by qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns will be accepted by the Government.  Any proposal submitted by a contractor that is not a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concern will not be considered for award. <br>  <br> The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Contract for a period of one (1) year with two(2) one(1) year options. The contracting office will not be notifying offeror's when the solicitation is released. It is the Offeror's responsibility to watch FedBizOpps for the solicitation. Anticipated release date of the RFP will be on or about 7 December 2012. A proposal will be due 30 days from the release date unless an amendment is issued to extend.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

a.	The Contractor gaining award shall provide all  personnel, management, supplies, transportation, equipment and supervision necessary to perform and complete all work to construct a Marker Grid Support System that includes, but not limited to:  clearing and grubbing vegetation, excavation and backfill, marker identification tagging, existing concrete demolition and disposal, marker handling, concrete foundation, concrete pre-cast marker support block, marker re-installation with leveling sand, marker cleaning, turf and restoration work.  The awarded contractor shall cover a period from date of award through 365 days from date of award.  Performance shall be in accordance with the requirements, conditions, terms and representations contained in this solicitation. 

b.	One of the most important considerations in erecting or emplacing a headstone or marker is that of precision in alignment.  Much of the beauty that exists or should exist in a national cemetery is the direct result of perfectly aligned headstones and markers.  It only takes one headstone or marker out of alignment to spoil the appearance of an entire row, and thereby, the appearance of the entire section.  The appearance of the finished work shall be gravesite section(s) that shall be contoured grass landscape, with headstones set in a concrete footing system and the headstones aligned with each other in the vertical, horizontal, lateral and diagonal directions within the tolerances specified herein.  It is critical that existing conditions are surveyed and contours adjusted as necessary and approved by the COR to produce such an appearance.  Failure to achieve this finished work will be basis for accepting or not accepting the finished work.

c.	All work to complete a single gravesite and the immediate surrounding turf in accordance with the drawings and specifications.  Immediate surrounding turf is that turf that begins at the gravesite and runs up to the adjoining gravesites, section boundaries, fences, curbs, sidewalks, garden or tree lines and as further defined on the drawings.  Awards will be made based on entire "Row or "Rows" of gravesites and may contain Government Upright Headstones and Private Headstones or Flat Markers as defined herein.  A single "Row" of gravesites is defined as an array of continuous gravesites that begins and ends at the limits of a single section.  The number of actual gravesites in each row may and does vary.

<DESC>
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) and the Office of Information and Technology (OIT), intend to enter into a firm-fixed price contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for hoteling seats and services in the Eatontown, New Jersey (NJ) area to Metro Offices, 11710 Plaza America Drive, Reston, Virginia 20190.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  Metro Offices is the only source that has the required amount of hoteling seats and services in the Eatontown, NJ area and in the time required.  The period of performance will be an eighteen month base period and two six-month option periods.  Commercial acquisition procedures will be utilized in accordance with FAR Part 12.
 "Hoteling" type office services or business center arrangements are commonplace in the commercial market. Office space, all ancillary services (reception, mail delivery), and furnishings are provided so that companies can perform normal work functions.  This type of arrangement is found in large cities where off site "virtual offices" are often required for such tasks as attorney document review, litigation, proposal preparation and so forth.   Such contracts do not involve lease or tenancy rights normally found in standard commercial lease terms and conditions.  Typically, hoteling contracts state "This agreement is the commercial equivalent of an agreement for accommodation(s) in a hotel. The whole of the Center remains in possession and control. The client accepts that this agreement creates no tenancy interest, leasehold estate, or other real property interest in the clients favor with respect to the accommodations.   The client is being provided the right to share the use of the center"
The TAC currently has a task order for hoteling type office space and services with Metro Offices at their 3 Christopher Way location in Eatontown, NJ.  The task order was awarded by the VA Central Contracting Office (VACO) under its multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The period of performance of that task order runs through March 21, 2013.  The VACO IDIQ contract has since expired and no new task orders can be issued under that contractual vehicle.  
A total of 308 hoteling seats and corresponding services are needed to accommodate current TAC and OIT employees and an additional 40 optional seats are planned to accommodate future growth.  Also required is the use of various conference rooms, a training room, storage rooms, source selection rooms, a computer technical support room, and other similar rooms/areas necessary for the effective and efficient function of an acquisition based organization and its customers and support staff.  The estimated award date of the contract is March 20, 2013.
In addition, the hoteling seats and services provided shall include, but not be limited to the following:

a.	Contiguous space either in private offices, cubicles or shared offices.  A campus setting is permitted as long as the buildings are contiguous to one another and within a short walking distance.

b.	Appropriate furnishings necessary for the office environment such as a desk, filing cabinets, trash receptacle, chair, guest chair and so forth such as one would find in a modern office setting of new condition and with appropriate form, fit and function.  Work spaces must have the ability to be secured by lock and key. This includes office doors, desk and cubicle pedestals, and other areas of the work space requiring such.  

c.	The space, furnishings, and amenities and appearance shall facilitate a professional office and working environment.  

d.	Space offered must be in a quality building of sound and substantial construction meeting the TAC's requirements for the intended use.

e.	The Contractor shall provide floor plans for the offered space and a valid Certificate of Occupancy for the intended use and shall meet, maintain, and operate the building in conformance with all applicable current codes and ordinances.

f.	Offered space shall meet or be upgraded to meet the applicable egress requirements in National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 101, Life Safety Code or an alternative approach or method for achieving a level of safety deemed equivalent and acceptable by the Government.  Offered space located below-grade, including parking garage areas, and all areas referred to as "hazardous areas" (defined in NFPA 101) within the entire building (including non-Government areas), shall be protected by an automatic sprinkler system or an equivalent level of safety.  Unrestricted access to a minimum of two remote exits shall be provided on each floor of Government occupancy.  Additional fire alarm system requirements will apply when offered space is located 2 or more stories in height above the lowest level of exit discharge.

g.	The building and the provided space shall be accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with ADA-ABA Accessibility Guidelines.

h.	The office area shall be free of all asbestos containing materials, except undamaged asbestos flooring in the space or undamaged boiler or pipe insulation outside the space, in which case an asbestos management program conforming to Environmental Protection Agency guidance shall be implemented. The space shall be free of other hazardous materials and in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local environmental laws and regulations.

i.	Services, utilities, and maintenance will be provided daily, extending from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. except Saturday, Sunday, and Federal holidays.  The Government shall have access to the provided space at all times, including the use of electrical services, toilets, lights, elevators, and Government office machines without additional payment.    

j.	The ability to co-locate a secure server in the communications room of the facility where the office services are provided.  If required, Government internet will be by Virtual Private Network until such time that the Government equipment is installed.  As a result, internet access is immediately required with sufficient bandwidth to support the number of personnel located in the facility in which the services are provided.  

k.	The normal environmental services shall be provided inclusive of the normal per person pricing for the service and include at a minimum: heat, electricity, power, water (hot and cold), snow removal, daily trash removal and janitorial, chilled drinking water, air conditioning, toilet supplies and sufficient restroom facilities, elevator service sufficient for the staff, lighting and replacement of lamps, tubes, and ballasts, window washing and carpet cleaning.

n.	Per person services for each work station shall include: modern digital multiline phone set with voice mail and call forwarding; internet access and wireless guest network; unlimited local and long distance phone calls.  

o.	Reception Services between 7:30 AM and 5:00 PM Monday through Friday except Government Holidays.

p.	Mail Receipt and Handling

q.	24/7 building/office access

r.	Dedicated Conference Rooms (servicing 12 to 15 persons comfortably) taking into consideration the number of hoteling seats and personnel being contracted.

s.	IT and Office services support during regular business hours for all contractor provided equipment.

t.	Audio and web conferencing access. 

u.	Administrative Assistance 

v.	Copier and fax services.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by VA.  Any information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>FedBizOpps <br />Request for Information FA8620-13-R-3012 <br />USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (I&amp;TS)
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Special Operations Forces (SOF) Directorate (AFLCMC/WI), ISR Sensors and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Division (AFLCMC/WIN) Contracting Offices 2640 Loop Road West, Rm 215, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7106, United States</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (I&amp;TS)<br /><br />Synopsis: AFLCMC/WIN manages the USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) program supporting the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities Working Group (GCWG). The GCWG manages and plans Air Force airborne GEOINT Capabilities Research, Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) investments. One of the key resources of the GCWG is the I&amp;TS portfolio. The I&amp;TS program identifies and provides limited funding to develop and demonstrate promising next-generation Air Force airborne GEOINT capabilities. A key focus of I&amp;TS is on the airborne sensor phenomenologies which include Electro/Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), Spectral-Multispectral (MSI)/Hyperspectral (HSI), Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR), Full Motion Video (FMV) and Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR).</p>
<p>Purpose: In support of the I&amp;TS program, AFLCMC/WIN is conducting market research across industry, academia and service/Government programs. The intent is to identify promising candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may improve current and future Air Force airborne GEOINT sensors and end-to-end-functionality. Market research will help identify what research has been accomplished in the field of GEOINT, as well as technologies that currently exist or could be modified to fill a need. Although FY13 and FY14 funding is uncertain, I&amp;TS managers are seeking 1 - 3 year projects that require funding of less than $1.5 million per year with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) between 4 and 6. AFLCMC/WIN seeks white papers and quad charts by 01 March 2013. All correspondence submitted will be protected and controlled as proprietary. After reviewing the submitted white papers, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondents' facilities. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY15-24 timeframe. The Government anticipates the information received will be used to plan and program the required efforts to support airborne GEOINT objectives. I&amp;TS candidates will be presented to the GCWG in the fall of 2013 for consideration.</p>
<p>The submitted white papers should identify potential candidate programs and technology efforts related to the development and demonstration of GEOINT sensors, associated on-board data algorithms and components supporting a functional end-to-end GEOINT architecture. Components may include: electronics, gimbals, cryogenics, diffraction gratings, focusing lenses, focal plan arrays, readout integrated circuits, atmospheric and temperature correction algorithms/techniques, airborne processing, interference filters, spectrometer, high resolution imagery subsystems, etc. Components do not need to be part of an existing sensor system; research and development of these components may be ongoing independent of a full system. However, the focus of I&amp;TS is on airborne (or on-board) GEOINT capabilities.</p>
<p>Background: Candidate I&amp;TS technologies may include persistent and/or wide area surveillance capabilities, on-board processing (vice ground processing) for multiple airborne platforms and sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities). AFLCMC/WIN requests information on the following ISR capabilities that will:</p>
<p>A. Support find, fix, track, target, assess for RPAs;<br />B. Detect and/or characterize camouflaged, concealment and deception (CC&amp;D) targets;<br />C. GEOINT in anti-access, denied areas; <br />D. Provide surveillance on open seas and littoral approaches;<br />E. Detect, characterize and track dismounts in densely populated areas;<br />F. Support Multi-INT collection in triple canopy jungle;<br />G. Detect, ID and track personnel of interest;<br />H. Collect and characterize information on underground facilities;<br />I. Significantly exceed current bandwidth and onboard data storage requirements;<br />J. Provide all-weather motion imagery.</p>
<p>The following ground rules/assumptions apply:</p>
<p>1. For solely component technologies - clearly explain how the component will benefit end-to-end sensor operations and functionality <br />2. Candidate programs will be considered for integration with deployed airborne platforms operating at various altitudes to support specific operational conditions. They must be compatible with existing processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) networks <br />3. If applicable, responses shall identify any new supporting architecture or infrastructure (i.e., cryogenics, processing/PED, computer resources, storage requirements, environmental requirements, ground control, communications, etc.) required for the technology<br />4. If applicable, responses must identify any Unique Tool and/or Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE), as well as any proven integration (have they been flown / tested?)<br />5. Responses must provide identify technical and security POC (name/telephone/e-mail)<br />==============<br />Responses: The Government invites industry to submit White Papers and a Quad Chart at the unclassified or classified levels up to TS/SCI at any time on or before 01 March 2013. Guidance on the suggested White Paper and Quad Chart is attached. When submitting classified responses to this RFI, please ensure all appropriate security procedures and policies are followed.</p>
<p>Please restrict White Paper page count to no more than 3 pages in length and submit electronically or via mail (regular mail for UNCLASSIFIED; Registered mail for SECRET to the points of contact stated below. Do not submit TS/SCI by mail, only on JWICS, and only if it is coordinated and approved by the appropriate government agency/sponsor.</p>

OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between NIH and the extramural research communities, other federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.</p>
<p>OBSSR works to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR uses various communications tactics as a key approach to achieving its strategic aims, allowing OBSSR to communicate with key audiences, such as the general public, NIH partners, the behavioral and social science communities, the broader research communities and stakeholders such as practitioners and policymakers to support the NIH mission.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 811219 for an upcoming requirement for the Central Mineral and Environmental Resources Science Center at the Federal Center in Denver, CO for maintenance services for JEOL scanning electron microscope model number JSM-5800LV CLD and model number JXA-8900 scanning microprobe.  The offeror must have JEOL factory trained and authorized service engineers with current and specified training for these microscope models that can respond to on-site service calls within 24 hours.  There shall be a minimum of two factory trained and authorized service engineers with specific training for the JOEL JXA 8900 Electron Microprobe and the JOEL JSM-5800LV CLD as well as other factory trained engineers that can be brought in if the primary service engineers are unavailable to meet critical response times.  Response time for on-site service calls must be within 24 hours.  A preventive maintenance (PM) shall be performed on both pieces of equipment at least twice per contract year and prices shall include all consumable parts for PM service performed.  It is critical that the successful offeror have immediate access to JEOL replacement parts for these models, due to the equipments criticality to the USGS geologic discipline mission. Replacement parts must be made available within 24 hours of the initial service call, performance and repairs must be completed within 2 business days of a service call that cannot be resolved with telephone support, with a requirement of zero down time for the instruments. The successful offeror shall provide telephone support for repair and maintenance Monday through Friday 8:30 AM to 5 PM, MST, except holidays.  The offeror must also have authorization for direct communication with the JEOL manufacturer in Japan for issues such as software maintenance and software upgrades and perform upgrades/updates as deemed necessary by the equipment manufacturer. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary. 
Project Description: The USGS maintains and operates a JEOL model number 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL model number JXA-8900 electron microprobe located in the Denver Microbeam Laboratory, Building 20, Denver Federal Center.  The instruments provide critical analytical research data for geologic discipline programs.  The instruments also provide data for USGS and other federal agency (OFA) clients. The two fully automated instruments operate daily, overnight and weekends.  The JEOL 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe are often scheduled weeks to months in advance including scheduling for out of town researchers who travel to Denver specifically to use these instruments.  The instruments are both comprised of several critical subsystems including an electron optical column, an electronics console, PC, and a variety of data output devices.  The JEOL 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe must be maintained in full operating condition and to the manufacturers specifications at all times.  This is necessary because of the strict scientific requirements of Mission area scientists as well as the Mission Areas obligations to OFA clients.  In order to meet these requirements, a full service contract for instrument preventative maintenance and repair is critical.  The instruments must be maintained with highest priority service by JEOL factory trained, authorized service personnel in order to ensure proper maintenance and repair and to prevent damage to the instruments.    A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.
Responses to this announcement are requested from (1) SBA certified Small Business HubZone firms; (2) Small Business firms certified by a Small Business Administration (SBA) district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; (3) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small Business firms; (4) Small Businesses and (5) Large Businesses. 
In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.
A firm is considered small under NAICS code 811219 if their AVERAGE annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to $19.0 million. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from firms in categories (1) through (4) above, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.
Interested business firms shall submit (1) NAME, ADDRESS, and PHONE NUMBER OF THE FIRM (including DUNS NUMBER); (2) a CAPABILITY STATEMENT including (a) RECENT (within the last three fiscal years) RELEVANT (similar projects to this requirement) performance history (identify the name of the owner and their point(s) of contact with telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses; and (b) in what capacity (e.g., prime, subcontractor etc.) they performed the work; and (3) their SIZE STATUS. 
Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM). You will also be required to provide your small business status information either via the RFP or the On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) also located at the SAM website before an award to your company can be made. Your on-line ORCA registration will cover any/all of your offers to the Federal Government, and only needs updated annually.
All responses must be submitted NLT February 8, 2013 at 3:00pm MST via e-mail to: cleonard@usgs.gov.
This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<DESC>Construction of Fish Passage Facility ($32 M) sources sought announcements:
<p>REPOSTED: This same sources sought announcement for the above stated projet is alos being advertised under NAICS 237990 and 236220 Sources Sought Announcement numbers W912HN-13-Z-0003 and W912HN-13-Z-0003-01</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the government in any contract award. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District is issuing this Sources Sought announcement for the construction of a Fish Passage Facility to determine interest, availability and capability of business to perform the work as described below. The New Savannah Bluff Lock &amp; Dam (NSBL&amp;D) is located on the Savannah River at River Mile 187.4, approximately 13 miles downstream from the City of Augusta, Georgia. This facility is the most downstream lock and dam along the Savannah River and is authorized for the purpose of improving the commercial navigation channel between the upper limits of the Savannah Harbor and the head of navigation at Augusta, Georgia. It was constructed by the Corps and was completed in 1937.</p>
<p>The dam structure is 360 ft long and contains five vertical spillway gates. The lock is located along the right abutment (Georgia Side) and measures approximately 56 ft wide and 360 ft long, with a maximum lift height of approximately 15 ft. The facility provides ponding upstream to support several water intakes and recreation for the City's of Augusta, GA and North Augusta, SC. The fish passage is designed to allow Shortnose sturgeon, a federally listed endangered species, as well as several other species including Atlantic sturgeon, shad and robust redhorse, access to shoals upstream of the dam where their historic spawning habitat is located.</p>
<p>A conceptual design of the fish passage facility has been completed and is included in this project description. The fish passage would be constructed adjacent to the dam on existing high ground on the South Carolina bank of the river. Preliminary hydraulic modeling efforts estimate the structure to be approximately 250 feet wide and 2000 feet long. The work to be conducted includes access road construction, clearing and grubbing approximately 18 acres, excavation and grading of up to 300,000 cy of material, and placement of approximately 20,000 tons of bedding stone, 88,000 tons of armor stone, and 8,800 tons of tons of weir stone to construct the fish passage facility. The weir stones will require specific placement locations to provide for successful fish passage. Two existing overflow gates in the dam structure will modified. Modification of the gates will require dewatering in the immediate area of the gates.</p>
<p>No in-water work will be allowed downstream of the dam during the period between February 1 and May 31. Care must be taken at all times to prevent interference with migrating species. Construction must be done in a manner so as not to interfere with operation of the dam and lock or damage of the existing structure.</p>

If the contractor believes the policies and guidance provided by the COR is a material unilateral change to the contract, the contractor must elevate such concerns to the Contracting Officer for resolution.
h.	I will report suspected or identified information security/privacy incidents to the COR and to the local ISO or Privacy Officer as appropriate.
2. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR
a.	Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program. Users must understand that taking personal responsibility for the security of their computer and the information it contains is an essential part of their job.
b.	The following rules apply to all VA contractors. I agree to:
(1)	Follow established procedures for requesting, accessing, and closing user accounts and access. I will not request or obtain access beyond what is normally granted to users or by what is outlined in the contract.
(2)	Use only systems, software, databases, and data which I am authorized to use, including any copyright restrictions.
(3)	I will not use other equipment (OE) (non-contractor owned) for the storage, transfer, or processing of VA sensitive information without a VA CIO approved waiver, unless it has been reviewed and approved by local management and is included in the language of the contract. If authorized to use OE IT equipment, I must ensure that the system meets all applicable 6500 Handbook requirements for OE.
(4)	Not use my position of trust and access rights to exploit system controls or access information for any reason other than in the performance of the contract.
(5)	Not attempt to override or disable security, technical, or management controls unless expressly permitted to do so as an explicit requirement under the contract or at the direction of the COR or ISO. If I am allowed or required to have a local administrator account on a government-owned computer, that local administrative account does not
confer me unrestricted access or use, nor the authority to bypass security or other controls except as expressly permitted by the VA CIO or CIO's designee.
(6)	Contractors' use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply.
(7)	Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know.
(8)	Protect passwords from access by other individuals.
(9)	Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question.
(10)	Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA.
(11)	Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COR's orders.
(12)	Ensure that the COR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs.
(13)	Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COR.
(14)	Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COR.
(15)	Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COR's orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA.
(16)	Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COR.
(17)	Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system.
(18)	Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.
3. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON- VA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES
a.	When required to complete work under the contract, I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible. If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA approved remote access software and services.
b.	Remote access to non-public VA information technology resources is prohibited from publicly-available IT computers, such as remotely connecting to the internal VA network from computers in a public library.
c.	I will not have both a VA network line and any kind of non-VA network line including a wireless network card, modem with phone line, or other network device physically connected to my computer at the same time, unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized by the COR.
d.	I understand that I may not obviate or evade my responsibility to adhere to VA security requirements by subcontracting any work under any given contract or agreement with VA, and that any subcontractor(s) I engage shall likewise be bound by the same security requirements and penalties for violating the same.
4. STATEMENT ON LITIGATION
This User Agreement does not and should not be relied upon to create any other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law, by a party to litigation with the United States Government.
5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
I acknowledge receipt of this User Agreement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (NCD), on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center, intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis to Thornhill Research Inc, for research and development of a Battery Backup for the Mobile Anesthesia Delivery Module (MADM), Ruggedization, Environmental and FDA Testing.  The purpose of this effort is to ruggedize the MADM design for the intended environment, and conduct environmental and FDA submission related testing on the resulting MADM design.  In order to extend the mission capability in austere environments, the contractor will also develop and test an external battery backup capability for MADM of up to 5 hours.  The objective of this effort is to provide a continuum of care from forward to rear echelons, through surgery and transport.  Since the Forward Resuscitative Surgical Suite (FRSS) is portable and designed for helicopter deployment, the cube and weight of all components associated with the FRSS must be kept at a minimum.  Use of the MADM will significantly reduce the cube and weight of FRSS components and allow maximum flexibility in delivery of critical care in the field.   Thornhill Research Inc, a foreign business located in Toronto, Ontario is the only responsible source for this effort based on Market Research and Past Performance.  As such, this contract will be awarded to Thornhill Research Inc.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to extend an existing contract on a sole source basis to ATAMIR-WSMR LLC, 1300 Britt St SE, Albuquerque, NM 87123-3353, for the Test Engineering and Analysis Services (TE&AS) contract at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. The proposed contract action will extend the performance period of Contract W9124Q-08-C-0547 by six months under the provisions of statutory authority 10 U.S.C.   2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The estimated dollar value of this action is $11,024,751 for the period of performance of 1 April 2013 through 30 September 2013. <br>  <br> The Government's intent is to extend the current services with ATAMIR-WSMR in order to continue performance of the required services until the fully competitive follow-on contract can be solicited, negotiated, and awarded. Award to any other source at this time would negatively impact WSMR's ability to perform its mission. It would be impossible for any other contractor to perform all of the highly specialized services required for the TE&AS functions without causing an unacceptable delay in the performance of the mission and incurring an additional cost burden.   <br>  <br> Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to: cynthia.m.uribe.civ@mail.mil, no later than 14 February 2013 at 4PM MST. Comments submitted for consideration of other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Center for Development (NCOD) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with RNR Coaching CO to continue to purchase consulting services in the field of executive coaching, program evaluation and research administration.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541720.   The Government believes that RNR Coaching CO is the only provider that can satisfy the agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to proceed with a sole source procurement for the required supplies and or services. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. To the best of our knowledge, RNR Coaching CO, Cambridge, MA is the only source that provides the above indicated services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, Network Contracting Office 10, 260 East University Ave., Cincinnati, OH, 45219 or via fax to (513) 559-3730.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Cincinnati VA Medical Center will precede with the sole source negotiation with RNR Coaching CO, Cincinnati, OH.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-01-372-3102<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Letter Size, 1 Divider, 4 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, legal size, 1 divider, 4 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners, 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is BX. BX = 10 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1098<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Letter Size, 2 Dividers, 6 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, letter size, 2 dividers, 6 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners. 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point Type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is BX. BX = 10 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1099<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Legal Size, 1 Divider, 4 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, legal size, 1 divider, 4 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners, 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is BX. BX = 5 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1100<br />Name:		Folder, File, Hanging, Legal Size, 2 Dividers, 6 Sections, Light Blue<br />Description:	Recycled hanging classification folder, legal size, 2 dividers, 6 sections, 2/5 right of center top tab, light blue. Pivoting hangers fold down for carry along convenience. 25 point pressboard covers with 1" capacity bonded fasteners, 17 point Kraft divider with 1" capacity dual fastener, 2" Tyvek expansion gusset bottom. Folders use 25 point type III pressboard with 60% total recycled fiber and at least 30% PCW. The 17 point Kraft dividers contain at least 30% PCW. UOI is BX. BX = 5 folders.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-01-372-3102<br />ETS Stock Numbers: 	ESS-59251: SMD-65105</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1098<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59252; SMD-65115</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1099<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59351; SMD-65155</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1100<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ESS-59352; SMD-65165</p>
<p><br />The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 13, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE: AFDW/PK Contracting Directorate intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to CALIBRE Systems, Inc (CALIBRE) using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This contract will allow CALIBRE to finalize and implement the materials and instruction for the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) basic training classes for FY13 as a result of feedback received from the pilot classes held in FY12. The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 611710. Persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.
<p>CALIBRE developed the course material and assembled a team familiar with the requirements of the AFWCF and with the materials to be presented in this course. They have the personnel familiar with the subject and with the course material readily available to continue the work with no stoppage in work. The Air Force believes that this team is the only one that can teach the FY13 classes and capture the feedback necessary to make final revisions and corrections to the material since they have been working with the AFWCF in developing this course since its inception. Furthermore, only CALIBRE has a team familiar with the materials for this class that can make any needed adjustments in time to be able to make this training a standard course available with no stoppage in work and no delay to the FY13 classes. The Air Force expects that once this work is finished and the course materials are completed and tested that a new contract will be awarded through competition to teach the course in FY14 and the years following.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, the Government will consider all responses received by 14 February 2013, 1:00 PM Eastern Time. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in preparation of quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Notice of Intent (PUR-13-0145) to award a sole source contract to Chesapeake Defense Services, Inc. (Chesapeake), under the authority of FAR 13.106 based on their unique technical qualifications as the only known vendor with the capability to provide the urgent&nbsp;required scans, that is within the required locality requirement, and has the availability within the required timeframe to complete the scans. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)&nbsp;knows of no other sources capable of meeting the scanning requirement within the timeframe described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to provide services that performs the required work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background<br /></strong>The&nbsp;NTSB is an independent Federal agency with the primary missions of investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.<br /><br />The NTSB is planning to conduct teardown examinations as soon as possible of an aircraft battery similar to one involved in an aircraft incident. This urgent requirement is in support of accident investigation DCA13IA037 that occurred in Boston, MA. To facilitate those examinations, Computed Tomography (CT) scans of that battery and its&nbsp;subcomponents are required to non-destructively determine as much information as possible about those components. In addition, batteries and battery cells of the same type which have been subjected to known test conditions will also be scanned. Since these batteries are of the lithium ion type and have substantial shipping restrictions (including a requirement for ground shipping only using specially qualified hazardous materials shippers which would cause a delay of several days to accommodate), these scans need to be conducted at a location close to Washington, D.C. to allow the NTSB to transport the battery to the Contractor and thereby avoid shipping and other logistical complications. They must also be completed within the shortest timeframe possible to provide the fastest possible receipt of this information to avoid potential future accidents involving this type of aircraft battery. The NTSB has a requirement for CT scanning services to begin on 01/31/2013. Therefore, this requirement is urgent. <br /><br />The NTSB has a requirement for CT scans of eight (8) Boeing 787 batteries cells. The Contractor shall include additional line items for additional scanning work that may be required for up to 40 additional battery cells or their equivalent scanning effort to be used as needed at the discretion of the NTSB. In addition, the NTSB requires at least 2 digital radiographs per component (90 degrees apart).<br /><br />Chesapeake utilizes 450 kV and 320 kV micro-focus CT scanning equipment that is more powerful than the industry standard at these focal spot sizes. The NTSB requires use of this equipment and this equipment is only known to be available locally from Chesapeake. This more powerful equipment allows them to conduct scans of extremely dense objects, like lithium-ion aircraft batteries, while delivering high resolution scans that are required by the investigation.<br /><br />In this instance,&nbsp;the NTSB is seeking to have Chesapeake provide the CT scanning services due to their unique ability to provide the required scans, their ability to provide scans compatible with previous results, their proximity to Washington, D.C. and their ability to quickly respond to the required time frame for this urgent requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Required Services<br /></strong>1. Task Area 1 - Digital Radiograph (DR) of Component: The Contractor shall produce a DR of the component that shows the entire part or region of interest, as designated by the NTSB. The DR image shall be produced with the highest level of resolution possible, unless otherwise directed by the NTSB. The Contractor shall supply all parts and labor required to mount the component as required to be scanned in their equipment. <br /><br />2. Task Area 2 - CT Scan of Component: The Contractor shall produce a CT scan of the component that shows the entire region of interest, as designated by the NTSB. CT scan images shall be produced with the smallest slice thickness and highest level of resolution as possible (consistent with producing the best possible images), unless otherwise directed by the NTSB. The images should be free of artifacts. The Contractor shall supply all parts and labor required to mount the component as required to be scanned in their equipment. <br /><br />3. Task Area 3 - Post Processing of Images: Post processing of images may or may not be required for each item to be scanned. The Contractor, upon direction from the NTSB, shall provide re-processed images showing zoomed areas, multi-planar reconstructed images, or other images as may be applicable.<br /><br /><strong>Standards<br /></strong>All tasks shall be conducted on equipment that is maintained and calibrated on a schedule that is in accordance with best industry practices for radiological equipment.

<DESC>***The intention of this announcement is to notify industry of the Governments intent to sole source the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system which is part of the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Miller Pumping Station, this is not a synopsis for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Miller Pumping Station *** <br>  <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit on a Sole Source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system of the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Miller Pumping Station, which consists of brand name components and accessories for the following items: Ethernet network switches, programmable logic controllers, touch screens, radios, antennas, satellite voice communication system, routers, firewall, multiplexers, video camera recorder, remote terminal units, solar equipment, security cameras, security alarm panels, security management system platform, fire alarm panels, monitoring systems, card readers, computers, printers, sensors, surge protectors, patch panels, port entry panels, building entrance terminals, and battery systems. The SCADA system allows many water control structures to be operated and monitored remotely. It will operate 24 hours a day and will be designed to operate during hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. The Miller Pumping Station will be part of a much larger system that South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) uses to remotely operate and monitor its structures.  <br>  <br> The anticipated dollar amount of the sole sourced SCADA equipment is $800,000.00. <br>  <br> The components listed above have been specifically selected due to their performance interoperability as part of an entire telemetry system. Substitution with similar components could present a considerable risk to life and property. The system as a whole provides standardization in training, maintenance, warehousing, and interchangeability during potential life threatening weather events.  <br>  <br> The Picayune Strand Restoration Project (PSRP) will restore more than 55,000 acres of land located in southwestern Collier County, Florida to a healthy and functional wetland system. The plan for the Project is to remove the infrastructure of a subdivision and restore its pre-drainage hydrology and ecology, generating positive effects on the hydrology, vegetation, and wildlife of the project area and surrounding public lands. In addition, the existing road network within PSRP will be taken down to grade with a limited portion of the roads remaining above grade. <br>  <br> The plan for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Miller Pumping Station, calls for the construction of a pumping station, tie-back levees, spreader cells, and canal plugs to slow water flowing through existing canals and distribute it across the landscape. The Miller Pumping Station will have six 235-cfs engine-driven pumps and two 75-cfs electric motor-driven pumps.  <br>  <br> The magnitude of construction of the project is $25,000,000.00-$100,000,000.00. The work is in Collier County, Florida. A solicitation for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Miller Pumping Station will be issued on or about 7 May 2013 with proposals due on or about 26 June 2013. <br>  <br> Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to the work described in paragraph 1 and respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen calendars days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br>  <br> Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Ian McClary at 904-232-2179 or email at Ian.R.McClary@usace.army.mil.  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Agency Name -<br /><br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <br />National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health <br />Office of Mine Safety and Health Research <br />Post Office Box 18070 <br />626 Cochrans Mill Road <br />Pittsburgh PA 15236-0070 <br /><br />B. Research Opportunity Title - Refuge Alternative Concepts for Deployment Near the Face of Coal Mines<br /><br />C. Program Name - Office of Mine Safety and Health Research<br /><br />D. Research Opportunity - Number 2013-N-14957<br /><br />E. Response Date - This announcement will remain open until 04/01/13. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Proposals may be submitted any time during this period</strong></span>. <br /><br />F. Research Opportunity Description -<br /><br />Objective: <br /><br />The objective of these research contracts is to develop innovative new approaches to providing refuge alternatives (RAs) in underground coal mines which can be advanced to within 1,000 feet of the working face. NIOSH is looking for concepts which overcome the barriers to employing built-in-place (BIP) type RAs which can be advanced with the working face. These new approaches must:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Meet the criteria for RAs as spelled out in the MSHA final rule.1<br /><br />2. Address the issue of improved psychological and ergonomic comfort within the chambers by <br />providing additional living space per confined miner. <br /><br />3. Provide as much breathable air per confined miner as possible with the minimum being that <br />required in the MSHA final rule.1<br /><br />4. Allow for advancement with the face in an economically viable manner.
<p>The proposed innovative approaches can include as part of their design, but are not limited to, ideas for mobile (moveable) RA stoppings, inflatable stopping concepts, protected compressed air lines, more compact and greater volume O2 and/or breathable air supply systems, and alternative approaches to borehole planning and placement. <br /><br />While NIOSH Office of Mine Safety and Health Research's (OMSHR) primary interest is in innovative RA designs that can be advanced with the mining face, it should not be ruled out that these designs could also have application in outby locations. <br /><br />Background:<br /><br />With the introduction of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER ACT)2, following the Sago Mine disaster, coal mine operators began to introduce refuge alternatives (RAs) into their underground mines. The first of these went into place in 2007 and consisted mainly of mobile chambers provided by a number of vendors. These are either solid steel structures or inflatable-type structures which provide purging and breathing air from compressed air or O2 cylinders. Today, there are approximately 1,700 of these mobile units employed in underground coal mines in the U.S. The other available RA option is that of built-in-place (BIP) shelters. These are typically constructed by building rigid RA stoppings at both ends of a crosscut with one or both of the stoppings having a door. Another option is to construct a BIP shelter by building a RA stopping with a door at the end of a cutout (dead-ended heading in the coal). Breathable air and purging air can be provided to these BIP shelters either by boreholes to the surface, compressed air lines, or by compressed air and O2 cylinders similar to the systems used in the mobile RAs. When MSHA's final rule on RAs went into effect on March 2, 20091, it mandated that BIP shelters must have stoppings, including a door that would withstand a 15-psi static pressure. This negated the use of many of the existing BIP shelters because they did not receive MSHA approval as meeting the mandated 15-psi criteria. Today, there are a small number of BIP shelters in underground mines in the U.S. Many of these meet the MSHA 15-psi criteria, but some are still employing conventional stoppings and are slowly being replaced either with approved RA stopping designs or with mobile chambers. <br /><br />BIP shelters without boreholes or breathable air supplied by a protected compressed air line have limited advantages over mobile RAs, in that their size is also limited by the amount of purging and breathable air that can be provided by compressed air and O2 tanks. However, BIP shelters with boreholes or breathable air supplied by a compressed air line from the surface offer a number of safety and other advantages: <br /><br />1. A BIP shelter with a borehole solves many of the problems associated with air purging and air scrubbing. It is easy to create a positive pressure in the chamber with clean breathable air. Air supply in place systems (compressed air or O2 cylinders) put significant limits on the total air available, but air from a borehole is unlimited for the most part. Breathable air provided by a protected compressed air line source can also accomplish this objective if the supply can be guaranteed. <br /><br />2. With BIP shelters with boreholes, some of the thermal issues associated with mobile chambers are eliminated. Cooler air can be provided from the surface and the larger available fresh air volume helps to provide for more efficient dissipation of heat and humidity. <br /><br />3. Communication with the surface is much easier and more reliable when the BIP shelter has a borehole. The communication system has a much greater chance of surviving an explosion or fire. Additionally, if the communication system is damaged by a disaster, it can easily be re-established down the borehole. <br /><br />4. Additional food, water, and specific medical supplies can be provided down a borehole.<br /><br />5. BIP shelters with a constant supply of fresh air can generally be made larger and provide more available room for miners, eliminating many of the psychological and ergonomic issues of long-term confinement. This makes life in the shelter more like that experienced by the Chilean miners trapped underground for 69 days in 2010. <br /><br />6. BIP shelters with boreholes or compressed air lines have fewer requirements with regard to miners learning how to operate the chamber. There are no purging and air scrubbing systems to operate since they are not needed if adequate air is provided down a borehole or via a constant supply compressed air line.<br /><br />7. The 96 hour survival time is not a constraint since there is an unlimited supply of fresh breathable air and potential access to additional food and water if a borehole is employed. This eliminates the psychological "ticking clock" aspect of mobile RAs. <br /><br />8. An existing borehole will ensure that a larger escape shaft will be drilled in the correct location.<br /><br />9. The order in which miners arrive at a BIP shelter is much less important since purging air is not limited. Also, if some miners decide to leave a BIP shelter and others decide to stay, there is still an adequate supply of breathable air available to keep the chamber livable. <br /><br />10. Depending upon a number of economic issues (borehole costs, cost of protected compressed air lines, stopping costs) BIP shelters can often be very cost competitive with mobile units. <br /><br />Despite these advantages, there are limitations on the use of BIP shelters since in many cases the costs of providing boreholes or compressed air lines may be prohibitive. Additionally, BIP shelters with approved RA stoppings are not generally practical to establish within 1,000 feet of the working face as required by MSHA regulations1, since the shelters constantly need to advance with the face, making new borehole and stopping costs prohibitive. <br /><br />With respect to the mobile units currently being employed, while manufacturers are providing units that are innovatively designed to sustain life for 96 hours, there appears to be limited confidence on the part of coal miners concerning their use. Miners generally state that they would not consider entering a mobile unit. They have significant concerns about heat problems, purging problems, uncertain communication, and other issues. Additionally, there is concern over the serious psychological issues that will arise from confinement in a very limited space for any period of time. Finally, mobile units are limited in the available living space they can provide for two reasons:<br /><br />1. They need to be small enough to be readily moved through the mine and constantly advanced to within 1,000 feet of the working face. Therefore, their height always has to be at least several inches less than the height of the coal seam and their widths and lengths have to be short enough to make the turns into crosscuts. <br /><br />2. They rely on compressed air and O2 cylinders for purging and breathing air and they require CO2 scrubbing systems both of which must be adequate for 96 hours of survival. These tanks and scrubbing systems take up some of the available space in the chambers and also limit the size of the chambers to the amount of life-sustaining air they can provide. <br /><br />Need:<br /><br />Given that RAs will only be employed under disaster conditions when miners are under extreme emotional stress, every effort needs to be made to provide RAs that are easy to employ, provide the highest practical level of psychological and ergonomic comfort, and the greatest confidence of survival. Serious consideration needs to be given to the following: <br /><br />&bull; Providing miners with enough confidence to use RAs in emergency situations when escape is not practical; <br /><br />&bull; The simplicity of employing the RA; <br /><br />&bull; Enough breathable air supply to increase the likelihood of miners surviving for extended periods of time in a RA; <br /><br />&bull; Heat and humidity concerns; <br /><br />&bull; Availability of communication systems; <br /><br />&bull; The psychological and ergonomic issues associated with confinement. <br /><br />The option exists for mines to provide BIP shelters as their choice of RAs in outby locations, but current BIP shelter designs would be prohibitively expensive to constantly advance within 1,000 feet of the working face due to the borehole and stopping costs associated with approved RAs. Innovative concepts for RAs near the face area of mines are needed which will both provide miners with a higher degree of confidence in entering them and ensure that they can adequately provide life-sustaining conditions for extended periods of time. <br /><br />The NIOSH OMSHR is interested in funding a number of research service contracts to generate these innovative concepts for providing RAs which can be advanced with the working face of a coal mines. As many as twenty (20) of these research service contracts will be awarded for up to $25,000 each (awards up to $50,000 may be awarded if justified by the potential of the proposed concept). Total available funding is $500,000. The period of performance of each service contract is not to exceed 6 months total. The possibility exists for additional future funding to further advance development of a proposed concept that the NIOSH OMSHR deems worthy of more consideration. <br /><br />References:<br /><br />1 Federal Register (2008).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>Description(s):</p>
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0003 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812320 with a Small Business Size Standard of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the contractor with the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2497 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2497<br />Diane C.

<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes<br />the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br />wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br />similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms, Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (JUL 2006) (Deviation) and 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.

<p><strong>HSAR 3052.209-72 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (JUN 2006)</strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting, if applicable, will be specified on each task order.</p>
<p>(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.</p>
<p>(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.</p>
<p>(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.</p>
<p>(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.</p>
<p>(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ideograph-numeric; mso-layout-grid-align: auto; punctuation-wrap: hanging; mso-vertical-align-alt: auto">It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ideograph-numeric; mso-layout-grid-align: auto; punctuation-wrap: hanging; mso-vertical-align-alt: auto"><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ideograph-numeric; mso-layout-grid-align: auto; punctuation-wrap: hanging; mso-vertical-align-alt: auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ideograph-numeric; mso-layout-grid-align: auto; punctuation-wrap: hanging; mso-vertical-align-alt: auto">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(2)</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(g)<em> Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). </em>The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(h)<em> Multiple awards</em>. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

<DESC><p>Amendment 0006 to the Eglin AFB solicitation SPE600-12-R-0827 has been posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website and can be found at www.fbo.gov. The purpose of the amendment is to revise the cut-off date for JCP Certification. Please note: It is the responsibility of each offeror to review Amendment 0006 for all changes from the solicitation document.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/.</p>
<p>If you are registered in CCR, once you click on the secured document link in the FBO, it should prompt you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form, in order to complete the Joint Certification Program (JCP) certification. All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well. DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.</p>
<p>UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING JCP: DLA Energy will no longer accommodate those vendors that have not received certification through JCP by providing information via DVD/CD with the submission of the DD2345, effective January 16, 2013. Please ensure DLA Energy is immediately made aware of any issues with receiving your certification.</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Test Chamber which was posted on 01/24/2013. You are notified that the following changes are made: Questions and Responses. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Question 1:  What is the time required to bring a test article down to -45 C? Answer 1:  The project is for a long term storage experiment, therefore fast ramp times are not required. From market research, the requester found that the limiting factor on ramp times for a large chamber is the limitations of the structural integrity of the chamber walls themselves during a fast temperature swing. A 48 hour ramp from ambient temperature is a reasonable goal. Question 2: What is the material of construction of a typical object? Answer 2:  The objects will be placed in the chamber and will not be taken in and out except for sampling purposes. The bulk materials in the chamber can be estimated as 300 lbs of rubber, 100 lbs of aluminum, 500 lbs of steel. There will be no heat generating devices in the chamber. Question 3: Is there a similar chamber in service now? If so, what refrigeration capacity is required? Answer 3: There is not a similar chamber in service now. The system design (Chamber R-values, infiltration rates, etc. will be the largest driver for refrigeration capacity. Questions/Answers 1, 2, 4, 5 provides additional information about system loads, personnel access, and infiltration levels.   Question 4: How often will the chamber door be opened and for what period of time? Answer 4: Personnel may access the chamber while in operation for observation purposes and the chamber should be able to withstand being open and closed for personnel access. Frequency of the access should be no more than once a week, and personnel presence should be no longer than 30 minutes.	 Question 5: Are any drawings/sketches available. Answer 5: There are not any drawing/sketches available. The requested chamber is essentially a structural box of the stated dimensions. The user will be penetrating the wall of the chamber in two locations. A steel pipe of approximately 3 diameter will exit the roof and a wiring harness of approximately 2 diameter will penetrate a side wall. Question 6: Please elaborate more on Embedded IT for the purpose of operating chamber (feedback and control) shall be proposed where applicable. Do you have a more detailed feedback and control spec? Answer 6: During market research, the user found that some chambers utilize a control system that has the capability of being remote controlled, gather data acquisition, etc. Some designs may utilize a similar system for feedback and control of the operation of chamber. If a controller, computer, or something other than a standard thermostat is utilized or required to operate the system, it shall be included as part of the proposal. If such a controller is proposed, which also provides additional capabilities such as data logging, remote monitoring, etc., the user would request that specification on the additional capabilities be provided as part of the proposal for review. Question 7: Is a manufacturer warranty of 1 year acceptable? Answer 7: The project that the chamber will be used on is an 18 month project of which approximately 12 months the chamber will be used in the test operation. Given uncertainties of schedule slip, delivery dates, startup, checkout, etc. the user needs the product to be working for a period of at least two-years. The project budget does not allow for a backup chamber therefore a failed non-warranted chamber during this period would likely lead to a failed project. The project risk will have to be evaluated based on your overall submitted proposal. Based on previous market research, it is believed that a two-year warranty on a refrigeration system is within a normal scope of what is being offered on the market and that many manufactures additionally have extended or special warranties available beyond the standard listed warranties. If after consulting with the manufacture of the product being offered, the warranty requirement still cannot be met, list the discrepancy in the proposal and it will be evaluated accordingly. Question 8: Is the following power requirements acceptable: Manufacturer MOP is 70 @ 208-230/60/3? Answer 8: Most likely. The requirement listed is 220V/50 MOP which to clarify is based off of current planned facility power and was not intended to indicate that the MOP of the device has to be exactly 50. Three phase power is available for use. The user will consider modifying facility power to match the power requirements of the manufactures specification, within reason. Please provide the full power requirements including both MCA and MOP in your submittal. Question 9: If I have a product that meets most but not all of the specification requirements, should I continue to submit the bid and indicate the differences in our quote? Answer 9: Please submit the bid. In a perfect world with an unlimited budget, one would require all requirements to be met. It is not known until after all of the proposals are received if anyone will propose a product that can meet all of the requirements or within a planned budget. Please be sure to highlight any known discrepancies in your proposal. The proposals will be evaluated weighing cost/scope against the users needs/budget.

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The Offeror shall also specifically address its capability to perform helium leak testing to the required maximum leak rate.</p>
<p>3) Experience: The Contractor shall describe their experience manufacturing the same or similar storage tanks; explain how their experience is relevant to this requirement and how their experience will ensure successful completion of the deuterium storage tank. Contractor shall also describe their experience with helium leak testing.</p>
<p>4) Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p><br />Acceptance of Terms and Conditions (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 (b) (11)): This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are equal to price.</p>
<p>Technical Approach: Evaluation of technical approach shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed technical approach is capable of meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed technical approach is capable of meeting these requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not address a certain minimum requirement in its proposed technical approach, NIST will determine that it does not meet.<br />As noted in specification 7.4, stronger consideration will be given for a leak rate that does not exceed 1-x10-9 std. cc/sec for either test.</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience in fabricating deuterium storage tanks and helium leak testing, and will consider the relevance of the offeror's experience to the current requirement.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Approach Evaluation factor.</p>
<p><br />1352.233-70 AGENCY PROTESTS (APR 2010) <br />(a) An agency protest may be filed with either (1) the Contracting Officer, or (2) at a level above the Contracting Officer, with the agency Protest Decision Authority.

The NAICS Code is 238160 with a size standard of $14.0 million, construction, roof repairs. This requirement is 100% set aside for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.
This acquisition is solicited pursuant to Public Law 109-461, 38 USC section 8127, as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside. Additionally, this acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process (LPTA). The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price contract for the roof repair requirement.
Bids over $100,000 must include a bid bond.

Successful offeror(s) will be required to be actively registered in System for Award Management (SAM), upon submission of proposal. Due to the urgent need of roof repairs, if vendors are not active in SAM, this could be a reason for non-responsiveness. Offeror(s) not already registered in the SAM database are highly encouraged to register via internet at www.sam.gov.

SCOPE OF WORK

The St. Petersburg Regional Office's current roof is in a deteriorating condition.  The area of concern is the roof area around the skylight, and the numerous equipment penetrations through the roof.  Correction is needed of the negative roof deck slope that directs water towards the base of the skylight. Per current recommendations of the National Roofing Contractors Association, standing seam metal roofs should have a minimum positive drainage slope of " per foot of run. Upon review of the original building plans and details, a positive drainage slope of minimum " per foot of run was indicated for the metal roof deck. While on six of the eight skylight sides the roof does appear to have a positive drainage slope away to the building perimeter, the two problematic areas do not. The decking appears to have been subject to excessive deflection between the purlin support elements directly at the skylight perimeter, resulting in a permanent bending of the deck surface and resultant ponding of water at the skylight base. While it may be possible to reverse the deck deflection from beneath (via the interstitial space between metal deck and concrete roof deck), spray is required on polyurethane to metal decking atop the existing to provide the required positive slope.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>3. Paragraph 15, Evaluation, is revised to read as follows:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is as supplemented below:<br />This is a best value acquisition using the trade-off approach. The USCG intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price IDIQ Contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government.<br />Selection and award of a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order will be based on, in descending order of importance, 1) Technical Factors, 2) Relevant Past Performance, and 3) Price. Technical Approach and Capability is considered to be more important than Past Performance; however when combined they are significantly more important than price. As the Technical Factors and Relevant Past Performance ratings converge, price may become more important.<br />The USCG will evaluate the offers that meet the requirements of the solicitation against the following evaluation criteria: <br />Factor 1 - Technical Factors: The Government will evaluate each offeror's technical proposal to determine their capacity to meet all the requirements outlined in the specification. The following technical factors apply:<br />1. Experience installing the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator in marine applications. <br />2. Access to or ability to obtain complete technical data for the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator from the manufacturer, Atlas Incinerators A/S; provide documentation of possession of the data or written verification from Atlas Incinerators that states they will make all technical data regarding the Vesta ASWI 204 AS incinerator available for use by the contractor.<br />Factor 2- Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the Statement of Work (i.e. experience servicing the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator; provide a listing of all projects completed servicing the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator). To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant. <br />Factor 3 - Price: The offeror shall propose a fixed price for performing the Incinerator Assessment."</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

The MATOC will be for Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) and Disaster Preparedness (DP) Assessment, Logistics, and Training (ALT) Support Services and Supplies, heretofore referred to as HA/DP ALT, in the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) which includes, but is not limited to, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean for a 12-month base period and two 12-month options. The MATOC will be structured for maximum flexibility in providing for an expedited ordering process in order to satisfy the needs of USSOUTHCOM in the execution of its mission in its AOR. HA/DP ALT contractors will provide support in the following three task areas: <br><br>Task 1 - Assessment: Support the observation, examination, inspection, and analysis of the humanitarian assistance and disaster preparedness of various organizations, their plans, operations, and logistics. Appraise, evaluate and measure various organizations, their plans, operations, and logistics.  The surveillance and assessment will take an overarching approach at all levels and at all agencies, governmental, non-governmental and civil; <br><br>Task 2 - Logistics:  Support TO requirements with the provision of certain logistic items including but not limited to the following types of support - supply operations, field services, and other operations/services; and <br><br>Task 3 - Training:  Support USSOUTHCOM training responsibilities inherent to the HA/DP mission and operations requirements, and compliance with and performance of statutory, regulatory, and doctrine governing and pertaining to the HA/DP mission and operations. This includes all collective training; training readiness; training to established requirements and levels; the process, conduct of training operations and assurance of training to standards to meet HA/DP Operations; the development and execution of plans, programs and efficacy of HA/DP training; and the provisioning and supervision of training and training support to accommodate prescribed HA/DP objectives.  Training support may include risk/safety assessments as needed.  Training may include providing and installing equipment and providing logistics support at host nation training events.  Performance of work will be at various echelons, organizations using various formats including classroom, on-site, on-the-job, and distance learning.   <br><br>The applicable NAICS code is 541614, Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services; with a small business size standard of $14.0 million. This requirement will be solicited on a total small business set-aside basis.<br><br>The nations of Central and South America and the Caribbean have continually experienced a turbulent history of widespread natural disasters. Throughout the region, J4 USSOUTHCOM, in collaboration with local, national, regional, international, governmental and non-governmental organizations, is working to improve recipient nations' disaster response capabilities. This has been accomplished by increasing the capacity and regional infrastructure of recipient nations through support of established regional emergency management mechanisms. A coordinated effort between the U.S. Country Teams and USSOUTHCOM has improved the capacity of recipient nations to respond to humanitarian emergencies and reduce the need for U.S. military assistance. The J4 is responsible for tailoring community development actions in developing countries with a strong emphasis on regions and villages particularly susceptible to natural or man-made disasters. <br><br>HA/DP activities meet two key requirements: maintaining a robust overseas presence aimed at shaping the international security environment in a manner that deters would-be aggressors, strengthens friends and allies, and promoting peace and stability in regions of tension; and, when called upon, assist the victims of natural or manmade disasters. This segment of the program is also tailored to help partner nations, particularly those that have been affected by disaster or hardship, to improve healthcare, education and ensure sustainable community development. The ultimate goal is to build the capacity of community members in order to meet existing and future challenges and mitigate the need for U.S. assistance. <br><br>This solicitation will be issued on or about September 28, 2012 and available to be downloaded from the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.

<p>On 5 Feb 2013, the 11th Wing, Joint Base Andrews, will host the 2013 JB Andrews Small Business Summit at the Jacob E. Smart Center.

Rather than having the traditional vendor booths at this year's summit, we are planning on a combination of presentations and networking/breakout sessions with functional areas from across the installation and the National Capital Region. The afternoon session, which includes lunch, will begin at 12:15PM. <br /><br />***NOTICE TO CONTRACTORS*** Limited space for this event may prohibit the availability of vendor booths/exhibits; therefore, no vendor booths/exhibits are being offered at this time. Any status changes will be published in an amendment to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add include question and answer number 2 as follows NOTE number 1 was regarding the visitation of the vessels and has already been answered:<br /><br />&nbsp;
<p><strong>Question 2/</strong> <strong>Part a.</strong>&nbsp; Had underwater hull cleaning with confirmation by USCG, ever been performed with 90% reclaim of the discharged bio-fouling material? &nbsp;<strong>Part b.</strong>&nbsp; If so, what company has that technology?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Answer 2.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><span>&bull;a.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>MARAD is not aware of any underwater hull cleaning activity in which the USCG has confirmed 90% reclamation of the discharged material.&nbsp; MARAD is unaware that the USCG is confirming any hull reclamation process as this would fall to the individual States and local regulatory agencies to establish the appropriate process and procedures.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><span>&bull;b.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>MARAD is working with the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board to establish a best available process for the underwater hull cleaning of operational Ready Reserve Fleet vessels. The 90% containment threshold is a MARAD requirement, established in the absence of any USCG, State or local regulatory guidance, to be used on MARAD non-retention (non- operational) vessels to establish a best available process for use in not only the MARAD fleet sites but in San Francisco for the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet in lieu of the more costly method of cleaning the vessel hulls while in dry-dock.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; mso-add-space: auto">MARAD has used an underwater hull cleaning process with containment for a number of years.&nbsp; However, the percentage of containment was never quantified until now.</p>

<p>Amendment 03 Posted 07 September 2012 updated proposal submittal instructions in the Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>Amendment 02 posted 29 August 2012 updated proposal preparation instructions.</p>
<p>Amendment 01 posted 29 August 2012 updated contact information for the Broad Agency Announcement.<br />&nbsp;<br />INTRODUCTION:<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack.&nbsp; Please review the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (http://www.defense.gov/bmdr/) for details.&nbsp; The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, directed energy systems, interceptors, and command and control elements to engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from boost and early intercept phases through midcourse into terminal phase.&nbsp; MDA focuses efforts toward making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to counter a broad range of missiles, warheads and trajectories.&nbsp; The BMDS must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>MDA instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant Advanced Technology research and demonstration work at qualified accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.&nbsp; White papers must be for Advanced Research.&nbsp; This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle enabling MDA to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability and filling technology gaps.</p>
<p>MDA issues this BAA under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.&nbsp; Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA meet requirements for full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."</p>
<p>Any activity conducted on or resulting from funding on contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with United States Laws and regulations on "Export Control", including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulation (EAR).&nbsp; All technical documents produced on the contract shall be marked in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5230.24, unless the document is specifically approved by MDA for public release.&nbsp; The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide the appropriate 5230.24 distribution statement.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION:<br />MDA will review information regarding research conducted under MDA funded actions for possible publication or presentation in open or ITAR-controlled forums.&nbsp; Information regarding classified research shall not be published or presented in any unclassified forum.&nbsp; MDA has final authority on publication or release of any information related to research MDA funds, classified or unclassified, in any forum.</p>
<p>Only domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education may submit white papers.&nbsp; Federal educational organizations such as the U.S. military academies must use a different application process; please contact the Contracts Point of Contact (POC) listed below for details regarding Federal educational organizations.&nbsp; If selected for contract award resulting from this BAA, the offeror must be a qualified education institution at time of award.&nbsp; If a white paper is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the white paper must lead the effort and perform more than 50 percent of the effort by cost.</p>
<p>All contract awards are subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability of funds.&nbsp; For planning purposes, firm-fixed-price or cost reimbursement type contracts, cooperative agreements or grants are anticipated to be awarded for these efforts unless otherwise identified.&nbsp; We anticipate each MSTAR contract's funding at a maximum of $500,000 (two year period of performance) or $700,000 (three year period of performance). Funding ceilings are $250,000 a year during a two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000.&nbsp; Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the government.&nbsp; The government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.</p>
<p>MDA requires all lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a white paper under this program hold US citizenship.&nbsp; MDA desires all participating students conducting research for contracts sponsored under this program award to hold US citizenship.&nbsp; In addition, the government reserves the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, including but not limited to individuals that obtain a valid Permanent Resident Card, commonly called a "Green Card", for participation in research for contracts sponsored through this program award. Foreign citizen students without valid Green Cards are ineligible for consideration and participation.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit proposals from offerors having the capability to act as a centralized laboratory to carry out validated quantitative and/or qualitative assays for a variety of compounds in biological specimens collected from preclinical and clinical studies. The data obtained will be used by NIDA to support the development of new medications for the treatment of drug addiction. The laboratory must be able to perform the tasks listed below:
<p>1. Quantitative assay for samples collected from metabolic, pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies:</p>
<p>The laboratory must be able to perform quantitative assays for samples collected from preclinical metabolic and pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies, as well as samples collected from all phases of clinical studies. The analytes include, but are not limited to, potential therapeutic compounds and/their metabolites, abused drugs and/their metabolites, concomitant medications/compounds, and endogenous substances (e.g. proteins, enzymes etc). Sample matrices include biological fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, etc) and tissues (liver, brain, hair etc). The analytical laboratory must be able to develop and validate new assay methods for drugs/metabolites for which established assays do not exist. The analytes may appear in biological matrices at concentrations of low ng/mL or subnanogram/mL and therefore require the use of state of the art analytical methods including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and immunoassays.</p>
<p>2. Assay for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers (protein, enzymes, etc.):</p>
<p>The laboratory must be able to perform assays for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers for the assessment of efficacy and safety of study medications in clinical trials. Monitoring of abused drugs in biological fluids serves as a surrogate outcome measure for assessing drug use in clinical trials. The abused drugs include, but are not limited to, cocaine/benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), methamphetamine, amphetamine, morphine (or morphine-glucuronide), cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines. Automated qualitative/semi-quantitative immunoassays are generally used for screening of abused drugs in biological fluids, primarily in urine. Validated quantitative methods using GC-MS or LC-MS are generally required for confirmatory/quantitative assay for samples which showed positive for screening. Immunoassays are generally required for quantitative assay of molecular biomarkers.</p>
<p>3. Sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices:</p>
<p>The laboratory is required to supply clinical sites with sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices for screening of abused drugs.</p>
<p>The methods for quantitative assays must be validated for reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the concentration ranges required for the preclinical and clinical studies. The laboratory must follow appropriate Food and Drug Administration guidance regarding assay validation and the assay must be carried out in compliance with pertinent current Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The laboratory must have automated equipment for handling sample preparation and injection as well as computer software for data acquisition and report generation. The laboratory must also have sufficient resources to ensure high throughput of samples and must provide secured facilities appropriate for storing biological samples and analytical data as well as computerized systems for tracking samples.</p>
<p>In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that the successful offeror possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Registration for Chemical Analysis or DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V controlled substances and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of a single, five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) task order contract. NIDA may award either cost reimbursement and/or fixed price task orders under this contract. NIDA anticipates that at least one task order will be awarded with the initial contract.</p>
<p>RFP No. N01DA-13-8910 will be available electronically on or about February 5, 2013 [Note: Date change]. You will be able to access the RFP through FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following URL: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps). All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due on or about 45 days after release of the RFP. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to replace the Statement of Work attachment provided in the pre-solicitation notice previously posted on 25 January 2013.

This purpose of this announcement is to release a pre-solicitation notice in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 5.204. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to conduct a full and open competition and release solicitation N00024-13-R-4304 for the accomplishment of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) Class Planning Yard services in the first quarter of calendar year 2013.  The LCS Planning Yard services include but are not limited to the following types of Class Support: Fleet Modernization Program planning; ship change planning, development and installation; Operating Cycle Integration Program Management; work integration package engineering; Ship Configuration Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) support and Configuration Data Management (CDM); research engineering and modeling; Provisioned Items Order and other Integrated Planning Yard (IPY) Material Support; technical documentation maintenance and updates, including Engineering Operational Sequencing System and Combat System Operational Sequencing System (EOSS and CSOSS); NSEDR system input and data management; interface and coordination with Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs); managing related class Ship Selected Record Document (SSRD) and Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) engineering standardization efforts; and Preventative and Planned Maintenance System (PMS) item development and scheduling.
 Unique to this Planning Yard is the requirement for the Contractor to manage the scheduling of all planned, continuous, and emergent maintenance, and associated availabilities (for example, CMAVs, PMAVs, and WOOs). This responsibility includes the requirement to integrate work completion by multiple, likely simultaneous, private and public organizations.  Contract award is projected to be made in the first quarter of calendar year January 2014 and continue for a period of performance of five years: one year plus four one-year options.

No telephone or email inquiries will be accepted regarding this notice and attachment, and requests for solicitation packages will not be granted, as a solicitation has not been prepared at this time.

Future information, if any, will be posted at the websites for FBO (https://www.fbo.gov/) and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/), the same sites where this announcement is posted.

Notice regarding solicitation:  Please note that this synopsis is for information purposes and to provide an updated Statement of Work document.
  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government of any kind.

1) ETRS DRAFT SOW (Please note that this is in draft format and is subject to change)
2) ETRS Industry Day Agenda

____________________________________________________________

All interested parties are invited to participate in an Engineering and Technical Related Services (ETRS) Industry Day to be held on 12 February 2013 from 9:30 am to 1:00pm at The Cannon Gate Conference Center at Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, NJ (07806-5000).  Government attendees will include representatives from the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Divisions (NSWC IHD) - Picatinny Detachment, Systems Integration Department and the NSWC IHD Procurement Office.
  

This acquisition is anticipated to provide services in direct support of the NSWC IHD Picatinny Detachments primary mission of providing In-Service Support to Major, Medium and Minor Caliber Gun Systems operated by the US Navy.  The objective of this event is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future procurement of the ETRS requirement.  The ETRS requirement will provide engineering and technical related support services in the following key areas: 1) Weapon Systems Engineering, Technology, Engineering and Logistics, 2) Technical Systems Engineering Analysis and Basic Engineering Studies of Weapon Systems and Performance, 3)Engineering Studies Necessary to support new concepts, designs, and programs to support acquisition life cycle,  4) Technical Services such as technical documents, drafting, illustrations, etc., 5) Development and Execution of overall contract and management plan to include metrics measuring contractor performance against proposal expectations, 6) Furnishing data item deliverables, as well as performance management plan and surveillance tools for the government to use in monitoring the contract.
  

Following this Industry Day, it is envisioned that a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued for the ETRS requirement.  The contracting approach will involve the issue of an RFP followed by proposal submission by all interested vendors.  This will ultimately lead to a contract award.  

After an evaluation involving NSWC IHD Picatinny Detachment Systems Integration Department personnel, one proposal will be selected for further acquisition. Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate refinement of the competitive acquisition strategy.

<a href="mailto:young.gerold@epa.gov">young.gerold@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>***Pre-Solicitation Amendment*** The purpose of this amendment is to change from an intent to sole source to full and open competition.  The procurement authority has also changed from FAR Part 15 to Far Parts 12 and 13.  The solicitation will be posted on or about February 8, 2013 to the EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. ***End of Amendment***
The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Horiba Instruments, Inc. to provide an upgraded Horiba light duty chassis system Constant Volume Sampler for the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. 
The Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD) light duty test cell A005 is being rebuilt with a new four wheel drive chassis dynamometer.  The gas sampling equipment that was removed before construction is aging and many components are not available for replacement when problems arise.  Components of the Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) are not suitable to be upgraded to current testing criteria.  The EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Michigan utilizes the CVS system as a means for test sequencing, control, and exhaust sampling.     This upgrade shall replace aging CVS equipment currently at the EPA Facility that is capable of running vehicle tests under the requirements of the proposed amendments of 40 CFR part 1066.  The aging system currently only has a single sample path and pump with a motor controlled butterfly valve to control tail pipe back pressure.  

The CVS system upgrade will provide dilution of emissions via a common dilution tunnel six inches in diameter for both gasoline and diesel powered vehicles.  The system must be capable of sampling both bag and dilute continuous exhaust samples from both gasoline and diesel catalyst equipped vehicles.  The system will be made capable of raw gas sampling and ready for future installation of a compatible raw analysis bench including CDTCS integration.  The CVS equipment should be compatible with an existing dynamometer with current video driver?s aid and existing benches to assure test control and functionality.  For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, warranty, and training of EPA staff.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement trace ability and system acceptanc e in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 17025 standards.
 This procurement will be accomplished unsing FAR Part 15 Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Gerold Young II by e-mail to young.gerold@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>Request For Information   <br>      <br>   Program Title:  Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS)   <br>      <br>   Introduction:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) has a requirement to procure equipment for the Life Cycle Replacement of the current Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS) located at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California.     <br>      <br>      <br>   Acquisition Strategy Planning Information (Draft):   <br>      <br>   Contract Vehicle:  TBD    <br>   Contract Type:  FFP - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable   <br>      <br>   Acquisition Time Estimates:    <br>    	Sources Sought Release Feb 2013   <br>    	RFP Release March 2013   <br>    	Contract Award June 2013   <br>      <br>      <br>   Requirement:  Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) has a requirement to procure equipment for the Life Cycle Replacement of the current Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS) located at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California.  These efforts include the procurement and installation of the hardware and software components to provide continuous monitoring of the electromagnetic spectrum in the frequency range of 20MHz to 40GHz and direction finding of basic electromagnetic radiation parameters in the frequency range of 20MHz to 18.5GHz.  The SMECS will consist of two fixed locations and one mobile system for detection and direction finding.  The two fixed systems will be located remotely on Tiefort and Granite Mountains and will be controlled from the SMECS monitoring station to be located in the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  The mobile portion of the SMECS hardware will be installed in the NTC G6 HMMWV (V-30B) communications shelter.  In addition, it is anticipated that delivery of initial spares, New Equipment Training (NET), and integration/testing support will be necessary.  <br>      <br>   Background Information:   <br>      <br>   Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS):   <br>   SMECS is a subsystem of the National Training Center - Instrumentation System (NTC-IS).  The SMECS is a stand-alone system.  SMECS provides the means to monitor, measure, and record all relevant NTC electromagnetic emissions that may interfere with the NTC or regional area surrounding Fort Irwin, CA.  It has the capability to track signal sources via fixed site and mobile direction finding.  The SMECS is comprised of two components, a Real Time Monitoring Frequency (RTMF) component and a Direction Finding (DF) component.     <br>      <br>   Real Time Monitoring Frequency (RTMF) Component:   <br>   The RTMF component equipment is located at two fixed sites, Tiefort and Granite Mountains and controlled from the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  Data and control functions for the RTMF are provided via the Range Monitoring and Control Subsystem (RMCS) fiber-optic component.  The RTMF provides a real-time monitoring function to assess the battlefield spectrum during exercises and supports regional frequency management monitoring and control functions. The RTMF component of SMECS continuously monitors the electromagnetic spectrum over a frequency range from 20 MHz to 40 GHz.     <br>      <br>   Direction Finding (DF) Component:   <br>   The DF component provides the capability to continuously monitor electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 20 MHz to 1 GHz, and upon operator selection, accurately display the line of bearing to the source of any signal of interest.  The DF component consists of three discrete components: a free ranging mobile DF, mounted on the NTC G6 HMMWV, and two functionally identical fixed sites located on Tiefort and Granite Mountains, which are remotely controlled from the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  These sites send and receive data and commands via the RMCS fiber-optic component.   <br>      <br>   Follow-on Industry Meetings:  The Government intends to release a draft set of technical documents and draft acquisition strategy information under a Sources Sought release in Feb 2013.  The Government does not plan to conduct an Industry day for this effort.     <br>      <br>   RFI:  As a part of Market Research, the project team requests interested Prime contractors provide a no more than 5 page product summary of existing fielded capabilities currently in use in a military/Government operational/training environment supporting the same or similar requirements.  Responses must include evidence of being capable of meeting a 12 month after contract award delivery schedule with no development funding provided and please state the feasibility of fielding in 6 months.  The Government would also like to know whether the Prime contractor is an awarded STOC II contractor and their designated under Lot I or Lot II.  Should you be a Small Business that is expecting to be prime contractors for this effort please state how you will meet the limitations on subcontracting as set forth in FAR 52.219-14.     <br>      <br>   POC:  Technical questions should be directed to Frank Lumley, Project Director, Frank.Lumley1@us.army.mil.  Interested parties should provide their RFI response via email to Christopher Camp, Contract Specialist, Christopher.J.Camp@us.army.mil.  Provide your response NLT 2:00pm, February 8, 2013.   <br>      <br>   Disclaimer:  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.

<DESC>Construction of Fish Passage Facility ($32 M) sources sought announcements:
<p>This same announcement is also being advertised under NAICS 236220 and 562910&nbsp;Sources Sought announcement numbers W912HN-13-Z-0003-01 and W912HN-13-Z-0003-02.</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the government in any contract award. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District is issuing this Sources Sought announcement for the construction of a Fish Passage Facility to determine interest, availability and capability of business to perform the work as described below. The New Savannah Bluff Lock &amp; Dam (NSBL&amp;D) is located on the Savannah River at River Mile 187.4, approximately 13 miles downstream from the City of Augusta, Georgia. This facility is the most downstream lock and dam along the Savannah River and is authorized for the purpose of improving the commercial navigation channel between the upper limits of the Savannah Harbor and the head of navigation at Augusta, Georgia. It was constructed by the Corps and was completed in 1937.</p>
<p>The dam structure is 360 ft long and contains five vertical spillway gates. The lock is located along the right abutment (Georgia Side) and measures approximately 56 ft wide and 360 ft long, with a maximum lift height of approximately 15 ft. The facility provides ponding upstream to support several water intakes and recreation for the City's of Augusta, GA and North Augusta, SC. The fish passage is designed to allow Shortnose sturgeon, a federally listed endangered species, as well as several other species including Atlantic sturgeon, shad and robust redhorse, access to shoals upstream of the dam where their historic spawning habitat is located.</p>
<p>The fish passage would be constructed adjacent to the dam on existing high ground on the South Carolina bank of the river. Preliminary hydraulic modeling efforts estimate the structure to be approximately 250 feet wide and 2000 feet long. The work to be conducted includes access road construction, clearing and grubbing approximately 18 acres, excavation and grading of up to 300,000 cy of material, and placement of approximately 20,000 tons of bedding stone, 88,000 tons of armor stone, and 8,800 tons of tons of weir stone to construct the fish passage facility. The weir stones will require specific placement locations to provide for successful fish passage. Two existing overflow gates in the dam structure will modified. Modification of the gates will require dewatering in the immediate area of the gates.</p>
<p>No in-water work will be allowed downstream of the dam during the period between February 1 and May 31. Care must be taken at all times to prevent interference with migrating species. Construction must be done in a manner so as not to interfere with operation of the dam and lock or damage of the existing structure.</p>
<p>All interested firms with 237990, 236220, 562910&nbsp;and any other related NAICS codes have until 07 February 2013 at 2:00pm to submit the following information:</p>

<DESC>The following are responses to questions asked in connection with Request For Information (RFI) VA118-13-I-0075, T-16 Health Management Platform (hi2) Usability Analytics Task 2 Market Research for Requirements Development. 


1.	Is there a page limit for the response to the Sources Sought notice?

Response: There is no page limit however responses should be limited to a total file size of 5MB or less, and identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response to this RFI.

2.	A key functional specification specified in the RFI included "interoperability with the HMP application stack (e.g., Data Access Layer, Virtual Patient Record, Business Logic, and User Interfaces) and data model."   Will the primary scope of this effort encompass the VistA/CPRS instanced, deployed in over 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities.

Response: The VA's goal is to develop the HMP as a successor to the existing CPRS GUI (graphical user interface). HMP GUI will continue to use VistA as the underlying database. 

3.	Can you provide examples of current tools and software already implemented in the UAP?

Response: UAP is not supported by existing VistA/CPRS.

4.	Another functional specification specified in the RFI included "support plug-ins and for 3rd party solutions".  Can you provide examples of such software categories? 

Response: We foresee a need to allow plug-ins and third party solutions to add functionality to UAP. For instance a third party tool such as eye tracking system could be integrated within UAP via a plug-in. Another example would be third party analytic tools for visualization and presentation of UAP data to stakeholders.

5.	Are Pharmacists included within the health-care system facing outward component of the HMP? 

Response: Yes, pharmacists will be users of HMP.

6.	Are their special security considerations and safeguards that VA has already contemplated in respect to this initiative?   

Response: There are no special security considerations. However all software will have to meet existing federal data security and privacy requirements and comply with VA  Directive 6500, Information Security Program dated September 20, 2012. This directive provides the specific procedures and operational requirements to ensure Department-wide compliance with a policy that is consistent with VA's information security statutes, 38 United States Code (U.S.C)  5722-5727; the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C  3541-3549; and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources. This Directive, in concert with VA Handbook 6500, establishes VA policy and responsibilities for incorporating National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach; SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View; and SP-800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, requirements into VA's information system environment to ensure appropriate security for VA information technology assets that store, process, or transmit VA information. 

7.	What data retention and backup policies need to be adhered to?

Response: This data will need to be stored within the VA firewall and comply with appropriate VA retention and back-up policies. 

8.	Could you provide the compliance standards the VA is required to adhere to?

Response: Please refer to the following URL for the public facing VA guidance for software: http://www.voa.va.gov

9.	General Information Line 136: HMP will be accessed through a variety of platforms, including tablet devices, smart phones, and traditional PCs. Will medical devices (non-tablet, smart-phones, and traditional PCs) need to access the HMP?

Response: No

10.	The scope of the effort states that the enterprise architecture should support up to "150+ facilities and 300,000 users". Does this user group include Veterans and their family member receiving care?

Response: Yes, it is foreseeable that users may include patients and caregivers who will access HMP via various devices (e.g. tablets, smart-phones, computer kiosks).

11.	Is there a timeline or expected date of release for the related RFP?

Response: Not at this time.
?
 
12.	Has a budget for the RFP been allocated? If so, will the VA share that information? 

Response: At this time there is no budget determination.

13.	Will this initiative progress in phases, or will it be one large project?
If it will be in phases, what are the VA's plans for dividing this effort into phases 
such as gap analysis, future state definition, build out of foundational
architecture, and implementation of functionalities?

Response: The UAP initiative is part of the larger hi2 initiative and will progress in phases. The gap analysis and market research for UAP are already underway as part of an existing contract with VA CASE (Center for Applied System Engineering). UAP foundational architecture and implementation of functionalities will be future phases and will be determined based on vendor responses to this RFI.

14.	Will Eatontown, NJ, be the primary place of performance should an
RFP be released?

Response: No. HMP development activities are centered in Salt Lake City, UT. 

15.	Is there a possibility of the RFP being an SBA 8(a) competitive bid, small business set aside or other type of set aside or will this be a full and open competition?

Response: At this time there has been no determination

16.	Can the VA provide information about the current IT systems-for
example, the number of systems, the predominant technologies used, key vendor applications implemented, and the number of IT staff members and their roles (developers, testers, architects, database programmers, DBAs, etc.)?

Response: This information was provided in the RFI: "The HMP platform consists of service orientated architecture that comprises three main abstraction layers.  The HMP is implemented in Java and utilizes current technologies such as restful services and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), to implement next generation modular interfaces that are customizable to the user's needs.  Central to the HMP architecture is a design allowing for collaborative development, allowing for development partners to add additional functionality or modules to the Health Management Platform." Please refer back to the RFI.

17.	Is there any current-state technology or capability document that
the VA can share that will provide some insight (at a high level) of present
capabilities? 

Response: These are internal documents that will be considered for sharing for those who participate if an RFP is issued. 

18.	Is there an ongoing project for this initiative or will this be a new initiative?

Response: The UAP project is part of the VA's ongoing Health Management Platform (HMP) project. The HMP is a key project of VHA's Health Informatics Initiative (hi2).

19.	What software products are currently used to collect usability data and for reporting/analysis of the data? (Reference lines 70 - 76 of the RFI)? 

Response: The VA's existing EMR does not have integrated software tools that allow the collection of user interactions needed to study usability. As a result various off the shelf standalone software tools that allow screen scraping and manual coding of interactions is required. Obviously this approach does not scale up and is very labor intense. 

20.	What data is currently collected, both by the software tools and manually?

Response: There are researchers in the VA who are using screen scraping software and manual coding of user interactions such as mouse clickstreams to study EMR usability in experimental settings only. These usability studies are useful for identifying in-efficiencies such as the need to constantly switch screens to hunt for information or the use of extensive drop down menus in order to complete one clinical task.

21.	What is the anticipated size or growth rate of the data for the UAP ?

Response: The anticipated size of data that can be collected is extremely large given that thousands of users interact with the EMR on daily basis. For instance in one small VA study EMR usage data was collected from approximately 100 office visits resulted in over 20,000 mouse clicks that can be associated to specific tasks. From an analytic perspective there is an opportunity to capture a lot of data (certainly in the realm of Big Data) yet not every interaction needs to be analyzed and reviewed. Rather our intent is to enable us to monitor selected interactions based on identified needs. 

22.	The RFI states 300,000 users and real-time like access. What is the concurrency of access? 

Response: The VA has approximately 300,000 users of its clinical EMR. Some users like physicians or nurses are daily users of the EMR and others such as administrators probably use the system sporadically. While there is no reliable estimate on concurrency of EMR access we do know that the usability analytic platform may not need to log all user interactions for all 300,000 users.   Sampling of specific users and their interactions can be used to profile overall system usability. 

23.	Does VA intend to procure software tools or technology if there is a resulting RFP/RTEP; or, is the program scope only for consulting and advisory services?

Response: Yes the VA does intend to procure software tools or technology if there is a resulting RFP/RTEP.

24.	The RFI states "This RFI focuses on steps that precede actual development or procurement, paying particular attention to needs for integrative technologies." Will the effort scoped in the eventual RFP do likewise? To what extent should provisions be made for implementation (i.e., coding) of the UAP above and beyond its conceptualization and design?

Response: We definitely encourage vendors to emphasize software development, databases, and analytics expertise as part of the response to the RFI. At the RFI phase vendors should focus on conceptualization and design. Implementation will be the focus of future RFP.

25.	What contractors are already engaged by the VA for work relating to the HMP? Are they eligible to compete for the present work on the UAP?

Response: Multiple contractors are working on various aspects of the HMP. They are not precluded from competing should an RFP be issued. 


26.	Are there any contractors who have already done work related to conceptualizing the UAP? If so, who? Are they eligible to compete for the UAP work that would be solicited in an eventual RFP?

Response:  They would not be precluded from competing should an RFP be issued.

27.	Is it anticipated that the HMP will directly interface with medical devices, or will the results of patient monitoring be abstracted in some way and entered into the HMP in the form of derived measures?

Response: This is not in the current scope of work. The possibility exists that medical devices may be considered in the future.

28.	Will the HMP include provisions for management of patient billing or other financial management systems, ordering supplies, or staffing of VA facilities?

Response: This is not in the current scope of work. The possibility exists that these will be considered in the future.

29.	In the guidance for responding to this RFI, it states "Provide a brief summary of your technical approach to meet the requirements. Address each of the six sections above." Are we correct that this is referring to the six numbered items on page 4, under "The scope of this effort is to provide information regarding:"?

Response: Yes that is correct.

30.	Is there a description of the platform and architecture details for their HMP systems, published interfaces, and comprehensive list of software used in the platform and environment that can be shared?
	
Response: There are current-state technology or capability documents, but they are internal documents that will be considered for sharing for those who participate in the RFP. Per the RFI: ""The HMP platform consists of service orientated architecture that comprises three main abstraction layers.  The HMP is implemented in Java and utilizes current technologies such as restful services and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), to implement next generation modular interfaces that are customizable to the user's needs.  Central to the HMP architecture is a design allowing for collaborative development, allowing for development partners to add additional functionality or modules to the Health Management Platform." Please refer back to the RFI.

31.	Could a list of supported devices be shared?

Response: HMP will be device agnostic and compatible with any device (desktop or laptop computers, tablets, smartphones) running modern web browser.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under the statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Stuewe &amp; Sons, Inc.
<p>The requirements for the styroblocks are as follows:</p>
<p>Need to purchase 6,851 blocks of the Ventblock 20, 45/340 and 4,522 blocks of the Ventblock 10, 77/170. The Ventblock containers, which are expandable polystyrene (EPS) stryofoam growing containers, are to be brand name or equal with salient characteristics to Beaver Plastics Ventblock, block model 45/340 and 77/170. The containers must be made of Ventblock foam to insulate the root plug from extreme cold and warm temperature fluctuations. The containers must be rectangular in shape with nominal measurements of 23.6" x 13.8" (60 cm x 35 cm) to accommodate the approximately 61,400 square feet of bench top framework at the the Placerville Nursery. The Ventblock 20 must provide 45 cavities per block. Each Ventblock 20 cavity shall have a volume of 20.5 cu in. and must be 6.0" in depth and have a top diameter of 2.4". The Ventblock 10 must provide 77 cavities per block. Each Ventblock 10 cavity shall have a volume of 10 cu. in. and must be 6.0" in depth and have a top diameter of 1.7". <br />Each cavity must have ridges to prevent root spiraling and will have a hole at the bottom large enough to allow moisture and root egress, but not so large that growing media can escape while filling and in use. The top and bottom surface of the blocks must be flat without legs or protrusions that would prevent the containers from traveling under the sowing and extraction equipment at the nursery. The containers must be white to reflect shortwave radiation and emit less longwave (heat) radiation to prevent stressing seedling foliage. The EPS will have added ultraviolet light blockers to allow the containers to be used for at least 3 years (crops) in full sun.</p>

However, The Government will consider all capability statements, addressing the specifications above, received by &not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;4:30 pm, Thursday February 14, 2013.
