<CONTACT>Debra M. Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     Debra.Bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.  Details on the MMS Sand and Gravel Program can be found on the internet at http://www.mms.gov/sandandgravel/.  The State of Louisiana is looking to MMS to provide access to Federal sand offshore Louisiana for planned barrier island and coastal restoration efforts.  Material on the OCS represents a prime,  compatible source of sand in the volumes required for these efforts. The initial projects to require the use of Federal sand from Ship Shoal, a topographic feature located offshore central Louisiana, may well require the removal of more than 14 million yd3 of OCS sand resources.  The process involved in the removal of seabed material and subsequent transport and placement of material on the beach or coastal area is called dredging and normally employs hydraulic dredges almost exclusively (either cutterhead or hopper-type dredges).  Regardless of the dredging method employed, the process removes material and creates a depression in the seafloor.  Numerous oil and gas pipelines are present on Ship Shoal in the vicinity of the possible borrow areas. In addition to pipelines, there are platforms, wellheads, and other oil and gas-related infrastructure present.  This is true not only on Ship Shoal, but throughout the central Gulf of Mexico, in areas which also represent potential future sources of sand for coastal restoration efforts. MMS projects the possible use of 20 to 30 million cubic yards or more of Federal sand offshore Louisiana within the next 5 to 10 years. Given the potential of removing 3 or more meters of sediment in an area near oil and gas-related infrastructure, there exists the issue of sea floor stability and the potential for seafloor topographic changes that may affect platforms and pipelines.  To limit the effect on platforms, pipelines, or other structures, dredging must be limited to areas that are not likely to alter platform strength or result in pipeline spanning.  Objective of the Study:  The objective of the proposed study is to address the issue of seafloor stability and the impact on pipelines and other oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of projected dredging activities and the potential removal of large volumes of sand from Ship Shoal and other areas offshore Louisiana.  The prospective offeror will be asked to assemble a scientific/ technical team and formulate a work plan to address the following questions:  *	How much material can be removed before the surficial integrity on Ship Shoal and other potential borrow areas offshore Louisiana in the vicinity of oil and gas infrastructure are impacted such that the surface collapses and the structural integrity of pipelines or platforms are compromised, especially during storm events such as hurricanes?  A three-year physical field study conducted by Dr. Gregory Stone of Louisiana State University for MMS concluded that sediment transport and surficial sediment movement is quite intense on Ship Shoal during these storm events. The Offeror should take into account the results of this effort and evaluate fully the potential for sediment instability during storm events.  *Exactly how much of a buffer or avoidance zone should be established around these features to avoid such a compromise? Should different buffer or avoidance zones be developed for different infrastructures?  It is expected that the work effort will take a total of approximately 12 months and will involve some form of computer modeling coupled with an analysis of soil stability offshore Louisiana.  The cost of this effort is Not to Exceed $110,000.  Work products will include a Draft and Final Technical Report.  In order to compete for this contract, an Offeror must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00 p.m. on February 18, 2004, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:(A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years.  Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and four (4) copies to  Debra Bridge, Contract Specialist, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817. Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia. Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on: (A) Experience and expertise of all technical key personnel. Particularly relevant is their expertise in the field of dredging technology and engineering or other relevant necessary disciplines to undertake the project, their experience in the type of work proposed, and demonstrated ability to do the work. Scientific personnel must collectively demonstrate relevant experience in the appropriate disciplines. Assessment factors will be their qualifications, the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort; the technical personnel who will be responsible for the organization of information and the production of documents and manuscripts will also be evaluated. Evaluation factors include 1. The length and quality of experience for each person assigned to perform specific tasks, 2. The level and quality of formal education in the disciplines and technical fields necessary, examining the level of relevant education attained, as well as honors, awards, and recognition of previous work. 3. Experience with similar programs and studies. (B) The Project Manager shall have: (1) experience and demonstrated leadership ability required for the coordination of the study process, and (2) ability to control costs and to keep project performance and document preparation on schedule; and (C)Your organization's history of (1) successful completion of similar projects (similar in size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value), (2) producing high-quality documents, and (3) conducting similar projects on schedule and within budget.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center Range Instrumentation System Program Office (AAC/YBR), plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 31 Jan 2004, for an Enhanced Range Applications Program (EnRAP).  Potential offerors should monitor the website (www.fedbizopps.gov) for the official release of the RFP package.  This announcement serves as the Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).  This will be an unrestricted competition and award will be based on a Best Value procurement.  Even though cost is a significant factor, award may not go to the lowest offeror.  EnRAP will provide a significant improvement to Test and Evaluation (T&E) instrumentation capabilities desperately needed by Army, Navy, and Air Force test ranges to meet Department of Defense (DoD) responsibilities for comprehensive testing of emerging combat systems. Development will be accomplished under the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), with production under the same contract funded by the individual Services. EnRAP will provide a phased-in replacement for the Advanced Range Data System (ARDS) participant instrumentation packages and ground instrumentation currently in use on the T&E ranges. EnRAP systems development will improve the T&E range technical performance for vehicle tracking and data transmission and significantly improve participant package flexibility, miniaturization, modularity, and standardization. The participant package development will provide miniaturized modular instrumentation packages for internal mounting in high dynamic vehicles, instrumentation pods for external mounting on aircraft wing stations, and an EnRAP Aircraft Instrumentation Subsystem Internal (EAISI) package for the F-18 and AV-8B aircraft. The participant package software and hardware can quickly and economically be reprogrammed, upgraded, and modified to meet continually evolving operational mission requirements. EnRAP system improvements over the current ARDS capability will include (1) a significant enhancement of datalink capabilities in both throughput and flexibility including Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) compliant technology, (2) a significant increase in the accuracy and data update rates for position, velocity, acceleration and attitude data, (3) a miniaturization of the participant packages, (4) the implementation of standardized interface protocols and an open architecture design, and (5) a replacement of the encryption subsystem with state-of-the-art encryption technology, all in accordance with (IAW) performance capabilities documented in the EnRAP System Requirements Document (SRD). The most challenging datalink improvement will be to meet the requirement for increased EnRAP data throughput within the frequency bandwidths currently used by ARDS, and if possible to further reduce the bandwidth required for these additional data. Datalink parameters will be programmable and selectable for each mission and flexibility will be added within missions to make real-time changes. Maximum flexibility will be built into the system to change the number of participants in the network automatically, customize message content, determine message length and format, vary the data collection/update rates, control uplink and downlink intervals, select radiated power to some degree (low and high power datalink version), allow for participant-to-participant communication and provide a message relay capability. The datalink throughput baseline will support at a minimum 25 participants at 40 messages per second, using data messages that contain at least 1200 bits of usable information per message through one relay. The system will support T&E range test operations with encrypted and unencrypted participants and variable data rates and will accommodate real-time changes to the number of participants in the network and changes to other system parameters. Up to three relays (four hops) will be possible to extend range coverage. It will be possible to concatenate available time slots to support transmission of messages longer than the standard 1200 information bits. The datalink transceiver will operate in both a high power and a low power mode. The basic high power datalink transceiver mode will support air-to-ground communications to at least 130 nautical miles (nmi) (160 nmi objective) and an air-to-air communications to at least 100 nmi (120 nmi objective). A low power transceiver mode will support a 40 nmi air-to-air range and a 50 nmi air-to-ground range.  Message reliability will be 90 percent for participant-to-participant datalink transceiver transmissions and for communications with one ground station, and reliability will be 95 percent for communications with two ground stations in line-of-sight to the transceiver. It will be possible to organize selected participant packages into at least four separate missions, with each using different security levels and different encryption keys. The EnRAP datalink transceiver will operate in the 1350-1450 megahertz (MHz) band using plug-and-play datalink modules. An objective is for the datalink transceiver to be tunable to include the 1750-1850 MHz band if possible.  EnRAP will coexist with the Multi-Service Target Control system (MSTCS) datalink ground and airborne systems in the 1350-1450 MHz band without harmful or destructive interference. An extended range control capability will be developed for EnRAP to make it possible for any T&E range to have complete control of all aspects of selected ground stations at another T&E range. Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking accuracy will be improved by at least one order-of-magnitude (10 times) for position and several orders of magnitude for velocity, acceleration and attitude compared to ARDS. To conserve cost, instrumentation with three levels of accuracy will be developed under EnRAP and made available for the range users. The lowest-cost and lowest accuracy units will be used on low-dynamic participants (Level I). The moderate-cost units will be used for high-dynamic testing that does not require extreme accuracy (Level II). Level II instrumentation will be developed in both an internal mount configuration and a pod configuration. The highly accurate, highest-cost units (Level III) will be used on high-dynamic participants when the highest level of accuracy is required and will be an internal mount configuration only. Level III real time/post-mission position accuracy will be 0.3 meter/ 0.1 meter with real time/post mission velocity accuracies of 0.006 meters/second (m/s) and 0.002 m/s. Level II and III participant instrumentation will have some resistance to performance degradation due to GPS jamming. Interfaces will be standardized using commercial standards to the maximum extent possible. Participant internal interfaces will include both RS 422 and IEEE 1394b. Ground instrumentation will be interfaced using Ethernet. Participant instrumentation will have the capability to interface to aircraft MIL-STD-1553 data buses and the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) embedded training IEEE 1394. The EnRAP ground system design will incorporate a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)-compliant interface to the existing host range infrastructure. Participant instrumentation will include data recorders that have removable recording media with capacities of at least 10 gigabytes (GB) with an objective of 50 GB. Participant instrumentation will be modular to allow easy reconfiguration to meet evolving T&E mission requirements and customer needs. The datalink system uplink and downlink transmissions will be able to be encrypted with a Next Generation Encryption Device (NGED). The data recorded in the participant can be unencrypted or encrypted using the NGED. The NGED will be developed by the EnRAP contractor and the EnRAP participant and ground systems will be designed to meet National Security Agency (NSA) standards for red and black separation for data encryption up to TOP SECRET. Participant packages will be designed to operate both with and without the NGED installed. EnRAP participant packages and datalink ground station equipment will be designed such that they can be set to operate in an unencrypted mode while the NGED is installed.  The Government has established a non-classified technical library on the ATIMS website (http://ATIMS.hill.af.mil). ATIMS requires Internet Explorer or Netscape version 4.0 or higher. To register, click on [Register for ATIMS] while in the website (http://ATIMS.hill.af.mil).  This registration form must be completed in its entirety.

<DESC>An RFP will be issued on or about 23 Jan 04, the RFP is for an enterprise-wide Telecommunications Management System (TMS) Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product. This TMS architecture is to satisfy the requirements of the MAJCOMs and to standardize TMS Air Force Wide.

Government telephone systems are changing constantly. The purpose of implementing TMS is to provide overall telecom management, not just a record-keeping device. The TMS is envisioned to meet the future demands of the evolving Government telephone system by providing a centralized, scalable, and automated computer based management system that is modular in design while integrating all data into an inter-relational structure.

The TMS, when fully deployed, will provide the capability to proactively and reactively manage the Air Force voice networks at the Network Control Center (NCC) level and the Network Operations and Security Center (NOSC) level. Each Base NCC has the capability to manage their own network as far as administration (moves, additions, changes, analysis) and maintenance (trouble reporting, help desk, testing) are concerned. The MAJCOM NOSC will have the capability to centrally manage the voice network through fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management. The NOSC will then report up to a central AF analysis location by presenting performance and configuration data for any base switch in the Enterprise.

Response date – 02 FEB 04N00164-04-R-6638	Description – Supply Chain and Logistics Management FSG – R	NAICS - 541614 The Navy requires implementation of the Rapid Mobilization of Manufacturing Sources Program (RMMSP), which will develop and test with New England Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) an approach to rapidly profile and record the product capabilities and capacities of such SMEs. This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis with a non-profit organization - Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership (Maine MEP), Augusta, Maine 04330-5509, based on FAR 6.302-1; ‘Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements’. This effort will allow Maine MEP to assess the capabilities of SMEs to be Department of D efense (DoD) suppliers.  Maine MEP will also deliver technical assistance, conduct training and mentoring solutions, increase SME capabilities, and assist SMEs through teaming arrangements to respond to specific DoD procurement opportunities. Maine MEP has a unique combination of experience and qualifications directly related to the RMMSP, including expertise in the state-of-the-art for linking demand for low volume parts, surge demands and diminishing manufacturing sources and material sources (DMSMS) with available manufacturing capacity on an on-demand basis.   Moreover, Maine MEP has developed the application platform that is integral to the success of collecting and managing SME capability and capacity information that is essential to the core objectives of the RMMSP. As the managing agent for numerous MEP centers in the New England states, Maine MEP has extensive experien ce in the nationwide MEP program, a program sponsored by the National Institute of Standards (NIST) that is designed to help SMEs enhance their manufacturing competitiveness. This will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract covering a 2-year ordering period. A letter RFP will be issued to Maine MEP only. Interested persons may submit inquiries within 45 days of the release of this synopsis (See Note 22).

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is announcing opportunities to participate in Earth Science Enterprise core research activities related to ocean and ice. Specifically, the Announcement (NRA-04-OES-02) seeks proposals for scientific investigations and research activities contributing to the continuation and enhancement of NASA's Physical and Biological Oceanography Programs and the Cryospheric Sciences Program.  In particular, this announcement seeks innovative investigations that utilize NASA's observational data for investigations of ocean, ice, and climate processes.  It also seeks proposals that utilize this knowledge in facilitating the development and evaluation of models and data assimilation systems that include representations of the oceanic and cryospheric aspects of the Earth's climate system. The ESE has recently released an NRA for Carbon Cycle Science research that provides opportunities for complementary investigations that utilize remote sensing data to understand regional and global carbon cycling within the Earth System.  Interested  investigators should read both announcements carefully for direction on the best place to submit proposals that touch on aspects of the oceanic carbon cycle. Total funds available for work selected under this NRA in Ocean and Ice are approximately $16M over three years.  While there are no specific requirements for proposal budgets we do not expect budgets to exceed $250,000 per year, and in most cases are expected to be less. The complete NRA will be available electronically on February 3, 2004, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities Web Page at  http://research.nasa.gov  under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)". A paper copy will be available to those who do not have access to Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message.  Notice of Intent is due March 4, 2004. This announcement will be open through May 4, 2004, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout this period.

Pre-qualification No. PPD-SRA-0001a
Conceptual Design Services - Nevada Rail and Transportation
Yucca Mountain Project
Due Date: February 02, 2004, 4:00p.m. PST



INTRODUCTION:

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) and to subsequently award a Conceptual Design Services Subcontract for Nevada Rail and Transportation. It is BSC's intent to award a single subcontract for the services. However, BSC reserves the right to award multiple subcontracts if it is determined to be in the best interest of BSC, and the government, to cover the scope of services required. The RFP will be made available only to pre-qualified firms or teams. 

To potentially achieve pre-qualification and receive a RFP, respondents must submit: 1) a completed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) or equivalent, and 2) a completed FAR Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) or equivalent. Item 1) should be submitted for the lead firm (or for each lead firm if a joint venture) and for each consulting firm or independent associate on the team. Item 2) should be a single submittal on behalf of the entire team. Item 2) should provide respondent's approach to the project including, on a team basis, project personnel by discipline; outside consultants or associates; brief resumes of key personnel including the senior technical manager and key technical personnel; work experience (last 5 years) by team firm members which best illustrates qualifications relevant to the project; work being currently performed by the lead firm or joint venture members directly for Federal Agencies; and additional information (technical approach, summary work plan, description of computational and other resources, etc.) that support team's qualification for the project. Failure to complete a form may be reason for non-qualification of a team.   

SCOPE DEFINITION:

As part of the Yucca Mountain Repository development efforts, the Department of Energy has announced the Caliente rail corridor as its preferred corridor in which to construct a rail line in Nevada, and Carlin as a secondary preference.  If the Department adopts the mostly rail mode in Nevada, DOE will issue a Record of Decision selecting a rail corridor not sooner than 30 days after publication of the preference announcement in the Federal Register dated December 29, 2003.  The primary Caliente Corridor originates at a junction with the Union Pacific mainline near Caliente, Nevada and extends 319 miles to the Yucca Mountain site (see Figure 1), located approximately 90 miles north of Las Vegas.  The corridor is nominally 1/4 mile (400-meters) wide and consists of a "primary" corridor along with "secondary" options. After completing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), DOE will identify, in a Record of Decision (ROD), a single rail alignment within the corridor.  

Anticipated Duration

Duration of the work is estimated to be eighteen (18) months from Notice to Proceed.

Subcontractor's Work Performance and Organization:

The SUBCONTRACTOR shall perform at least 80% of the self-performed work (i.e. not third tier subcontracted work) at the SUBCONTRACTOR's offices.  
The SUBCONTRACTOR will be required to interact with CONTRACTOR's personnel in a timely and proactive manner.  The SUBCONTRACTOR is encouraged to consider the use of a project office within 5 miles of the CONTRACTOR's office as a means to accomplish this objective. 

The organization shall be lead by a permanent senior technical manager who shall be the principal point of contact between CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR and shall be responsible for all aspects of the SUBCONTRACTOR's work. The senior technical manager shall coordinate, direct and manage all work performed by the SUBCONTRACTOR in the Las Vegas project office, at SUBCONTRACTOR's home office and third tier subcontract work wherever performed. It is anticipated that in the day-to-day conduct of the work, SUBCONTRACTOR's personnel will be interacting and communicating with counterparts, project engineers or managers within CONTRACTOR’s staff. However, all work products and other technical deliverables shall be transmitted by SUBCONTRACTOR's senior technical manager to the CONTRACTOR's Nevada Transportation Project Manager. In addition, all technical correspondence concerning the conduct and execution of the work shall be between the SUBCONTRACTOR's senior technical manager and the CONTRACTOR's Nevada Transportation Project Manager and technical direction to the SUBCONTRACTOR will be provided only by the CONTRACTOR's Nevada Transportation Project Manager in writing.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R8-7MN1-04 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ)  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.   The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit is interested in acquiring a particle size analyzer.  The instrument should provide size and volume distributions in number, volume, surface area, and mass, with an overall particle size range of 0.4 to 1,200 micrometers in diameter.  This size range can be achieved with interchangeable aperture tubes.  The operating temperature range should be 5 degree C to 40 degree C. This analyzer’s method of operation should be based on the “Coulter Principle” (i.e. electrical sensing zone) to measure particle volume, a direct measurement of a physical property of the particle.  In the coulter method, particles are suspended in a weak electrolyte solution and drawn through a small aperture separating two electrodes between which an electric current flows.  The voltage applied across the aperture creates a “sensing zone”.  As each particle passes through the aperture it displaces its own volume of conducting liquid, momentarily increasing the impedance of the aperture.  This change in impedance produces a small but proportional current flow into an amplifier that converts the current fluctuation into a voltage pulse large enough to measure accurately.  The Coulter Principle states that amplitude of this pulse is directly proportional to the volume of the particle that produced it.  In addition, a metering device is used to draw a known volume of the particle suspension through the aperture, producing a count of the number of pulses and yielding the concentration of particles in the sample.  The instrument should utilize 300 channels for a sleeted range.  The instrument should be capable of generating up to 525,000 pulses per analysis.  The linearity should be with +/- 1% for diameter and +/- 3% for volume.  The aperture current accuracy should be at least +/- 0.4% of setting and the polarity error less than 0.5%.    The analyzer shall be delivered to the USDA, Cotton Production & Processing Research Unit, Rt. 3, Box 215, Lubbock, Texas 79403.  The Government “REQUIRES” delivery no later than 30 days after receipt of order. This delivery time is mandatory and is the maximum time allowed due to the ongoing research. Each offeror shall include their proposed delivery schedule as part of their quotation.  Acceptance and FOB point are destination.  In order to be considered for award offerors shall provide a quotation on company letterhead detailing the unit pricing; descriptive literature, brochures, and five references for the proposed equipment.  References must have received the proposed equipment within the last three calendar years (Government references preferred but will accept commercial references) shall also be provided for the product quoted.  FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items), FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation - Commercial Items), the significant evaluation factors, in the relative order of importance, are (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; and (iii) price (based on F.O.B. Destination), where technical and past performance are significantly more important than price.  and FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items) apply to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items) also applies, with the following clauses from (b) applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.203-6; FAR 52.219-4; FAR 52.219-8; FAR 52.219-23; FAR 52.222-26; FAR 52.222-35; FAR 52.222-36; FAR 52.222-37; FAR 52.225-16; FAR 52.232-36.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items), with this offer; a copy of this provision may be obtained from the contracting officer or at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Any amendment and documents related to this procurement will be available electronically at the Internet site: http://www.eps.gov.

The offeror must provide 315 units by December 2005.  The offeror must be a qualified source by that time.  The effort is to modify the TMD Fuze (currently in production) to a Government Performance Specification.

The offeror must produce a modified fuze that is qualified and tested.  The modified fuze must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze.  This project is considered to be medium to high risk based on safety of flight and integration with existing components.  The modified fuze must meet the safety requirements contained in MIL-STD-1316E and be approved by the Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB).  The offeror must provide a fuze design that incorporates current electronic technology.  The offeror must be able to provide a fuze with qualified and tested hardware.  The estimated contract cost for this effort is at or below $1,215,545.00 for fiscal year 2004/2005.  A firm fixed-price type contract is contemplated.  An export controlled Technical Data Package is available upon request and Government receipt of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.

It is not the Government’s intention to pay for information solicited.  No collect calls, or telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted.

Interested parties shall submit a capabilities package, which addresses all requirements listed in this announcement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Team, plans to negotiate a sole source contract with Concept Engineering Group (CEG), Verona, PA, for the development, fabrication, demonstration, testing, and maintanence of a Robotic Infrared Detection and Digging System (RIDDS).  The current Air-Spade system designed by CEG is a manually ope rated digging tool which uses compressed air and water to safely uncover landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO).  This effort seeks to improve the existing system by adding the capability of detecting buried objects using compressed hot water and an infr ared camera, as well as automating the detection and excavation process on an omni-directional robotic platform.  This integration effort can significantly improve the functionality of the Air-Spade equipment and provide greater safety to deminers worldwid e when performing manual demining operations. Under this effort, CEG as Prime Contractor along with the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University will perform the following tasks:  1)  Perform a preliminary design, build and test of an infrared detector which injects the soil with heated, compr essed water and uses an infrared camera to display buried objects in the soil;  2) Design, build, and integrate the infrared detector, a color video camera, and the air excavation equipment on an omnidirectional robotic platform.  The robotic platform may be tethered, via hoses and cables, to compressed air, heated water, and electrical power supplies.  The robotic platform shall provide operator feedback and control of its functions via remote control to an operator control station; 3) Perform evaluations and demonstrations of the final RIDDS prototype and characterize the performance limitations of the system. It has been determined that CEG is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1); Only One Responsible Source and  no Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required RIDDS improvements may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages.  The duration of this effort is 12 Months.  The resultant contract will be cost plus fixed fee.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email, telephone requests for a dditional information will not be honored.  You may forward responses to the following email address:  ellen.morris@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Number Note 22.

<DESC>Project Title & Location:  San Lorenzo River Contract 3 Construction Project, San Lorenzo River, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz County, California. Description: The San Lorenzo River Contract 3 construction project involves construction of a 900-foot-long so il nail wall along an eroding section of riverbank in the San Lorenzo River, located in the center of the City of Santa Cruz, California.  This wall ranges from 15-25 feet high and will require dewatering of the river at the base of the wall and constructi on area.  Soil nails spaced 5-feet-on-center will be drilled 5-30 feet deep into the riverbank and will need to avoid disturbing several sewer lines, waterlines, and gas lines.  One of the sewer lines is within one foot of the new wall.  The wall will have  a hand-sculpted shotcrete finish designed to resemble a natural rock wall face.  The wall will also be used to support a 12-foot-wide maintenance road and two City streets (Third Street and Laurel Street Extension).  The in-channel construction is limited  from 1 May to 31 October, so the wall will need to be constructed within this time in one construction season.  In-channel environmental restoration features (crib walls, log vanes, footer logs, root wads, etc.) will also need to be installed prior to 31 October.

<DESC>The notice is to clarify a misconception that many small business and some large business have had.  First, the RFQ DOL047RQ0001 is limited only to MOBIS SIN 874-1, 874-4, 874-6 schedule holders.  The RFQ does not restrict any small business of any kind that qualify from participating in this BPA downselect, nor does it restrict any large business that is qualified.  For those interested and that would bother to read their ENTIRE RFQ document, instead of what they want to read into it, they would clearly see that in all BPA agreements to be awarded give direct preference to Small Business in lieu of large business in making all initial BPA wards.  Further, the RFQ indicates that large business can partner, team or subcontract with small, and visa versa.  Therefore, and Contracting Officer I suggest reading the entire RFQ document and all amendments before making unwarranted phone calls that tie up and waste time.  Lastly, to the business that called and did not understand the purpose of NAIC codes and size standards, NAIC codes are for the purpose of describing what category of business, and tasking or functional area is covered, and the SB size standard is soley for the purpose of determining what the SBA believes should be eligible for Federal small business assistance programs...and has nothing to do with restrictions.

    The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This Amendment "001" is hereby issued to change the due date for quotes from 20 Jan 04 to 28 Jan 04.  The following questions and answers are herby provided.

1) Is there an NSN or manufacturers name and part number for this RFQ?

	No, brand name is not being specified.  Please quote per the purchase description.

2) What type of electrified monorail system is in place?  What is the beam size?

	The existing monorails in the plating shop are Acco Louden, 3.33 patent track, Series 604 Supertrack, catalog # 604.922.  The hoist and trolley must be suitable for 3”-9” radius, 180 degree turns.

3) The lift speed on the hoist is required 16ft per minute.  Is there a variance allowed +/- 5% so as to utilize different hoist manufacturers?

	The 16fpm hoists can be 15-21 fpm.  The hoists that are 11fpm or less must remain that way.  They are for a process that requires less than 11fpm.   

4) Will there be required installation and testing of the hoists?  Will subcontractors be required to dispose of existing hoists?

	No.

5) The specification calls for a power pilot light.  Do you just want a light on the hoist that indicates the power is on?

	The light indicating power to the hoist should be on the control pendant.

6) What type of electrification is currently on the monorail?

	We are going to use our existing collectors.

7) Do you need 14 electric chain hoists with trolleys?

	The specs indicate that we need 14 electric chain hoists lug-mounted to a trolley.

The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date.

<DESC>The following are the questions that were posed concerning the subject solicitation.  The answers immediately follow the questions. If you have any further questions, please contact SSgt Jennifer Nalls at (830) 298-4965 or email at jennifer.nalls@laughlin.af.mil or contact Mr. James Harper at (830) 298-5175 or email at james.harper@laughlin.af.mil. The response date has been extended to 15 December 2003 @ 1630 CST.

1. What is the size and weight of the bearings?


1’ to 51/2’ in diameter – variable weights not to exceed 1 pound.

2. What does demagnetizing mean?  Does it mean to prevent magnetizing or marring or does it mean to demagnetize already magnetized parts?


Demagnetizing was meant to convey that the system will need to be able to demagnetize bearings that have various levels of magnetization, (all bearing acquire magnetizing to various degrees).

3. Is a batch system or singly conveyed system desired?


A batch system is desired to enhance productivity.

4. Is it possible to visit the base and review the operations of the shop in question?


Yes, but please keep in mind that the government will not fund a site visit.  We ask that all site visits be conducted 5 days prior to the response date.  This is so that there are no more extensions to the response date. 

5. Is it possible to obtain drawings or photos of the bearings?  


Yes, they are attached to this amendment.

6. Is there a basic design or concept in mind?  


A dynamic flow multi-stage unit that washes, demagnetizes, rinses, and then saturates the bearing with protective oil at conclusion of process.

7. Will some of the bearings have splines on i.d. or o.d.?


No

8. Are the bearings enclosed or needle bearing type?  


The bearings are either roller or ball.  Most of them are retained.

9. Who manufactures the bearings?  


Various manufactures to include but not limited to New Hampshire Bearing Company and Timken.

10. What are the recommended/permissible cleaning chemicals and fluid temperatures from the manufacturer? 


Armakleen m-hp-2 has been approved for our application by our engineering section.

11. What is the approximate average amount of oil and grease in each bearing in ounces?


There are trace amounts of oil and grease.

12. Who is the manufacturer of the current cleaning material and what is it?
 

What we are currently using does not adequately clean.  It is PD-680.  This is why we have requested Armakleen m-hp-2 solvent.

13. Is bearing pre-cleaned to remove excessive grease etc before washing?


No, the unit must be designed to handle the cleaning required.  There are no greased bearings since all are lubricated with 7808 oil.  Our biggest concern is removing the carbon from hot section bearings.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-04-R-0003.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16 are incorporated.  NAICS 423450.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for a ceiling mounted medical examination light.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with a 3-year ordering period containing a minimum for 22 units and a maximum of 500.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with Offerors on an open competition basis to procure ceiling mounted medical examination lights for Navy ships of the line.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by  21 Jan 04. 

Technical evaluations will be conducted in three stages. Stage 1 is compliance with minimum salient essential characteristics. Stage 2 will be the evaluation of Past Performance information and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. Stage 3 will be the shipboard installation and demonstration of the product and the evaluation of the pricing proposal. The Technical Proposal shall address all the minimum salient characteristics.  The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal. Proposals should include Past Performance Information from three sources to include: 1.) Agency name; 2.) Agency point of contact and telephone number; 3.) Contract number; 4.) Type and number of units provided; and 5.) Delivery and Performance Information (Contract delivery schedules and actual delivery schedules.) 6.) Quality (Total number of units submitted for inspection and total number rejected.)  Proposals should include Pricing on the following items: 1.) Ceiling mounted medical examination light and 2.) Complete installation to make unit fully operational.  Information on the existing mount can be requested via email to Wendy Graybill at wlgraybill@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Pricing proposals shall include copies of published commercial price lists, or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to the general public for same or similar items. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror submitting the proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on an evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted by each offeror and the shipboard installation and demonstration.  The technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than cost.  In the event that two or more technical proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, the award may be made to the lower price proposal.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the low offeror.  Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms.  Failure to submit any information requested would result in a determination that the technical or pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Technical evaluation will be done in two stages.  Each offer must document compliances in Stage 1 before proceeding to Stage 2. Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.) Shall have a minimum 150 degrees of rotation about the extension arm; 3.) Shall have a minimum of 60 degrees of rotation about the yoke; 4.) Shall have a minimum of 90 degrees of rotation about the vertical support of the lighthead; 5.) The light color shall be within 15% of 4500 degrees Kelvin; 6.) Shall have a minimum illuminance of 50,000 Lux; 7.) The focal range shall start at a minimum of 24 inches and not extend past 50 inches from the lighthead; 8.) The lighthead shall not cause a temperature rise of more than 4oC; 9.) The lighthead shall have a minimum rating of 500 hours on the light source; 10.) Ship’s power will be supplied to the product at 120 VAC. In addition to the above mentioned essential characteristics, the proposal shall state that the ceiling mounted medical examination light shall be capable of passing the following tests: 1.) High Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 2.) High Temperature (Storage) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 120oF for 24 hours.  The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 3.) Low Temperature (Operational) - The test items will be placed in the chamber at 40oF, and the operational component is accomplished by cycling the lights on and off once per hour for 8 hours; 4.) Low Temperature (Storage) -The test items will be placed in the chamber at -60oF for 24 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; 5.) Humidity - Temperature will be set to 120oF and humidity was set to 90%.  The test items will be placed in the chamber for 8 hours. The systems will be removed from the chamber and operated to determine if they function; and 6.) Vibration - The test items will be placed on a single axis vibration table.  The test items will be exposed to the MIL-STD 810E, Method 514.4 vibration signature (copies available) for 30 minutes.  This vibration profile is a composite of what the military believes the equipment will be subjected to.  They will be removed from the table and operated to determine if they function.

Stage 2 will consist of a comparative evaluation of past performance information encompassing subfactors 1) Similar Work, 2) Delivery and 3) Quality and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. 

Stage 3: The offerors who provide acceptable proposals based on criteria above will be requested to demonstrate their products on 29 Jan 04 at the Naval Sea Systems Command in Norfolk, VA. at no expense to the Government.  Demonstration shall consist of the following parameters: 1.) Offerors will be limited to three personnel to represent their company; 2.) The Offerors will be given one hour to demonstrate their products. The demonstration will be used to evaluate the time and tools needed to install and make the light operational within a shipboard environment and meet minimum requirements in Stage 1 (items 1-10). Offerors will be further evaluated in the area of pricing. Pricing proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors, Completeness, Reasonableness and Realism. 

A determination of award will then be made to the offeror who has demonstrated a product that represents the best value to the Government. After award the contractor will provide a sample of their medical examination light for acceptance testing. The Government will test the sample to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in Stage 1 of this solicitation for survival within the shipboard environment.  Samples shall be 1.) Submitted at no expense to the Government; and 2.) Returned at the Contractors request and expense, which may be damaged during testing. Failure to meet the acceptance testing will result in a Termination of the contract and subsequent award to the next ranked vendor.

Questions received for Solicitation Number N62645-04-R-0003, Ceiling Mounted Medical Examination Lights

1) Are the lights to be used strictly as Exam Lights?

Yes.

2) Are there existing support structures installed in the ships to which the lights are to be attached, and if so, are the supports identical from ship to ship? Also we need complete details on the support structures (including dimensions), in addition to the adapter plate detail received.

The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of the more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle, this should only change the amount of wiring needed to complete the install.

3) The following dimensional information is required:
· The total interstitial space dimension between the finished ceiling and the structural ceiling above it.
· The dimension from the bottom of the existing support structure and the finished ceiling. 
· The dimension of floor to finished ceiling.
· A detail of any obstructions connected to the ceiling which could interfere with the operation and movement of the lights.

The support structure is different for each ship and different for each space.  The adapter plate will allow interface with the base plate of any one of the mounts.  I have drawings of more than 20 different support structures.  They vary in length and angle and are only a sample of all of the different mounts on one ship.  I don't think it is possible to obtain all of the drawings of all of the mounts for all of the ships in the Navy.

4) Is there a DC current capability back-up required? 

No.

5) During the demo phase, will we install our lights aboard a ship, a facsimile of a ship or do we need to provide our own facsimile to demonstrate installation?

One of the requirements during the demo was that the vendor install their light into a real ship in the Norfolk area.

6) I am inclined to assume the wiring is already installed and available for our lights to be wired to the existing 120v. However it is a question I need to know for sure.

The base of the light is wired on all ships for these installations.

7) Do we need to quote conduit or is that in place as well?

All conduit is in place on all ships for these installations.

8) Will all the installations of the medical lights over the duration of the contract be performed in the Norfolk area?

We will need the lights installed where the ships port.  Norfolk is one of the many areas.  San Diego is another, and there are several ship yards along the Gulf Coast of the U.S. (Pascagoula, MS, New Orleans, LA, etc.). 

9)  Should shipping be included in the price quote? If so, will all lights be shipped to the same place?  

Shipping probably should be included in the pricing.  They can line item it so that the comparisons are oranges to oranges.

R- Internal Consulting/Relocation Services – U.S. Dept. of Commerce/BEA invites your company to quote on the following:

Introduction

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (hereinafter referred to as ABEA@), located at 1441 L Street, NW, Washington, DC is scheduled to begin its comprehensive carpet replacement and cyclical painting beginning in January, 2004.  

BEA occupies 140,000 net usable square feet.  BEA has ten divisions and 440 employees and approximately 40 non-agency personnel.  Of the 10 floors fully- or partially- occupied by BEA, approximately 81,000 square feet will be recarpeted.  BEA has 2 swing space areas which can accommodate 37 and 55 persons.  If needed, an additional area accommodating 15 workstations can be used for selected cycles.  BEA is seeking a Contractor to handle communication, management, and coordination for and between bureau and program management, employees, and vendors.  Timely project completion is paramount.

Background

To accomplish the recarpeting, BEA needs to move program units from their currently assigned location to swing space available within building number.  Careful planning and coordination are required to schedule the moves which cannot be accomplished within two weeks of releases.  It will take 4 to 6 weeks to complete a cycle.  BEA has approximately 54 releases involving staff from 10 different divisions.  Some divisions are being returned to their currently assigned space, others are moving to new locations which must be included in the plan.

The project must be managed to accommodate the various division work and release schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who shall coordinate set up schedule, coordinate activities between the program units, move Contractor, furniture Contractor, lessor, and Bureau management.

The project should be scheduled to finish in the Fall of 2004.

Project Dates

Immediately through Fall 2004.


Description of Work

Project Management


The Contractor shall manage BEA=s carpet replacement and cyclical painting project.  BEA management must be consulted and kept fully informed.  BEA employees must be directed through the process to lessen anxiety and maximize effectiveness of the project.  Effective communication with management, program leaders, and employees will be mandatory.

Develop a communication and management plan which will include substantive information on the procedure to be implemented to ensure effective and efficient management of the program.  The plan will include schedules, budgets, information for distribution to all groups, coordination tasks, and other items which will ensure a successful program.

Coordination of vendor activities

Develop a coordination plan including schedules by working with all contractor involved, including the moving company, rental furniture contractor, building owner/building management company, and other related contractors.  The coordination plan will identify all requirements for the contractors including schedules, instructions, conducting interaction between groups, and requirements for the vendors.  The plan will be implemented to ensure that all contractors perform with maximum efficiency.

Scope and Complexity

Because scheduling and coordination are critical to success, we have provided a list of releases and a chart showing the size of the program units.  These should be considered in the management, communications, and coordination plans.

6 Project Descriptions and Profile

As Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia move closer to full European Union membership, several EU policies and directives make the move to waste-to-energy and renewable energy an imperative.  Pollution control mandates, renewable energy requirements and reductions in landfilling all create policy requirements to promote waste-to-energy and renewable energy.  This policy goal has caused many of the countries to implement mandatory purchase prices for energy formed from renewable sources (waste-to-energy is considered renewable).  These mandatory purchase prices and other policies can make waste-to-energy and renewable energy projects economically viable.  

The Waste-to-Energy and Renewable Energy Conference that USTDA hosted in Prague in December 2002 took the opportunity to capitalize on these trends.  More than 20 projects in this sector from North Central Europe countries were highlighted and presented at the conference.   Many of these projects had previously obtained USTDA feasibility study financing.

USTDA has funded feasibility studies on the following waste to energy and renewable energy projects within the last two years in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia:
§	Chelm Waste-to Energy Project – This project would build a power plant fueled by municipal waste for the generation of electric power and hot water in Chelm, Poland
§	Suwalki Wind Power Project – This project is a technical and economic assessment of a wind project in Suwalki, Poland.
§	250 MW Slupsk Offshore Wind Project – This project would involve more than 100 turbines off of the Baltic coast of Poland.
§	Druid Biomass-to-Energy Project – Druid intends to use its waste biomass to fuel new cogeneration units near Plzen, Czech Republic to generate heat and electricity for its operations.
§	Plzenska Teplarenska Waste-to-Energy Project – This project in Plzen, Czech Republic would involve the construction of a district heating plant powered by municipal waste.
§	PDI Plasma Gasification Project – The Czech grantee would utilize a state-of-the-art plasma gasification vitrification system to turn municipal waste and other waste into electricity.
§	KH Tebis Co-generation Biomass to Energy Project – This project would involve using biomass waste to power a cogeneration heat and power plant in Kutna Hora, Czech Republic.  
§	Slovnaft Incinerator Upgrade Project – This project involves the selection of the most modern waste-to-energy technology and equipment to upgrade and/or replace three incinerator units in Slovakia.

The DM consultant will visit most of the above-mentioned projects along with Mr. Greenip.  The purpose of this effort would be both to determine the current status of each of the projects and to consider ways to move the projects toward implementation.  This will allow for better analysis of the projects’ actual or potential (depending on the stage of the project) U.S. exports and development impact.  The DM consultant will be able to analyze the projects individually and the strategy as a whole to help USTDA determine future strategy in the waste-to-energy and renewable energy sector.

Although Mr. Greenip will not travel to Hungary, the DM consultant should also review projects in Hungary that USTDA has funded, including:
§	Greenergy Wind Park Project – Greenergy Kft. proposes to build a wind park of 80 to 100MW of installed capacity in various sites in Hungary.
§	Ajka Solid Waste Eco-Processing Feasibility Study – This project would involve a high solids anaerobic digestion plant in Ajka, Hungary.
§	Tapioszele Disposed Rubber Recycling Project  – The municipality of Tapioszele examined the establishment of a joint-venture disposed rubber recycling facility using cutting-edge, environmentally neutral pyrolysis technology. 
§	Druid Biomass-to-Energy Project – Druid intends to use its waste biomass to fuel new cogeneration units near Plzen, Czech Republic to generate heat and electricity for its operations.

The DM consultant will also review waste-to-energy and renewable energy projects in the three countries and in Hungary.  In large part due to the success of the conference, USTDA has received a number of proposals for USTDA funding of feasibility studies in the waste-to-energy and renewable energy sector. The following projects will be reviewed:
§	Petrochema Waste to Energy Project:  This project would involve construction of a regional incineration plant in eastern Slovakia that would replace two out-of-date incineration plants owned by Petrochema a.s., a large Slovak chemical company.  The current plants do not meet emission standards set to take effect in the near future.  This project is expected to be funded by structural EU funds, internal sources and the attraction of a strategic investor.
§	KV Venti Wind Energy Project:  KV Venti Ltd., a private Czech developer of wind projects, is planning to initially install approximately six wind turbines near either Most or Nachod in the Czech Republic.  Both of the locations are in mountainous areas that have good wind potential.  
§	Powiat Nowy Tomysl wind energy project:  a wind power facility is currently being developed west of the city of Poznan, with an expected installed capacity of 100.5 MW.  Total project costs are estimated at $105 million, with the majority of costs consisting of payment for turbines.
§	MOL Biofuels Project:  This project would involve the production of biofuels (gasoil, biodiesel, etc.) in order to meet an EU mandate of 2% biofuels production by 2005.  MOL as one of the largest refiners in Central Europe must comply with Hungarian implementation of this mandate.  MOL has access to capital markets and is a profitable firm, so this project could be financed from internal sources or through balance sheet debt financing.
§	MOL Geothermal Power Project:  This project would involve the construction of a 2-5 Megawatt geothermal power plant, which would produce electricity.  Existing hydrocarbon wells would be explored and developed.  The total project cost is estimated at $14 million in the case of a 5-megawatt plant.  
§	BKZ Somogy County WTE project:  BKZ, a Hungarian developer of waste-to-energy would construct a waste-to-energy facility in Somogy County, Hungary.
§	BKZ Duna Refinery CHP:  This project would involve the construction of a combined heat and power plant on the premises of MOL’s Duna Refinery.
§	Municipal solid waste gasifier in Szegd County:  BKZ would develop a municipal solid waste gasifier in conjunction with municipal authorities in Szegd County, Hungary.

<DESC>Project Title & Location:  San Lorenzo River Contract 3 Construction Project, San Lorenzo River, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz County, California. Description: The San Lorenzo River Contract 3 construction project involves construction of a 900-foot-long so il nail wall along an eroding section of riverbank in the San Lorenzo River, located in the center of the City of Santa Cruz, California.  This wall ranges from 15-25 feet high and will require dewatering of the river at the base of the wall and constructi on area.  Soil nails spaced 5-feet-on-center will be drilled 5-30 feet deep into the riverbank and will need to avoid disturbing several sewer lines, waterlines, and gas lines.  One of the sewer lines is within one foot of the new wall.  The wall will have  a hand-sculpted shotcrete finish designed to resemble a natural rock wall face.  The wall will also be used to support a 12-foot-wide maintenance road and two City streets (Third Street and Laurel Street Extension).  The in-channel construction is limited  from 1 May to 31 October, so the wall will need to be constructed within this time in one construction season.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes."  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. SDO is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LWS) program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA's understanding of the solar process and space weather. SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees. SDO will have a mission life of 5 years. SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high-rate data (150-200 Mbps) steam transmitted at Ka-band (25.5-27 GHz) by one of two High-Gain Antennas (HGA) mounted to the spacecraft. The HGA will be rotated by an Azimuth-Elevation gimbal driven by the actuators in question. NASA/GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding space-qualified Rotary Actuators for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) project.  The present requirements are specified in the following attached documents:	Performance Specification, Gimbal Elevation & Azimuth Actuator Assemblies (GAA), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project 464-MECSM-SPEC-0028 (Exhibit 1) and the Statement of Work (SOW) for Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project High-Gain Antenna Gimbal Actuators 464-MECH-LEGL-0015 (Exhibit 2). Deliverable hardware will comprise two categories defined as Engineering Test Units (ETU) and Flight Units (FU) with the following quantities and delivery dates: ETU - Qty: 2 Units, Delivery due 6 months after contract award; FU - Qty: 8 Units, Delivery of a pair of units will be due at 8, 10, 12, and 14 months after award. This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work and Specification via the internet, and solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information for a Gimbal Actuator that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA/GSFC's knowledge of industry's capabilities in the area of space-qualified gimbal actuators.  NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that will be used to determine eligibility to be participants in one-on-one discussions. This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202. The intent of the discussions is to provide a dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA/GSFC's requirements and its acquisition approach. The compilation of submitted information and discussion results from all viable participants will be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned Performance Specification (Exhibit 1) and SOW (Exhibit 2). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1. Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW. Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comments that either describe how a potential offeror's actuator could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror's position on such a requirement. This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one discussions.  It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable.  2. Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule.	3. Summary of past relevant experience in developing space-qualified actuators.  This notice constitutes all information concerning the Gimbal actuator procurement that will be furnished at this time.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. The discovery, development, and evaluation of promising HIV microbicides is a high priority for the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH).  To augment the microbicide product pipeline, we are seeking opportunities to advance microbicide concepts toward the product stage via a focused, product development-based approach.  Specifically, the long-range goal of this solicitation is the development of new safe and effective microbicide candidates that merit further evaluation in large human trials. The HIV Microbicide Design and Development Teams (HMDDT) solicitation seeks to fund consortia of scientists with product development experience from industry and/or academia that have 1) identified a promising microbicide concept, and 2) devised a plan for its targeted development into a product testable in humans.  A microbicide product is defined here to be a material and its manner of administration that could reasonably provide protection against the sexual transmission of HIV safely, even when used repeatedly.  The expectation is that the Teams advance their microbicide concepts along a well-defined development path in a timely manner to a microbicide product and into clinical testing within the five-year period of the award.  Offerors are encouraged, but not required to conduct phase I/II trials in collaboration with the NIH/NIAID/DAIDS-supported HIV Prevention Trials Network (the HPTN; http://www.hptn.org). Support for Phase III studies will not be funded under this solicitation.  

Because the goal of this effort is the development of microbicide products, each Team will be required to demonstrate proven scientific and development expertise, and provide a comprehensive plan that lays out clearly defined objectives and milestones for the project’s duration.  Because the design and development path for any microbicide product cannot be entirely anticipated, the Team must articulate its vision of how new scientific findings will be integrated into the proposed goals and milestones.  Offerors will be required to articulate and implement a strategic research plan that includes: (a) key development objectives and a detailed work plan describing proposed time schedules for achieving contract objectives and milestones, and maintaining quality control over the implementation and operation of the contract, (b) how decisions to proceed or not proceed will be made (i.e. specific qualitative and quantitative criteria for product advancement through each stage of preclinical, including IND-enabling, development and Phase I/II safety evaluations), (c) plans for GMP microbicide lot production and packaging, and (d) obtaining the necessary regulatory and human subjects approvals to proceed.  This strategic plan shall articulate how the Team will efficiently allocate and utilize the resources, and redirect the focus (including reallocation of funds) depending upon the project’s changing needs and emerging new knowledge.  It shall, also, articulate how patent coverage and licensing of the resulting HIV microbicide will be obtained and the procedures to be followed for the resolution of potential legal issues that may arise.

Interested small business organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas above, to be received no later than 3:30 PM local time on February 2, 2004, to the attention of Anita Hughes at the address listed above.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 22.  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT FRAN DE ROSA AT 708-786-5921 OR FRAN.DEROSA@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Patient Gowns (Multi-Purpose, I.V., Telemetry, and X-Ray)  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various patient gowns.   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.  Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERION PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criterion contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.

<SUBJECT>A--NOTICE OF INTENT TO RELEASE A RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (RA) FOR PROPOSALS ON PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
<DESC>The new NASA/USRA Center for Program/Project Management Research has been established to support NASA's APPL Program by providing access to the research capabilities of the broader academic community to address the critical management challenges in today's aeronautics and space programs, while also supporting academia's mission in workforce development, conducting cutting edge research, and in the management of university based projects and programs.	In order to identify, define, and prioritize the most critical research topics for inclusion in the first research announcement, CPMR organized a workshop held on December 9 - 10, 2003, in Columbia, Maryland.  Participants included representatives from universities, industry, NASA, and other government agencies that were either practitioners or researchers in relevant fields.  More information on CPMR, APPL, and the workshop is available at: http://cpmr.usra.edu/ The Universities Space Research Association (USRA) intends to issue a Research Announcement (RA), on or about January 30, 2004, to solicit Phase 1 proposals in program and project management research, which will be competitively awarded through a peer review process.  Subsequently, CPMR intends to fund multi-year awards following competitive selection of Phase 2 proposals from successful Phase 1 principal investigators (PIs).   Selected PIs will become CPMR Fellows, and invited to participate in the full range of Institute activities, thus becoming a repository of knowledge and expertise to assist NASA with its challenging issues in program and project management.  Given the objectives of the CPMR, eligibility is open to university-led proposals; however, where appropriate, we encourage participation from other types of organizations through teaming arrangements with the PIs.   Although optional, USRA would like to receive notices of intent to propose by January 23, 2004.  The proposal due date is March 15, 2004.  Please send a message to the contact e-mail address including your name, affiliation, contact information, and a very brief description of your tentative research area or topic.

<SUBJECT>--Sole source Purchase Order to build 10 Stereo Lithography and 10 Commercial-off the-shelf Helmets using present Coxswains Helmet integrated systems to test out new designs for potential improvements to the Coxswains Helmet.
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 15.3, the U.S. Army RDEC, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Army Ã¢Â€Â“ Soldier System Center, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with Wilcox Industries Corporation, 125 Aviation Avenue, Unit 2, Portsmouth, NH 03801-2833.  This effort is for Wilcox to build 10 Stereo Lithography and 10 Commercial-off the-shelf Helmets using present Coxswains Helmet integrated systems such as Ni ght Vision Goggles (NVGÃ¢Â€Â™s) to test out new designs for potential improvements to the Coxswains Helmet with the integrated system. Wilcox has unique capabilities and is the only active integrator of the NVG system that is used on the existing helmets.  Part of the NVG design is based on the geometry of the Helmet and any helmet in the future must be designed around the same geometry. Any effort to compete this action would result in a redundancy of time, effort and cost of qualifying and testing another  companyÃ¢Â€Â™s abilities to provide a NVG system and integrate it into the Coxswain Helmet. If a new helmet and integration system results in the requirement for production quantities, a full and open solicitation may be issued. Any questions concerning t his acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Sean P. Murphy (AMSRD-ACC-N) or by E-mail. This notice expires January 30, 2004.
