<DESC>The Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) DHS plans on awarding a non-competitive contract (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity-ID/IQ type) to Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) and Microsoft Premier Support Services (MPSS), from Microsoft Corporation (?Microsoft?).  The contract will have a base year and 4 one-year options with task order issued against the contract. This is in support of CBP?s mission, compliance and direction of DHS, federal and executive mandates, national security, and emergency response.  The Office of Information and Technology (OIT) is responsible for implementation and support of information technology (IT), research and development functions, and automation and technological strategies for meeting mission-related needs. Specifically, OIT  is responsible for automated information systems, management of the research and development functions and all forensic and laboratory support of the agency. OIT manage all computer and related resources including all operational aspects of the Computer Security Program; establish requirements for computer interfaces between U.S. Customs and Border Protection and various trade groups and Government agencies; and manage matters related to automated import processing and systems development. OIT focuses on integrating business and technical solutions across the OIT enterprise with an emphasis on a collaborative approach. 

The objective is to provide access to Microsoft Services in support of CBP?s effort in planning, implementing, deploying, using, and maintaining its Microsoft software, solutions, and technologies.  Access includes CBP?s ability to establish unique and singularly distinct access to Microsoft?s product divisions that is necessary to support and maintain CBP?s far-reaching mission.

RFP/HHSI161200700001C:  SCOPE OF WORK:  The existing pneumatic HVAC control system and all associated equipment and devices for the clinic are to be replaced with a new direct digital control (DDC) system.  This work includes replacing existing control valves, dampers, space sensors, and all required programming, network cabling, etc., required to put the system into full operation.  The central plant HVAC control system shall be integrated with the DDC system proposed above.  The system will be programmed to allow remote monitoring and control of the plant equipment.  The existing central air-handling unit serving the building will be reused, but will have the fan speed increased.  The existing motor will be replaced with a larger, high efficiency motor that is capable of meeting the new CFM and static pressure requirements of the system.  The quantity of outside air entering the unit will also be increased as required by the current building occupancy.  As required by the specifications, a new filter bank will be added and will serve as the final filter section.  The existing split system air conditioning unit will be reused, but retooled to only serve the Computer Data Room.  The existing exhaust fan EF-10 will be replaced.  All other exhaust fans will be reused.  In response to complaints of dust entering the building through the existing sidewall exhaust louvers, new hooded shields will be installed at the existing louvers.  The existing hot water baseboard heaters will remain, but the wall-mounted thermostat will be replaced with a control valve at the heater.  The existing chilled water system will be reused, but the existing pneumatic controls will be replaced with DDC controls.  The existing heating water system will be reused, but the existing pneumatic controls will be replaced with DDC controls.  All of the existing spaces will be re-balanced.

This procurement is to contract for up to two PASS detector units enhanced for military use, with an option for subsequent acquisition of up to three PASS detector units with further miltary-specific enhancements. This effort seeks to optimize the detector for use in a military operational environment by simplifying the software graphical user interface; providing enhanced user friendliness and capabilities; enhanced detection reproducibility, consistency and minimized risk for false alarms; and increased in-field performance of the detector. These enhanced capabilities will provide military personnel/users of the detector a significantly more reliable method of screening cargo/materials for different types of contraband items of potential concern that might be hidden in cargo/materials containers.  The effort is separated into two phases, the base (Phase 1) is directed at enhancing the unit to provide further automation and an alternative readout, to specifically address user interface issues noted in an initial evaluation of the commercial PASS detector unit during operational testing in May 2006. The option (Phase 2) is directed at

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Alternate Block 2 (Lunar Direct Return) Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials and design concepts in support of heat shield development for Orion (NASAs Crew Exploration Vehicle).  Highlights of the acquisition strategy plan and draft documents will be posted to provide potential offerors and interested parties with insight into the Governments acquisition strategy for this procurement.  Input from interested parties in response to those postings will be requested.   Award was made to the Boeing Company/Fiber Materials Inc. on September 14, 2006 for material and design development of a Block 2 PICA-based heat shield solution, in response to RFP NNA06145270R.  Deliverables under that contract include: TPS material samples for testing and characterization;  A full-scale (5.0 meter diameter) heat shield manufacturing demonstration unit (MDU); Local design demonstration units (LDDU);a TPS thermal response model for the contractors system;a material constituents list/description, properties and specifications database;a heat shield preliminary design;  TPS material properties testing; TPS trade studies aimed at reducing the risks associated with the contractors system; and  a detailed heat shield implementation plan.  Block 2 Phase II deliveries will be complete by January 2008, in preparation for the Orion Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in March 2008.   This procurement of alternate Block 2 TPS materials and heat shield systems designs is being issued to provide mitigation against the risk of only pursuing a single Block 2 TPS material and heat shield system.  This procurement is geared towards risk reduction and technology development and is not specifically tied to the critical path schedule for Orion Initial Operating Capability (IOC).  The goal for each offered TPS material and heat shield system is to advance from a starting Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 3 to the highest possible ending TRL (at least 6), and to attain an Integration Readiness Level (IRL) of at least 3 within the contract period of performance ending in September 2008.  It is anticipated that between one and three awards will be issued for this procurement.  The Statement of Work (SOW) for each contract awarded under this procurement will be tailored to the maturity of each of the proposed systems and will be modeled on the SOW in the original Block 2 Phase II RFP NNA06145270R.	   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 336419 and 1,000 employees, respectively.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The anticipated release date of acquisition plan highlights and draft documents is approximately October 16, 2006.  The draft RFP is expected to be released in late October, followed by release of the final RFP mid-November 2006.

Labor Categories CFb, GB1NM, G2ANM, FAIV NM and H2 are described as labor categories but are not included in the Cost/Price Template. Are we to submit prices for these additional labor categories with (Zero or no Hours)?   The NM positions were an oversight on the SOW.  There are currently NO positions in New Mexico.  The rest are valid labor categories, but for which we don't have a current need.  However, these labor categories will be used for evaluation purposes only. 3.	Attachment 1 has the Dates of Period of Performance starting December 1, 2006 - September 30, 2007 which equals a 10 month period, the hours or estimated quantities are 1872 for each labor category, should these hours 1872 per FTE represent 12 months or 10 months?

Will instructions to complete the Hypothetical Task Order Scenario be provided?  No Hypotehtical task order scenario is required. b.	We assume Key personnel is the PM and the Exempt positions only  - is this correct? Yes c.	We assume Signed letters of commitment are for the PM and the Company Management (not all 56 incumbent staff members currently working on the contract for the incumbent contactor ATA Services.)  Yes d.	We assume there is no specific format desired by the client for the Transition Plan in the Technical Proposal.   Correct e.	Does the 21 page limit apply to the Hypothetical Tasks order scenario alone?  No hypothetical task order scenario is required f.	Is there a page limit for resumes, singed letters of commitment?

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00007.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541620.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.  Project Identification:   Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Sulfur Oxides:  Toxicological Effects of Oxides of Sulfur in Experimental Animals and In vitro Test Systems II.  Period of Performance:   24 months from award date III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs  and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   503 hours for Tasks 1-8 (162 hours for Optional Tasks (7a, 9, and 10) Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment  (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is now in the process of  reviewing the NAAQS for sulfur oxides (SOx).  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary NAAQS for SO2 at 0.14 parts per million (ppm), averaged over a period of 24 hours and not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 0.030 ppm annual arithmetic mean based on the findings outlined in the  original 1970 AQCD, Air Quality Criteria for Sulfur Oxides.  In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter and Sulfur Oxides along with an addendum of newly published controlled human exposure studies, which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards  were based.  A second addendum presenting newly available evidence from epidemiologic and human controlled exposure studies was published in 1986 followed by a supplement to the second addendum in 1994.  On April 26, 1988, the EPA announced its proposed decision not to revise the standards for SOx.   In that notice, the Administrator also solicited comment on an alternative of adding a 1- hour primary standard of 0.4 ppm.  On November 15, 1994, the EPA proposed not to revise the 24 hour and annual standard but solicited comments on adding a new 5-minute standard of 0.60 ppm, with one expected  exceedance. The final decision on May 22, 1996 stated that revisions of the NAAQS for SOx was not appropriate at that time.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's  proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the SOx SA by September 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the SOx air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the SOx SA,  including completion of the first draft of the SOx SA by June 2007. The scientific information on SOx shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting  sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting.  Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a   focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the SOx SA for public and CASAC review,  before completion of the final SOx SA. EPA NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on SOx physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental  sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. Under this order, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks  described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-3, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor or consultant  is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.  All requests for these documents need to be submitted by close of business October 24,  2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>A solicitation will be issued to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with an as-needed mechanism to obtain various operational, technical and professional support services for a variety of tasks, studies, and projects to be performed for CDC throughout the United States. The services ordered under this contract shall service the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH) and other Centers, Institutes and Offices (CIOs) who need domestic services or staffing to support international activities. Services to be performed shall be non-personal and not inherently governmental services.

The following is a DRAFT Statement of Work:

                   STATEMENT OF WORK:


A.	          BACKGROUND and NEED:

CDCs mission is to promote the health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. As part of this mission, CDC is tasked with implementing programs through the Coordinating Center for Global Health (COGH) to ensure that people around the world will live safer, healthier lives through protecting Americans at home and abroad from health threats via a transnational prevention, detection and response network and establishing CDC and the United States Government as trusted and effective resources for health development around the globe. CDC addresses critical global public health challenges through working with a diverse set of partners to support the development and implementation of culturally-appropriate public health interventions.  Through our health promotion activities, both domestically and abroad, CDC contributes to reductions in global morbidity and mortality. 

 There are major programs that have been implemented globally within the last several years that have greatly expanded the global mission of the CDC and have prompted the need for increased services and staffing domestically to support those activities. As more international health crises are identified, the CDC Global Health mission and response is expanded.  The major international programs currently are the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Global Disease Detection (GDD), Pandemic and Avian Influenza Initiative, Polio Elimination worldwide, Reduction of Measles Related Mortality and Promotion of Child Health. CDC currently has about 200 staff in 45 countries around the world and those global staff are supported by the CIOs and programs here in Atlanta.  This scope of activities and CDC international support will expand as the need arises globally and this contract would cover that increased mission.

Additionally, there has been an overseas rightsizing initiative so that only those individuals who must be stationed overseas are located at international sites and much of the support is provided from Atlanta and other CDC locations domestically.  To facilitate this mission, CDC is charged with specific responsibilities which often necessitate seeking outside professional and technical expertise. The international contractor expertise by domestic staff is critical to the achievement of the overall efforts under these programs. In scaling up for the global mission, the mechanisms for hiring staff are often limiting and can take months to finalize. In addition, there are very limited mechanisms for hiring expert consultants to provide technical assistance. These impediments and delays in hiring staff hinder program development. It is therefore essential that CDC supplement its technical and professional staff through Contractor support.

B.   	 SCOPE OF WORK:

The services to be acquired under this contract provide a mechanism for various operational support and professional services tasks, studies, and projects to be performed for CDC throughout the United States. The Contractor is advised that it is not possible to determine the precise types or amounts of services, supplies and/or equipment that will be ordered during the term of the contract. The Contractor shall be obligated to perform within the minimum and maximum order limitations set forth in clauses 52.216-19, Order Limitations. The time of issuance and amount of work in task orders cannot be accurately predicted. The Government will make every effort to give the Contractor advance notice of requirements, but the services for which this contract will be used could address an immediate need involving an emergency situation or short notice requirements. Services to be performed shall be non-personal and not inherently governmental services. Supplies and equipment are incidental to the required services to be performed and shall be ordered on an as needed basis on each individual task order.  Some temporary international travel may be necessary and will be detailed in each individual task order.

C.	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor shall provide short term and long term technical support and professional services to various offices within the United States in support of the CDC as outlined in the individual task orders. The Contractor shall design, manage, and implement programs for global health activities to include HIV/AIDS, Infectious Diseases, Global Disease Detection (GDD), training of staff, population and basic education activities.  This list is not all inclusive of the activities that are supported by COGH and as CDC support of global health initiatives increase, this contract will provide support.   These individuals may be recruited from both within the Contractors organization and through its network of contacts. Category skill requirements will include professional (including medical fields,) and technical personnel.  

The professional personnel will be mid-career or senior professionals in the basic education and public health sectors as called for in the scope of work provided for each individual task order. Professional personnel will have a masters or higher level degree in fields related to public health or education or if appropriate experience that qualifies them for mid-career and senior positions, specifically with reference to those public health requirements as specified in each task order.  Professional personnel will also have 7 to 10 years of experience working in the specific or related discipline.

Direct labor categories utilized to perform the requirements of individual task orders will generally fall within the following skill requirements. A general description of each direct labor category skill requirement is as follows:

Technical  				

This category includes occupations concerned with providing technical assistance to public health, medical and scientists personnel in both laboratory and office activities. Characteristic of occupations in this category is the requirement for knowledge of scientific research techniques and analyzing data.

This category may also include occupations concerned with providing technical solutions with regards to security compliance, training, operational support, technical and development support, international or global experience and technical knowledge in a myriad of international activities. Characteristic of occupations in this category are the requirements for knowledge of information technology principles and techniques and public health program management experience that is less than full professional knowledge but which nevertheless enables the technician to understand how and why a specific device, skill or system operates.  This category may also include technical support positions for any international activities at CDC.

Professional A	 		

This category includes occupations having a recognized status based upon acquiring professional knowledge through prolonged study or experience. Examples of these professions include, but are not limited to, accountancy, public health and medical professionals. To be a professional employee, a person must not only be a professional but must be involved essentially in discharging professional duties.  

Professional B	 		

This category includes occupations having a recognized status based upon acquiring professional knowledge through the study of sciences such as biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, psychology, and medicine.  These professions perform medical, psychological, or veterinary science. Examples of these professions include, but are not limited to: pharmacists, registered nurses, physicians, hospital ancillary personnel, surgeons, research personnel, occupational healthcare providers, mental health care providers, behavior modification specialists, dentists, and veterinarians.  To be a professional employee, a person must not only be a professional but must be involved essentially in discharging professional duties.


D.	SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:

As part of providing services under this contract, the Contractor shall meet the following requirements:

1.	Management:
The Contractor shall employ management practices that ensure all requirements are fulfilled in a technically compliant and timely manner and manage services on a global basis.  This includes both day-to-day contract requirements and individual task order requirements and objectives.

2.	Recruitment and Retention:
The Contractor shall employ hiring and retention practices that ensure the Contractor is able to identify, screen, place, monitor, train, and retain qualified candidates to fulfill service requirements under this contract. The Contractor shall maintain a database of applications for appropriate candidates, accessible by education, field of expertise, work experiences, certifications, languages and other skills.

3.	Supervision:
Differing task order requirements, as well as the number and types of skills involved, will necessarily result in a variety of different approaches to supervision.  These two examples are intended to be illustrative rather than definitive when providing a wide variety of services in a number of locations: 

a.	A task order may require a number of skill categories to perform a single task (e.g., operate a small laboratory).  In this instance, it is anticipated that the senior technical skill category may assume a supervisory or lead responsibility with no increase in hourly rate.

b.	A number of task orders may require single on-site individuals.  In these instances, off-site supervision with occasional visitation is usually the most economical method to be used.

4.	Contractor Personnel
The Contractor shall provide English-speaking and foreign language translators, skilled personnel, with the professional and management services necessary to successfully meet Government requirements.  Required skill categories are defined in terms of typical duties and performance level standards.

The Contractor shall provide skill levels and labor mix appropriate for the task(s) to be performed.

The Contractor and Contractor employees shall conduct only business covered by this contract during periods paid for by the Government and shall not conduct any other business on Government premises.

Federal regulations prohibit the use of any controlled substances and alcoholic beverages while Contractor employees are working on Federal property or in Federal installations.  Contractor personnel shall be made aware of these requirements prior to commencing work under this contract.

All Contractor personnel shall be United States (U.S.) citizens or permanent residents.  Any exceptions to the citizenship requirement in the United States, territories, and possessions must involve individuals legally in the country, holding valid work permits.  All services provided by persons who are not United States citizens require the prior written approval of the CO.

Contractor personnel are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner at all times.  Inappropriate conduct and/or substance abuse will not be tolerated.  The Contractor will be responsible for removing the individual from the facility and taking such other action as appropriate. 

If unusual behavior and conditions threaten the orderly conduct of business occurring during the course of an assignment, the Contractor will be responsible for removing the individual from the facility and taking other action as appropriate.

If the Contractor personnel must speak and read in a language other than English, or have other required skills, the Government will state those requirements in the task order request and subsequent task order.

5.	Training  
The Contractor, at its own expense, shall perform training, except: 

The Government will provide orientation and training on specific department, unit, site, programs or education requirements, policies, and procedures peculiar to the work to be performed by the Contractor. 

If the Contractor changes employees during the performance of tasks frequently enough to interfere with Government operations and impose a burden on Government training staff, the Contractor will be subject to training cost negotiation, in addition to review of whether performance levels have been met.

Limited training of Contractor employees may be authorized (i.e., when the client changes software systems during the performance of an ongoing task and it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to retain a Contractor employee for corporate experience and familiarity with the project in progress.)

The Government will not authorize training for Contractor employees to attend seminars, symposiums, or user group conferences unless certified by the Contractor that attendance is mandatory for the performance of task requirements and such training is approved in advance by the Project Officer.

Training at Government expense shall not be authorized for replacement personnel for the sole purpose of keeping Contractor employees abreast of advances in the state-of-the-art technology or for training Contractor employees on equipment, computer languages, and computer operating systems for which training is available on the commercial market.

When the Government has given prior approval for training to meet special requirements that are peculiar to a particular task order, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for tuition, travel, and per diem as required in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations, as well as for labor hours at the rate designated in the task for the particular skill level. 

The Contractor shall assume full responsibility for keeping Contractor employees abreast of advances in state-of-the-art technologies.


6.	Workload Management
The Contractor shall implement management systems and controls for recording and monitoring workloads for all tasks.  This system shall include a means for acquiring signed time cards (by the point of contact on the task order) to be submitted with invoices for firm fixed price and cost reimbursement task orders. The systems shall be capable of providing historical and in-process workload data segregated by task order. 

7.	Transition and Succession
The Contractor shall have a transition and succession plan that demonstrates the capability to ensure a smooth transition with current contracts and/or successor contracts with a minimum of disruption to customer services.

Within 15 calendar days of contract award, the Government will meet with the Project Officer to identify Contractor employees who have provided services to various customer agencies under other contracts that may be transitioned to this contract.  Determinations will be made in cases where there is some question as to whether a person would be continuing to perform the same or substantially the same service for CDC.

At the end of the contract period, the Contractor may be required to continue performance to complete tasks (as compared to level of effort task orders) issued prior to the effective date of any successor contract, unless terminated by the CO. The Contractor shall also be expected to work with the follow-on Contractor(s) to ensure a smooth transition.




This is a competitive small business set-aside.  The CDC will award a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract.  The contract period of performance will be five (5) years from date of award.  The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 541990.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the Document Type ?from Presoliciation Notice to Combine Synopsis/Solicitation and respond to the questions as follows:

1.
Question:
What will be the timing for the breakout rooms?
 
Response:  
We have not defined the conference timetable at this point.  However, we estimate that there will be a total of 4 breakout periods per day lasting approximately 1.5 hours.  # of breakout rooms is defined below in response to Q5.


2.
Question:
What AV equipment is needed and do you need audio visual equipment in the breakout rooms as well?

Response:  
Until each workshop/conference sessions have been defined it is unclear exactly what AV equipment is necessary.  However, we will definitely require access to flipcharts and markers in all breakout rooms, and equipment that will allow us to present PowerPoint and other presentations on monitors in the larger meeting room and some breakout rooms.

Recommend we state something similar to the following: 

Vendors shall quote the following packages for audio visual support:

Package #1 ? Large Meeting Rooms:  Complete support package in order for 100-attendees to adequately see and hear all items presented in a conference setting.  Items should include but are not limited to: video projectors, screens, speakers, microphones, etc. (Estimated quantity - package support for each day of conference)

Package #2 ? Breakout Meeting Rooms:  Complete support package in order for 25-attendees to adequately see and hear all items presented in a conference room setting.  Items should include but are not limited to: video projector, screen, speakers, microphone, etc. (Estimated quantity is for 3-rooms each day of the event.  Price shall be per package per room)

3.
Question:
The arrival date is December 3 for about 30 guests, 50 more guests would arrive on December 4 and the 80 room block would start on December 4 and depart on December 8 - is this correct?  Not sure if they are staying for 3 or 4 nights - please clarify the pattern below:

Dec 3   Dec 4   Dec 5  Dec 6  Dec 7  Dec 8
30           30       30       30        30     Depart
              50        50      50       50       Depart

30          80        80       80      80       Total


Response:  
The Agency has adjusted the approximate numbers for four of the five days and the incoming number for Dec. 4.  Please be advised that we are expecting between 80 and 100 participants and will not be able to confirm the exact number until mid November.  Pricing is based on a per/person ? per/day cost.

Dec 3   Dec 4   Dec 5  Dec 6  Dec 7  Dec 8
30          30        50       50        50       Depart
              20        50       50        50       Depart

30          50        100     100      100      Total


4.
Question:
What size are the breakouts? 

Response:  
The breakouts should be able to accommodate up to 25 individuals.


5.
Question:
What day(s) will you need these rooms? 

Response:  
Breakout rooms will be required all five days and the approximate quantity per day is as follows.   Exact information about the number of breakout rooms required per day will be available by the first of November. Breakout rooms should be priced per/room ? per/day with a statement of how many will be available at maximum capacity.

12/4	12/5	12/6	12/7	12/8
3	5	8	8	5

6.
Question:
How many off-site events are planned and to what location?

Response: 
The only off-site activity, if not available on site, would be the team building requirement.  Location will depend on what?s available in the selected site. If offsite, transportation will be provided by the contractor.  This event should be priced as its own line item for an estimate of 100-individuals.  We are only requesting that a team building site be available either on site or off site.  It has not yet been determined that we will fit this into the schedule so we want the flexibility to negotiate that separately once we have a better sense of the scheduling.

7.
Question:
Is an e-mail proposal acceptable?  

Response:
No

8.
Question:
Hampton is 30 minutes from Norfolk International Airport.  Would you consider this a large enough airport?

Response:  
Yes, please submit your package.

<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Governments Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a man portable (dismounted) CREW (3.1) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 12 months to design, fabricate and test a dismounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately five months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on both the !  east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 man portable (dismounted) CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.     The draft and final RFP will be published on FEDBIZOPS.  Interested Offerors should watch FEDBIZOPS for the release of the RFP.  Requests for a RFP should not be submitted to the points of contact (POCs) listed in this Synopsis.  Only questions pertaining to the Sysnopsis should be submitted to the POCs

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  This synopsis is issued for information and planning purposes only.  The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this source sought notice.    

The Air Force is conducting market research to determine capability and interest of commercial firms in performing the Aerial Delivery function at Charleston AFB, SC; Dyess AFB, TX (Abilene area); McChord AFB, WA (Tacoma area); and Pope AFB, NC (Fayetteville area).  The following are basic performance requirements for the Aerial Delivery function: (1) Rig and prepare aerial delivery loads; (2) Inspect, clean, store, repair, and pack cargo/extraction parachutes; (3) Drop Zone (DZ) recovery; (4) Participation in airdrop malfunction investigations; and (5) Onload/Offload aircraft.  There are approximately 93 Government personnel overall performing the work at these four locations.  

Request interested contractors submit a capability package to include the following information:  (1)  Name and address of company; (2) Business Size (Large, Small, disadvantaged, HUBZone, or women owned, etc); (3) Company Point of Contact to include telephone number, fax number and e-mail address; (4) Contract references relating to Aerial Delivery Flight Services to include: Contract Number; agency supported, whether or not contractor was a prime or a subcontractor, period of performance, original contract value, final or current contract value, technical monitor and phone/fax number, POC with current phone/fax number, and a brief description of the effort; and (5)  Information demonstrating the company?s ability to perform aerial delivery services as described above.   Please limit the capability package to 20 pages.  Additionally, the Government is interested in determining the practices of firms engaged in producing, distributing, and supporting aerial delivery services such as terms of warranties, buyer financing, maintenance and packaging, marking, and quality control/assurance.  Your submission must be clear, concise, and complete and submitted by COB 31 Oct 06 via e-mail to rickey.mabry@scott.af.mil.

It is anticipated that the period of performance will be a basic year plus four one-year option periods.  For purposes of this synopsis the small business size standard is $6M and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190.  

The Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) announced an initial performance decision for the Command-wide Aerial Delivery function.  Competition between the Agency Cost Estimate (ACE) and the cost of private sector performance determined contract performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  

On 20 June 06, HQ USAF/A1MS approved AMC?s request to conduct a Streamlined Competition.  In accordance with Air Force policy, the study must reach a performance decision, to retain in-house or convert to contract, within 90 days from the public announcement date of 21 Jun 06.  During this 90-day period the Government conducted market research to develop an estimated contract price.  This estimated contract price was then compared to the ACE in order to determine the most cost efficient method of operation.  Again, this comparison deemed contractor performance more cost efficient.  However, before a contract can be awarded, the Government must verify via typical acquisition procedures that contractor costs are indeed cheaper than the Government?s ACE.  If the contract price is higher, the solicitation will be cancelled and the military authorizations converted to civilian for Most Efficient Organization (MEO) performance.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-GSV07PD0003
<RESPDATE>102706

<CONTACT>Robert Corey, Contracting Officer, Phone 202 501-1797, Fax 202 501-4281, Email robert.corey@gsa.gov
<DESC>Request for Information and Sources Sought:  The purpose of this public posting by the General Services Administration (GSA) is to provide all Federal departments and agencies, and our industry partners with an opportunity to comment on our draft requirements for multi-channel contact center services. This announcement is also designed to assist GSA in making a "set-aside for small business"determination as required by FAR 19.5.

Background:  Over the past three years, the GSA has been responsible for implementing and maintaining the USA Services E-Gov initiative. The objective of this initiative is to provide high quality, cost-effective contact center solutions for Federal departments and agencies, and to provide these services in a manner that meets the immediate needs of these Federal customers. To support this initiative, GSA has developed a requirement to provide a full range of multi-channel contact center solutions.  The scope of this work involves providing a wide range of automated and attended information services through multiple communications channels, including:  telephone, e-mail, the internet, facsimile and postal mail. The scope of this work is intended to support all Federal departments and agencies that operate programs which require the support of contact center services.  Through the award of multiple, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts for multi-channel contact center solutions, GSA fully intends to leverage its extensive experience and anticipated requirements into a program that allows other Federal departments and agencies to identify and process their contact center services faster, smarter and at a far lower overall costs than they otherwise would be able to do through their own resources.

Services:  Attached draft documents will provide you with our current thinking on the pricing schedule and the services that will be provided under this requirement. These documents call for the contractors to: (i) provide a wide range of automated and customer support services, using multiple communication channels, to respond to inquiries about Federal government programs, policies, information sources, and agencies from the general public, Congressional offices, business and professional communities, academia, government offices, and electronic and print media. The multiple communication channels include telephone, e-mail, the internet, facsimile, postal mail and other media as appropriate; (ii) provide and maintain all required facilities, equipment, software, supplies, and services, to support the automated and customer support services and technical and management functions; (iii) provide sufficient qualified personnel to support all automated and customer support services and to perform all required technical and management functions; (iv) provide solutions that fully comply with federal information system security requirements; (v) provide services that are fully accessible by individuals with disabilities as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998; (vi) perform all technical and management functions needed to plan, design, implement, operate, and manage these services.  To include: site management, program management, technology management, information systems security, content and knowledge management, contact/case management, relationship management, and customer satisfaction survey support; (vi) provide special project support needed to analyze, plan, design, implement, operate and manage special customer support services that may be needed to meet the diverse needs of the Government; and (vii) conduct public outreach and advertising programs which include publishing telephone numbers in telephone directories for agency-specified service areas. In performing this requirement the contractor will provide (i) all necessary personnel, training, supervision, administrative support and management; (ii) all facilities, supplies, equipment and IT hardware and services; (iii) all telecommunications except that provided by the Government, (iv) all software and research and reference materials except those provided by the Government; (v) current information to the public according to Government direction; and (vi) a quality control program.  The contractor will be able to perform the work requirements of their contract at one work site within the contigious 48 states, or at multiple work sites within the contigious 48 states.     

Small Business Set-Aside Determination:  Firms that qualify as a Small Business or a Small-Disadvantaged Business under the size standard for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 519190, Other Information Services, ($6.0 million in annual revenue) are highly encouraged to write to the Contracting Officer with information attesting to their ability to perform the required work. This notification can be up to five (5) pages in length and should include a detailed description of the firm?s capability to provide all services within the scope of work.  The minimum experience requirements for this project are as follows: (i) three years general experience in providing information and referral services with monthly work volumes handled by agents of no less than 100,000 telephone inquiries and 7,500 e-mail inquiries per month, (ii) one year of specialized experience in providing information services in a multi-media environment, including the use of telephone, facsimile, e-mail, and web-based media; (iii) three years of experience in providing information services in a multi-language environment; and (iv) at least two years specialized experience in handling case management in an information and referral service. All of this experience stated above must have been gained with within five years from the date of award of this requirement. The capability statement can be sent via e-mail to bob.corey@gsa.gov, or mailed to Robert H. Corey at the street address shown above and should be sent in sufficient time to arrive within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this posting.

Comments:  Since a small business set-aside determination has not yet been made, we are encouraging all potential offerors, both large and small, and other interested parties to provide comments, concerns or suggestions you may have concerning this draft.  Federal respondents are encouraged to visualize their own future needs, asking themselves if they had a need for contact center services would their requirements be met by this service. In order to have your comments fully considered in the development of this requirement, please provide them by e-mail to the GSA Contracting Officer at:  bob.corey@gsa.gov , arrive within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this posting.*****

<ARCHDATE>12232006

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY. Requests for copies of solicitation will not receive a response. The Joint Program Executive Officer for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) has a requirement for a Joint Material Decontamination System (JMD  S) for use throughout the, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy to provide the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological warfare agents from sensitive equipment and platform interiors without degradation of the equipment in an  immediate, operational and thorough environment.. Sensitive equipment is high value or low density electronic or optic equipment that cannot be decontaminated using existing means without degradation of their functions.     Examples of critical sensitive equipment are laptops, night vision goggles, and the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System.     Platform interiors refers to the interior decontamination of tactical platforms such as personnel carriers and small aircraft such as a single seat fighter plane, as well     as large platform interior decontamination such as interiors of buildings, ships and large aircraft, e.g., cargo aircraft.     The decontaminant portion of the technology will utilize a decontaminant in a gaseous phase with proven effectiveness  against a bro ad spectrum of chemical and biological agents to include VX, GD, and HD, spores, vegetative bacteria and viruses.     The decontaminant formulation will not leave a residue requiring rinsing.     The decontaminant will be compatible with mat erials consistent wit h those found in sensitive equipment and platform interiors.     The system hardware will utilize commercially available components such as a pump, generator and environmental control that will be integrated to form the JMDS hardware system.     The hardware will convert the decontaminant from a liquid to a vapor.     The vapor will be pumped into an enclosure to fumigate/decontaminate the equipment.     The hardware will maintain conditions inside the enclosure to keep the decontamina nt in a vaporous state.     The decontaminant will be recycled to circulate the vapor throughout the enclosure. The following Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are applicable to this requirement and are provided for information purposes only. The format is  title of KPP, Developmental Threshold (DT) and Developmental Objective (DO). KPP 1- Efficacy, Thorough Decontamination.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yakima Field Office, Yakima WA is seeking information on small manufacturers / suppliers of belting material. As per NAICS 326220 Rubber and Plastics Hoses and Belting Manufacturing, SBA size Standard of 500 employees. The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office procured the Series S1800 belting material from Intralox Corp in 2003 based on Intralox Corp, being the only acceptable manufacturer at that time. In no way is the US Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office endorsing the Intralox S1800 belting  for use in fish screening devices. This announcement / Request for Information is for the sole purpose of seeking vendors that may be capable of supplying an acceptable material on a competitive market. Based on the following information, if you feel you can provide a suitable product, or have any questions regarding the technical use of the product, please contact the Contracting Officer before close of business Wednesday November 12, 2006. Connie Morgan, Contracting Officer US Bureau of reclamation, UCAO Yakima WA 98901 509-575-5848 ext 241 cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov You may be asked to provide a sample of your product upon the request of the Contracting Officer Background  information  Fish screening devices are used to prevent fish from being flushed into and through irrigation diversions, suction pumps and hydropower turbines. National Marines Fisheries / NOAA sets the criteria as to how these systems are to be engineered, constructed and maintained. State Programs (Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington) as well as Federal Agencies throughout the Pacific Northwest are held to these criteria when impact is apparent on anadromous and salmonid species within a stream that is listed as endangered or threatened. Reclamation maintains three different types of fish screens. They are: Rotary drum Fixed Plate  Traveling Belt Although rotary type screens are most prevalent throughout the Northwest, there are situations where the performance of fixed plate and traveling belt screens are used. When pumps are installed for 'pumping plant' situations the most often used screening device is the traveling belt screen. A traveling belt screen is similar to the conveyer belt type operation used in shipping plants, warehouses and food processing plants. In these applications the conveyor belt operates on a horizontal plane whereas, a traveling belt screen operates on a vertical plane. The screen travels around a frame, therefore blocking the path of fish that may be sucked into the pumping equipment. Due to the geographical nature of Central Washington State, many sites pose numerous problems to the use of screens due to the silt problem associated with the approach velocity as well as the materials that are carried through the stream. Constant silt moving through out the system builds up at the intake of the screen ( a normal problem since this is where water is being pumped from, thus creating a velocity that draws these particles into the system). The abrasive effect of silt on mechanical components creates problems of deterioration and components wear out frequently, making maintenance not only frequent but costly. The silt problem presides on numerous sites not only in the Yakima Basin but in all areas of the Pacific Northwest. Screen programs have been in search of a material that would withstand this abuse for the past 10-15 years.  Even though fish screen / passage is not a new concept with salmonid / anadromous species, it was not until NMFS / NOAA  set specific standards in the 1980's that gave way for the commercial market to experiment with materials that would meet this criteria. This research has made available stainless steel fabrics and coverings that are the most commonly used material, but due to silt and abrasive factors there was a need for a better product. The only known manufacturer in 2001 to the present date has been  Intralox Corp., New Orleans LA that have created a product that meets the demands and criteria of vertical screen belting material. Intralox Corp. has  demonstrated why a plastic / resin type of material  as well as a sprocket system to move the belting is the preferred material and method for traveling belt screens in the Pacific Northwest. In the past the mechanics on traveling belt screens was the basic frame with motor driven sprockets that carried the belting around the frame. Due to debris and high water velocity the belting would dislodge itself from the frame and sprockets causing the screen to non functional down time could be from several hours to several days depending on the damage to the belting. The Intralox product is a system of interlocking belting with numerous sprockets. Each sprocket includes 'tracking' teeth located around the perimeter of a drive sprocket, as well as a plurality of recesses for receiving the tooth members located on the modules so as to provide the necessary force to drive the belt. This particular drive technique of the heavy duty conveyor belt is what makes this system popular among Screen programs. The positioning of the sprockets is important with this system as well. It is, more often than not, that a belt should track; it should not slide from side to side such that the edges of the belt rub or wear against the conveyor belt support structure. The configurations of the sprocket teeth on the Intralox system prevent this sliding effect, thus resulting in less wear and less repair / replacement of components and material. Like most, if not all modular conveyer systems, the units of the belting are held together by pivot rods. To keep the pivot rods from coming out, enlarged areas or 'heads' are usually formed on each end of the rod which extends across the width of the belt. Consequently when a broken module has to be replaced or other changes to the belt, a 'head' on one end of the rod must be cut off and the rod removed. After the repair is completed, a new rod is then inserted to hold the modules together and 'heads' are then formed on both ends. The Intralox system uses a single headed rod between interlocking  pieces of belting, therefore it is not necessary to include a head on the other end of the pivot rod to prevent the rod from coming out of the linked ends. In field maintenance and repair situations this system configuration would be a valuable labor cost reducing strategy.  In 2001 Intralox introduced a product that met NMFS criteria. Not to say that other companies didn't produce the same type of product but only Intralox at that time met the flow guidelines. The actual configuration /opening of the material met criteria in regards to salmonid emergent size as well as appropriate CFS flow. However, the overall percent of open surface (32%), to meet appropriate CFS flow did not meet criteria for water users. The following Fish Screen criteria is provide so that a proposed manufacturer / supplier is made aware of the circumstance and nature of the product required to meet NMFS guidelines, only the portion of the NMFS requirements needed in this proposed acquisition is listed below. JUVENILE FISH SCREEN CRITERIA Developed by  National Marine Fisheries Service  Environmental & Technical Services Division  Portland, Oregon  Revised February 16, 1995  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:  This document provides guidelines and criteria to be utilized in the development of functional designs of downstream migrant fish passage facilities for hydroelectric, irrigation, and other water withdrawal projects. This material has been prepared by the National Marine Fisheries  Service (NMFS) as a direct result of responsibilities for prescribing fish ways (including fish screen and bypass systems) under Section 18 of the Federal Power Act, administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This material is also applicable for projects  that are undergoing consultation with the NMFS, pursuant to responsibilities for protecting fish under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Since these guidelines and criteria are general in nature, there may be cases where site constraints or extenuating circumstances dictate that certain criteria   be waived or modified.  Conversely, where there is a need to provide additional protection for fish, site-specific criteria  may be added. These circumstances will be considered by NMFS on a project-by-project basis.  In designing an effective fish screen facility, the swimming ability of the fish is a primary consideration. Research has shown that swimming ability of  various fish   may depend upon a number of factors relating to the physiology of the fish , including species, size, duration of  swimming time required, behavioral aspects, migrational stage, physical condition and others, in addition to water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentrations, water temperature, lighting conditions, and others. For this reason, screen  criteria must be expressed in general  terms.  To minimize risks to anadromous fish at some locations, the NMFS may require investigation (by the project sponsors) of important and poorly defined site-specific variables that are deemed critical to development of the screen  and bypass design. This investigation may include factors  such as fish behavioral response to hydraulic conditions, weather conditions (ice, wind, flooding, etc.), river stage-discharge relationships, seasonal operational variability, potential for sediment  and debris problems, resident fish populations, potential for creating predation opportunity, and other information. The size of salmonids present at a potential  screen site usually is not known,  and can change from year to year based on flow and temperature conditions. Thus, adequate data  to describe the size-time relationship requires substantial sampling efforts over a number of years. The NMFS will assume that fry-sized salmonids and low water temperatures are present at all sites and apply the appropriate criteria  listed below, unless adequate biological investigation  proves otherwise. The burden-of-proof is the responsibility of the owner of the  screen facility.  Screen Face Material     Fry criteria: 	a. Perforated plate: screen openings shall not exceed 3/32 or 0.0938 	inches (2.38 mm).  	b. Profile bar screen : The narrowest dimension in the screen  openings 	shall not exceed 0.0689 inches (1.75 mm) in the narrow direction.  	c. Woven wire screen: screen openings shall not exceed 3/32 or 0.0938 	inches (2.38 mm) in the  	narrow direction (example: 6-14 mesh).  	d. Screen material shall provide a minimum of 27% open area.  	e.. The screen material shall be corrosion resistant and sufficiently durable 	to maintain a smooth  Operations and Maintenance  	a. Fish screens shall be automatically cleaned as frequently as necessary 	to prevent accumulation of debris. The cleaning system and protocol must 	be effective, reliable, and satisfactory to the NMFS. Proven cleaning 	technologies are preferred.  	b. Open channel intakes shall include a trash rack in the screen facility 	design which shall be kept free of debris. In certain cases, a satisfactory 	profile bar screen design can substitute for a trash rack.  	c. The head differential to trigger screen cleaning for intermittent type 	cleaning systems shall be a maximum of 0.1 feet (0.03 m) or as agreed to 	by the NMFS.  Based on the above criteria from NMFS and 20 years of 'in field' maintenance, Reclamation has determined that the needed material must have the following characteristics: 1.  Profile type bar screen: The narrowest dimension in the screen openings shall not exceed 0.0689 inches (1.75 mm) in the narrow direction.  2. Material shall be manufactured to withstand extreme temperature differences of -20 through 110 Fahrenheit. 3. Material openings shall be configured such that the material, once applied to the vertical structure is 'self cleaning' by way of the hydrologic force. 4. Material shall be dense in nature to withstand the hydrologic force velocities. 5. Material shall be dense in nature / impact and corrosion resistant, to withstand silts, sands, small aggregates and debris. 6. Material shall contain a UV protection to ensure longevity in continuous day light conditions. 7. Belting shall be configured in such a way to eliminate dismantle of the entire belt or structure for any type of repair. 8. Belting shall be configured in such a way that maintenance costs are kept to a  minimum. If you feel you can provide a suitable product, or have any questions regarding the technical use of the product, please contact the Contracting Officer before close of business Wednesday November 12, 2006.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential small business sources that could function as the prime contractor for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contract.  Interested parties are hereby requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).
NAVAIR deployed its enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, Sigma, in October 2002 and has been in the operations and support (O&S) phase of the program since that time.  PMA 203 provides functional O&S support for the Sigma ERP deployed solution at NAVAIR under the guidance of a Government/integrator team.  O&S tasks are typically accomplished through integrated product or project teams, comprised of Government and contractor personnel, supporting business areas such as financial, procurement, human resources, and other elements of the NAVAIR Sigma solution. Sigma is scheduled to transition to Navy ERP in October 2007 with full retirement in December 2007.  As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, NAVAIR will establish a Business Office that will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise and provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters. 

This contract will provide support for continued O&S performance of the Sigma system, NAVAIR Navy ERP implementation efforts, and the establishment of the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The Government views these primary tasks as a three-phased approach of distinct yet interrelated efforts resulting in an overlap of one task area within the next.  Support areas required for each effort is outlined below:
	
	1) Sigma Operations and Support
The goal of this phase is to provide continued sustainment levels of operational support through close-out of the Sigma ERP system.  In performance of this phase, the contractor shall support NAVAIR business processes as deployed in Sigma, maintain data integrity of the system, identify and resolve any issues, and complete requirements for external mandates.  O&S will continue to be fully operational up until one month after Navy ERP Go-Live with a final Annual Close for FY07 conducted within the operational period.  In this phase, the contractor shall perform services in areas such as testing, configuration management, requirements management, functional support, analysis, and role management under the guidance of the government/integrator team.  Mandated system changes and deficiencies will require analysis, requirements and solution development, testing and implementation.  The contractor shall also support the Customer Support Center (CSC) which provides services to NAVAIR by providing communications and liaison between Sigma ERP and internal and external customers and organizations and by disseminating information regarding Sigma ERP via multiple venues.   The CSC also supports resolution of customer issues through its Help Desk and Role Management activities, updating of ERP website information, and compiling metrics to gauge.

2) NAVAIR Navy ERP Implementation
The goal of this phase is to serve as the focal point for successful Navy ERP Implementation at NAVAIR.  To achieve this goal, support shall be required for the transition from the Sigma ERP System to the Navy ERP system in the areas of change management, data management, test support, and training support across all SAP modules including  FI, FM, CO, MM, PS, SD, HR, WF, IM, AM and BW.  Implementation support is currently on-going and will continue through complete Sigma phase out which is projected to be three months after Navy ERP Go-Live. 

3) NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office
	As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, the primary NAVAIR interaction with Navy ERP regarding their deployed NAVAIR solution will be through the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The goal of the Business Office will be to serve as the NAVAIR center of excellence for Navy ERP business operations and functional process sustainment.  Additionally, the Business Office will minimize impact of Navy ERP deployment and implementation on current and new users.  The Business Office will provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters, ensure that business process and technical areas are in sync, and will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise.  All NAVAIR requirements for Navy ERP, to include deficiencies, will be processed and prioritized through this organization to represent the NAVAIR Process Owner needs.  The Business Office will be responsible for key stakeholder coordination, business and functional process management, deficiency identification, data management and reporting, user and role management, sustainment training management, customer advocacy, and liaison with the Navy ERP Program Management Office (PMO).  In addition, the Business Office will provide strategic recommendations to the NAVAIR leadership on the health, business operations, and recommendations for improvement based on the data obtained from the Navy ERP system.  The NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office will officially stand up at Navy ERP Go-Live which is projected for 1 October 2007 and remain in effect indefinitely.  The contractor shall support the following efforts: testing, quality assurance, training, data management, reporting, system deficiency recognition and resolution, requirements management, business Process Owner support and project management support.  The contractor shall also provide customer support for NAVAIR.
Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  The Government will not be responsible for SOC preparation costs.  Submissions should be electronically in a MS Office compatible format to yarinee.tafur@navy.mil.  Note that submissions will not be returned.  Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 27 Oct 2006.

<DESC>Request for Information and Sources Sought:  The purpose of this public posting by the General Services Administration (GSA) is to provide all Federal departments and agencies, and our industry partners with an opportunity to comment on our draft requirements for multi-channel contact center services. This announcement is also designed to assist GSA in making a ?set-aside for small business? determination as required by FAR 19.5.

Background:  Over the past three years, the GSA has been responsible for implementing and maintaining the USA Services E-Gov initiative.  The objective of this initiative is to provide high quality, cost-effective contact center solutions for Federal departments and agencies, and to provide these services in a manner that meets the immediate needs of these Federal customers.  To support this initiative, GSA has developed a requirement to provide a full range of multi-channel contact center solutions.  The scope of this work involves providing a wide range of automated and attended information services through multiple communications channels, including:  telephone, e-mail, the internet, facsimile and postal mail. The scope of this work is intended to support all Federal departments and agencies that operate programs which require the support of contact center services.  Through the award of multiple, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts for multi-channel contact center solutions, GSA fully intends to leverage its extensive experience and anticipated requirements into a program that allows other Federal departments and agencies to identify and process their contact center services faster, smarter and at a far lower overall costs than they otherwise would be able to do through their own resources.

Services:  Attached draft documents will provide you with our current thinking on the pricing schedule and the services that will be provided under this requirement.  These documents call for the contractors to:  (i) provide a wide range of automated and customer support services, using multiple communication channels, to respond to inquiries about Federal government programs, policies, information sources, and agencies from the general public, Congressional offices, business and professional communities, academia, government offices, and electronic and print media.     The multiple communication channels include telephone, e-mail, the internet, facsimile, postal mail and other media as appropriate; (ii) provide and maintain all required facilities, equipment, software, supplies, and services, to support the automated and customer support services and technical and management functions; (iii) provide sufficient qualified personnel to support all automated and customer support services and to perform all required technical and management functions; (iv) provide solutions that fully comply with federal information system security requirements; (v) provide services that are fully accessible by individuals with disabilities as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998; (vi) perform all technical and management functions needed to plan, design, implement, operate, and manage these services.  To include: site management, program management, technology management, information systems security, content and knowledge management, contact/case management, relationship management, and customer satisfaction survey support; (vi) provide special project support needed to analyze, plan, design, implement, operate and manage special customer support services that may be needed to meet the diverse needs of the Government; and (vii) conduct public outreach and advertising programs which include publishing telephone numbers in telephone directories for agency-specified service areas.  In performing this requirement the contractor will provide (i) all necessary personnel, training, supervision, administrative support and management; (ii) all facilities, supplies, equipment and IT hardware and services; (iii) all telecommunications except that provided by the Government, (iv) all software and research and reference materials except those provided by the Government; (v) current information to the public according to Government direction; and (vi) a quality control program.  The contractor will be able to perform the work requirements of their contract at one work site within the contigious 48 states, or at multiple work sites within the contigious 48 states.     

Small Business Set-Aside Determination:  Firms that qualify as a Small Business or a Small-Disadvantaged Business under the size standard for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 519190, Other Information Services, ($6.0 million in annual revenue) are highly encouraged to write to the Contracting Officer with information attesting to their ability to perform the required work. This notification can be up to five (5) pages in length and should include a detailed description of the firm?s capability to provide all services within the scope of work.  The minimum experience requirements for this project are as follows: (i) three years general experience in providing information and referral services with monthly work volumes handled by agents of no less than 100,000 telephone inquiries and 7,500 e-mail inquiries per month, (ii) one year of specialized experience in providing information services in a multi-media environment, including the use of telephone, facsimile, e-mail, and web-based media; (iii) three years of experience in providing information services in a multi-language environment; and (iv) at least two years specialized experience in handling case management in an information and referral service. All of this experience stated above must have been gained with within five years from the date of award of this requirement. The capability statement can be sent via e-mail to bob.corey@gsa.gov, or mailed to Robert H. Corey at the street address shown above and should be sent in sufficient time to arrive within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this posting.

Comments:  Since a small business set-aside determination has not yet been made, we are encouraging all potential offerors, both large and small, and other interested parties to provide comments, concerns or suggestions you may have concerning this draft.  Federal respondents are encouraged to visualize their own future needs, asking themselves if they had a need for contact center services would their requirements be met by this service.

<DESC>Sources Sought
Dynamics of Economic Well-being Systems (DEWS)


The U.S. Census Bureau has a requirement for the new Dynamics of Economic Well-being Systems (DEWS).

Background

The comprehensive information about individual and household income and program participation collected by the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is used by federal agencies to evaluate programs and assess need.  A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the effectiveness of government programs and to analyze the impact of options for modifying them.  

The SIPP?s longitudinal design has many advantages, but imposes considerable burden on respondents and makes review and data processing difficult and time consuming.  These constraints coupled with substantial shortfalls in the FY 2007 President?s budget for the Census Bureau?s Current Demographic Statistics subactivity prompted Census Bureau executive managers to initiate a major re-engineering of the current SIPP program.

The re-engineered system, to be known as the dynamics of economic well-being system (DEWS), is expected to reduce respondent burden and attrition and deliver data on a timely basis.  The data collection instrument for the new system will be a Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) instrument along with an electronic Event History Calendar (EHC) to obtain transition estimates for items such as labor force participation, periods of unemployment, receipt of public assistance (TANF, WIC, Food Stamps, etc), and health insurance coverage

Purpose

Documented research has shown that an EHC successfully reduces seam bias and improves recall for these types of events.  The DEWS is the first Census Bureau initiative involving the development and integration of an electronic EHC with our existing case management systems.  Therefore, it is critical that we obtain expert guidance concerning the appropriate methodology. 

Scope

The DEWS would have to provide an electronic event history calendar where the EHC interacts with both a BLAISE instrument and a Regional Office Survey Control (ROSC)/Case Management System (this is how cases are sent to the Regional Offices and assigned for interviewing and how completed cases are checked into the system and the data transferred back to Headquarters.





Period of Performance

All work required hereunder, including preparation, submission, review of any and all reports, shall be completed within the Base Period of twelve (12) calendar months after the effective date of the award.

Place of Performance

To Be Determined

Objectives

The objective of this requirement is to have the contractor do the following:

?	Conduct a 2-day workshop (place to be determined jointly by Census Bureau and contracting staff) discussing the methodology and implications of using an electronic EHC versus a standard CAPI instrument as well as to address specific questions/issues related to the design/development of the data collection instrument and post-data collection processing system for the DEWS.

?	Commission analytic paper(s) (number of papers to be determined jointly by the Census Bureau and contracting staff) addressing data quality topics related to EHCs including (but not limited to):  assessment of sample attrition, robustness of the resulting estimates (including variance), seam bias, using an EHC for interviewing low-income households with turbulent life-events, evaluation of recall periods (particularly 6 month and 12 month) for these events, and any other relevant EHC topics as they relate to the DEWS.

Constraints

?	Due to the importance of these data to policy makers, we are trying to minimize the data gap that will result from the discontinuation of the SIPP and the implementation of the DEWS.  The DEWS is slated to be in the field in early 2009.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit Technical Capability Statements.  The Government will consider all statements received within 10 days after date of publication of this Sources Sought.  Submit all Technical Capability Statements to the following email address:  maxine.r.hodges@census.gov. or contact (301) 763-3203.

<SUBJECT>A--CON-X SCIENCE ENHANCEMENT PACKAGE
<DESC>NASA GSFC is hereby soliciting concepts for its Con-X mission under a streamlined mission design. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This notice is a call for white papers.  This notice is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any review of the submitted information. Con-X is a flagship mission in NASAs Beyond Einstein program.	Using high-throughput x-ray spectroscopy, Con-X will investigate black holes and General Relativity, the formation of large scale structure, galaxy formation and cosmic feedback processes, supernova remnants, stellar coronae, neutron stars, and other high energy processes in a cosmic setting.  Information on the Con-X mission can be found at       http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov     .   To substantially reduce mission costs, the Con-X project is studying a streamlined mission design that can be launched on a single Atlas V 551 launch vehicle. The basic payload of this implementation approach consists of a set of Spectroscopy X-ray Telescope (SXT) mirrors, each with an X-ray Microcalorimeter Spectrometer (XMS) at its focus.  This instrumentation satisfies the Con-X mission throughput and spectral resolution requirements from 0.6 to 10 keV.  This notice calls for white papers containing concepts for Science Enhancement Packages (SEP) to extend this performance so as to achieve the full Con-X science objectives.	Specifically, SEP concepts should provide increased spectral resolution at low energies (&lt; 0.6 keV) to maintain a resolving power of R &gt; 300, and/or additional throughput at high energies (&gt;10 keV).  In the reference Con-X mission configuration (launched on a single Delta IVH), these capabilities are provided by Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) and Hard X-ray Telescopes (HXT).  A maximum of 100kg and $100M have nominally been allocated for implementing the SEP.  Proposed SEP concepts can involve both new instrumentation, or modifications to the existing XMS and/or the SXT mirror designs.  New instrumentation must fit within the available envelope.  Preliminary information on the Con-X observatory configuration and estimated capabilities for the Single Atlas V launch can be found at https://conxproj.gsfc.nasa.gov/business/Con-X_RFI.htm. The concepts submitted in response to this call may be used by the project for mission study purposes.  The project may use one or more SEP concepts as part of the planning and development of this single Atlas V launch vehicle approach as a new mission reference design.  No Government funds are available for this phase of the SEP.  Guidelines 1.	Responses should address SEP concepts that provide high energy coverage and/or high spectral resolution at low energies.  Papers should include the following elements: 	Science -	Description of the SEP science capabilities and how it augments the capabilities provided by the basic payload to achieve the Con-X science objectives 	Technical -	Description of the overall SEP concept, the associated technology, and how it would interface with or modify the basic payload or mission concept -	Estimated mass, power and dollar cost as they relate to the maximums given above. -	Brief discussion of any significant impact on the SEP concept of modifying the basic payload from 4 SXTs to 3 SXTs. 	Performance -	Estimated performance of the SEP concept, including the bandpass, efficiency, spectral resolution, and angular resolution as appropriate -	Any estimated reduction in capability of the basic payload due to implementation of the SEP concept  	Technology Readiness  -	Status of the technology (including Technology Readiness Level, or TRL) needed to implement the SEP concept  -	Overview of major steps required to achieve TRL 6 for the proposed SEP 2.	Submissions must be limited to no more than 10 pages (8.5 x 11 inch) single sided.	Figures, tables and other supplementary material must be included within the page limit.	 3.	Respondents are invited to present their SEP concepts at an open workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion and input from the community and from the Con-X Facility Science Team.  The workshop will be held on 18 December, in conjunction with the Con-X Facility Science Team meeting scheduled for the 19th and 20th of December.   Further details will be posted at https://conxproj.gsfc.nasa.gov/business/Con-X_RFI.htm. 4.	Respondents should not include any information that is limited or restricted.  By submitting information in response to this notice, submitters of such information thereby consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any U.S. Government or non-U.S. Government entity to which NASA releases and disseminates the information for review.  Review teams may be comprised of U.S. Government personnel from NASA and/or other U.S. Government agencies.  Moreover, review teams may include third parties, such as contractor personnel who support NASA.

<SUBJECT>--Final RFP W9113M-06-R-0017, Integrated Test and Analysis Contract (ITAC)
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT) requires an integration contractor team to plan, organize and coordinate operations/tests/analyses with comprehensive, widely distributed experimental w  eapons systems, or credible representations thereof, such as Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense hardware/element labs, early warning radars, sea-based missile defense elements, mid and lower tier missile defense elements, or representative element sim u lations; and/or other equipment of interest, such as communications network hardware/simulation, command and control, and/or threat systems data.     Combinations may include, but are not limited to items such as weapons system Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL ) lab oratories, Software-in-the-Loop (SWIL), detailed (up to and including detailed engineering level) modeling and simulation (M&S) products, trustworthy databases reflecting detailed weapon system operations, threat system representations and /or any ot her as set required, for integrated test and analysis experiments.       Initial emphasis is expected by SMDC/ARSTRAT to be placed upon but not be limited to all varieties of missile defense operations (and related offensive operations) against threats in all phases of operational envelopes. Test and analysis experimental configurations are customer driven in accordance with directly stated objectives or derived from senior leadership expectations.     To perform this scope of work (SOW), SMDC/ARSTRAT and t he ITAC contra ctor shall seek out partnerships with DoD and other US Government organizations (and their lead contractor organizations) to obtain the requisite capabilities.     Task orders will be issued by the SMDC/ARSTRAT to accomplish the ITAC require ments.     Several US Government supported efforts are expected to be integrated into the performance of this contract through the use of directed subcontractors to the ITAC prime contractor. Each present or future Directed subcontractor is precluded from participating as a me mber of the prime team.     The Missile Defense System Exerciser (MDSE) developed by Teledyne Brown Engineering is expected to be heavily leveraged with the ITAC tasks, but the scope of ITAC is more comprehensive than just existing (c irca 2006) MDSE operation s.     Likewise, the Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense Embedded Test (ET) capability developed by the Boeing Company is expected to be leveraged along with the Integrated System Test Capability (ISTC) resources and US Governm ent supported contractor radar laboratories operated by the Raytheon Company.  The NAICS code for this small business set-aside competition is 541710/1000 employees.     This acquisition is not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The final Request for Proposal (RFP) is located at the following USASMDC website: http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/ITAC.html.      NO PAPER COPIES OF THE FINAL RFP WILL BE PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE FINAL RFP IS POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.     Questions on the final RFP need to  be submitted by email or fax no later than Friday, 27 October 2006 to Ms. Nicole Meenen, Contracting Officer (nicole.meenen@smdc.army.mil, fax 256-955-4240) and Rhonda Brock (rhonda.brock@smdc.army.mil, fax 256-955-4240.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Factor 4 - Construction Safety

The Government desires to do business with only those firms that excel in safety performance.  This factor exists to emphasize the importance of safety in and around all construction sites and at the base where construction work is being performed.   This factor consists of two subfactors that (1) will evaluate specific aspects of the offerors construction safety program and (2) will evaluate the offeror's safety performance history by contacting references, including but not limited to clients, insurance agencies and subcontractors.  For purposes of this evaluation, Subfactor A is less important than Subfactor B.    

	Subfactor A:  Safety Program.  The offeror shall provide information that demonstrates a corporate commitment to construction safety by addressing the following:

Processes/Standard Operating Procedures
Management Involvement/Commitment
Employee participation and training

Other safety program innovations

Offerors shall not submit their Corporate Safety Plan to satisfy the response to this subfactor.  

	Subfactor B:  Safety Performance History.  The offeror shall describe all lost time construction accidents/mishaps that occurred on contracts over the past two years.  This information is required for the prime contractor and all subcontractors working on the jobsite. Your response shall address each of the following:

Date/location of occurrence and contract title
Actions taken following accident/mishap

The Government will contact references for the purpose of validating the information provided in response to this factor as well as obtaining further insight into each offeror's corporate safety philosophy.   The frequency and severity of events may have significant impact in the rating assigned to this factor.  The Government reserves the right to call any or all previous clients for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding your record of accidents and mishaps.

Factor 5a - Subcontracting History

Factor 5a is included to obtain the offerors history of subcontracting to Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, Historically underutilized small zone small businesses, women owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses, and historically black college and university/minority institutes.  

Factor 5a in Phase I and 5b found in Phase II are subfactors equal in importance to each other.  Factor 5b will be evaluated under Phase II and an overall rating for this factor will be assigned.  

Offerors must address the following in sufficient detail to allow proper evaluation and rating: 

1.	Provide SF-294 forms, "Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts?, for projects identified under technical factor 2, Relevant Experience (construction team).  If the referenced projects were not DOD procurements and an SF-294 was not required, provide any other documentation showing compliance with the utilization of Small Business firms in each noted category (e.g., Small, Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone Small, Veteran Owned Small, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions, if applicable).  Include the dollar value and percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to these entities.  If goals were not met on the referenced contracts, provide an explanation as to why.

PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform this contract successfully.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The relevancy and source of the information, context of data, and general trends in a contractor's performance shall be taken into consideration.  The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establishes a level of confidence or risk for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the relative standing of the offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.

By contacting references provided under Factors 1 and 2, the Government will evaluate the offerors past performance.  Offerors are authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective actions taken.  In investigating the contractor's past performance, the Government is not limited to the references submitted but may rely on other sources as well.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as well as fair and reasonable pricing.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror's record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management, and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror's record for reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. 

Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror's response will be taken into consideration.  A review of CCAS and ACAS may be performed.

PHASE II. EVALUATION FACTORS.  Please do not respond to Phase II factors at this time.  The following factors may be included Phase II.  The full text will be provided in the solicitation.  In Phase II: (1) the total of all Phase I and II technical/management factors; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Price, are considered equal in importance.

FACTOR 5b - Subcontracting Plan

FACTOR 6 - Design Solutions

PRICE  - Price will be evaluated during Phase II in terms of reasonableness based on a comparison of the Government Estimate and other offers received.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the below questions and responses.  

Question:  Is the figure of 50,000 lines for each qualified newspaper within the 92 judicial districts capable of delivering the announcements to the target audience, or is the requested cost of 50,000 lines total of all qualified newspapers combined for a single week of advertising?

Answer:  The 50,000 lines is the ATF estimate for a 12 month period for all seized property.

Question:  Based on the answer to the above question, confirm  that when advertisements are distributed to the qualified target newspapers, advertisements will be published at least once weekly for coverage in each of the 92 judicial districts at the same time with the same advertisement? 

Answer:  Yes.  The ad must run once a week for three consecutive weeks.

Question:  Because qualified newspapers are based on a certain number of PAID subscribers receiving the newspapers, does this mean that only one qualified newspaper within the targeted judicial district in which the seizure proceeding is brought can be utilized? 

Answer.  Any qualified newspaper that meets the legal requirement can be used.

Question:  Or can the advertisement be published in more than one (1) qualified newspaper at the same publishing period that might overlap geographical coverage and/or reach of target markets such as a multi-city local newspaper vs competing multi-city local newspaper or multi-city vs a state wide newspaper? 

Answer:  Yes.
