<DESC>TRIDENT PEAK DIVISION FENCE MAINTENANCE - WINNEMUCCA, NV BLM

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Nevada State Office has a requirement for the maintenance/construction of approximately 5.5 miles of the Trident Peak Division Fence with government furnished materials.  The fence is old, fire damaged, and has sections that will need replaced. Contractor will be furnishing labor, equipment, and supplies except for specified Government furnished property, to maintain livestock fence, associated gates and drainage crossings. Contractor shall maintain existing fence to current BLM standard in accordance with the attached specifications and drawings. Any old fence wire and posts removed shall become the property of the contractor and must be removed off public lands.  

The BLM anticipates issuing a single firm fixed price award from this solicitation.  The project is located in Humboldt County in Nevada. Davis Bacon Act (DBA) is applicable and the appropriate DBA Wage Decision is attached.  See attached Specifications, Drawings, and Maps for complete details of the project. It is expected the contractor would be available to start work following award and complete the project before weather becomes an issue.

NAICS: 238990 All Other Specialty Trade Contractors, Size Standard: $15.0M, 100% Set-Aside for Small Business.  

In accordance with FAR 36.204 the Disclosure of the Magnitude of this construction project is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00. Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 3132, construction contracts greater than $35,000, but not greater than $150,000.00 will require Payment Protection at 100% of the contract value. 

NOTE: A formal site visit will NOT be offered. Interested vendors can access the site at their own convenience.  Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.  

As noted in the Statement of Work, access to this project site is Moderately Difficult. Moderately Difficult terrain is described as mountainous areas with portions of the fence line inaccessible with a high clearance four-wheel drive vehicle. Soil conditions are generally sandy, silty, or clay with rock out crops in the higher elevations. During favorable weather conditions, the government estimates that access may be accomplished with high clearance four-wheel drive vehicles up to 40% of the entire fence line. Access for the remaining 60% of fence line may require alternative means such as: ATV/UTV, foot travel, horses, or pack animals. Offerors are encouraged to visit the site before submitting a quote.  No adjustments will be made to the contract after award due to site access or conditions.

<p>Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) No. 19AQMM-18-N-0052</p>
<p>II. Disclaimer:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought/RFI for Planning Purposes Only and is not a notice of solicitation issuance. Responses to this Sources Sought/RFI are strictly voluntary and will not affect any respondent's ability to submit an offer if, and when, a Request for Proposal (RFP) is released. There is NO bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the government for direct or indirect costs, or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.

<p>III. Synopsis:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's (DoS), Bureau Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), is seeking information pertaining to potential sources interested in, and capable of, providing services under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220 for its newly combined Forced Entry/Ballistic Resistant (FE/BR) and Anti-Ram Gates &amp; Barriers (ARGB) Program. The primary focus of the work will involve the installation, repair, maintenance and replacement of FE/BR and ARGB products - e.g., doors, windows, opaque panels, glazing panels vault doors, crash fence systems, shallow mount bollards, wedge barriers, vertical lift barriers, multi-purpose entry drop-arms and anti-ram crash gates - that may include, but is not limited to, electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, and structural, blast, fire life-safety, physical and technical security upgrades and other directly related work.</p>
<p>Potential construction services will include the provision of professional engineering services, plus construction labor and materials to execute Design/Build (D/B) projects. Construction services will further include on-site supervision to ensure project coordination and control throughout the life of the project. Contractor proposal prices for potential future RFPs (if this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards), shall thereby include all labor, materials, equipment and services necessary to accomplish the design and construction required by the contract documents - to include applicable customs duties, transportation to the site, storage, premiums for insurance and required bonds; and/or the contract documents, permits, license and inspection fees, taxes, and all other items called for by the contract or otherwise necessary for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>IV. Place of Performance:</p>
<p>Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) at U.S. Embassy and Consulate posts worldwide (if this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards).</p>
<p>PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Projects managed under this program require selected offerors to perform both Architect/Engineering (A/E) and construction services that comply with all federal statutes, and in many cases international local laws that will flow-down to the terms and conditions of both the base IDIQ contract and individual Task Orders (TO).</p>
<p>V. Contract Type: <br /><br />The DoS anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts from the issuance of RFPs in early Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. These IDIQs will serve to replace the current DoS FE/BR Program's IDIQs (all due to expire at various points throughout the summer of 2019), and will be referred to as the "FE/BR II Program" herein.</p>
<p>In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards, DoS will utilize the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Process (as governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation's (FAR) Subpart 36.3) to select qualified and credentialed contractors for the FE/BR II Program.</p>
<p>The duration of each potential IDIQ contract will include one (l) base year, plus four (4) option years. Subsequent to IDIQ contract awards, at the conclusion of Phase II of the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection process, all work will be specified in the form of Task Orders (TO). Each potential TO will be:</p>
<p>1. Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) in nature;</p>
<p>2. Competed upon issuance of Task Order Proposal Requests (TOPR) among qualified contractors pursuant to FAR Subpart 16.505(b)(1) - Orders under multiple-award contracts; Fair Opportunity; and</p>
<p>3. Awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.101-2 - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process.</p>
<p>In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in future contract awards, the total range of work on which each potential offeror may be invited to bid on each contract base and option year, is anticipated to be between $25 million and $30 million.</p>
<p>If this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of RFPs, only the top ten (10) most qualified, experienced and credentialed offerors possessing 8(a), HUBZone, and/or Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) socio-economic status with the Small Business Administration (SBA), will be eligible and selected as Phase I pre-qualified vendors.</p>
<p>Additionally, interested business entities should either be integrated D/B organizations with A/E and construction capabilities, or the ability to subcontract with A/E firms and/or specialized niche industry firms (e.g., for ARGB work) in accordance with the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a), HUBZone, and/or Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) status subcontracting rules. Firms that have combined specialties to form Joint Ventures (JV) - as authorized by the SBA - will also be welcomed to participate in the Phase I pre-qualification process.</p>
<p>VI. Acquisition Schedule</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: This Sources Sought/RFI notice will be posted on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) for a minimum of thirty (30) days.

<p>PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Paper copies of this notice will not be mailed to vendors.</p>
<p>If this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of Phase I RFPs for the FE/BR II program, said RFPs will be posted on FedBizOpps in the Fall of 2018 - upon which potential offerors will have approximately thirty (30) days to submit proposals.</p>
<p>Please note that all RFP dates will be subject to change, and any change will be posted via FedBizOpps. It therefore will be the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this Government Point of Entry (GPE) for any information pertaining to this Sources Sought/RFI notice or future solicitations.</p>
<p>VII. Special Requirements:</p>
<p>(1)Potential offerors must possess 8(a) Business Development Program (BD), HUBZone, and/or WOSB entity status with the SBA; or be a qualified and authorized JV with a business entity that falls into any of aforementioned small business socio-economic categories - per the SBA authorization and approval.</p>
<p>(2)The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this procurement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction). Interested parties must demonstrate in their capability statements how they are qualified to perform (or subcontract, or JV in accordance with the SBA rules that govern 8(a), HUBZone, and/or WOSB firms) the work outlined in Attachment 1, "DRAFT" Statement of Work (SOW); and purchase and install, provide post work completion OEM certified inspection reports, and comply with the product specification requirements enumerated in Attachment 2, Diplomatic Security's Approved Barrier List.</p>
<p>(3)Potential offerors shall have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.SAM.gov. Potential offerors must further ensure each firm's submitted Point of Contact's (POC) full name (including first, middle, and last name) is identical in SAM.gov and FBO.gov (in accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864).</p>
<p>(4)Past Performance: In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of Phase I RFPs, potential offerors submitting information for Phase I pre-qualification consideration will address the following criteria in the proposal to provide design and construction services:</p>
<p>a.To demonstrate performance of similar construction work for Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 purposes, potential offerors will need to provide information demonstrating that they have successfully completed, in the United States or at a U.S. diplomatic or consular mission, a construction contract or subcontract involving work of the same general type and complexity as the solicited project and having a contract or subcontract value of at least $250,000.00. The value of the construction contract or subcontract offered to demonstrate performance will not be adjusted for inflation, currency fluctuation, or any other market forces.<br />(5) Security Concerns: In the event this Sources Sought/RFI results in the issuance of Phase I RFPs, potential offerors submitting information for Phase I pre-qualification consideration will address the following criteria in the proposal to provide design and construction services:</p>
<p>b. Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. Firms being considered for award under any future acquisition will be limited to "United States Person" bidders as defined for purposes of Section 401(a)(1) of the Act. Potential offerors will be required to complete and submit as part of its pre-qualification package the pamphlet "Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986." (The pamphlet is attached - Attachment 3 - to this FEDBIZOPPS announcement and may be obtained from the DoS Contracting Officers listed at the end of this notice.) If a JV is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Submissions from potential offerors that do not receive a pass rating in this area will not be further evaluated. Sufficient information should be provided in the Certifications and attachments thereto to determine eligibility under Public Law 99-399, but the Department reserves the right to consider information available from other sources, or to obtain clarifications or additional information from the potential offeror.</p>
<p>c. IMPORTANT NOTE: Firms that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related firms, must do so by way of a JV. A prospective offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal JV (where the arrangement among the co-venturers has been reduced to writing), or "de facto" JV (where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. person firm that guarantees performance). To be considered a "qualified United States JV person," every JV must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. The U.S. person co-venturer will be required to sign a guarantee making the U.S person individually responsible for performance of any contract awarded, notwithstanding the terms of any JV agreement.</p>
<p>d. Security Clearance Requirements. In order to be eligible to perform under any contract resulting from this Sources Sought/RFI notice, the pre-qualified firm(s), including all entities which comprise a JV and the JV itself, must possess or be able to obtain a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, facility clearance and safeguarding level with the required pre-qualification documentation.</p>
<p>e. If an otherwise potential pre-qualified offeror does not possess the necessary FCL, The DoS will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time the offeror is determined to be pre-qualified. The DoS will allow 120 calendar days from the notice of pre-qualification for firms to obtain the necessary FCL. Firms will not receive the classified portions of the Phase II RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received Defense Security Service (DSS) approval to safeguard classified documents. DoS sponsorship does not guarantee that the potential offeror will receive the FCL, or that it will be received within the 120-day period. The government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, pre-qualified firm, if that firm has not been issued a FCL.</p>
<p>i. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: The successful offeror selected for contract award will have to possess or obtain an Information System (IS) approved by DSS for processing classified information up to the Secret level. Performance on future contracts resulting from this Sources Sought/RFI will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C system for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS approved classified IS for processing classified information</p>
<p>ii. PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE: ProjNet is a web service, mandated by the DoS, which allows the secure exchange of design and construction information among authorized business partners. DoS will grant pre-qualified contractors access to the system in Phase II of the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Process.</p>
<p>(6) All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the DoS to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>a. EXEMPTION: Local National (LN) personnel, hired to operate in the countries in which they possess citizenship, that work projects consisting solely of ARGB installations, may be exempt from the requirements enumerated in paragraph 5 and 6 above.</p>
<p>(7) Contractor personnel (to include A/E partners and subcontractors) requiring access to classified information domestically must possess Secret facility and personnel clearances.</p>
<p>(8) At overseas locations, contractors requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances prior to deployment to the site.</p>
<p>NOTE: Specific security clearance requirements will be delineated at the TO level. Some TOs will require the contractor to provide Top Secret cleared personnel eligible for COMSEC/crypto access.</p>
<p>(9) TOs must be bonded at a 100% of the TO amount. Irrevocable Letters of Credit (ILOCs) will be acceptable for individual TOs in lieu of surety bonding. ILOCs will be required for and in the amount of each individual TO.</p>
<p>IIX. Additional Information Requirements</p>
<p>Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements in response to this Sources Sought/RFI.</p>
<p>NOTE: The attached SOW is a "DRAFT" (Attachment 1) and may change if an RFP is issued - however, the core requirements will not change.

<SUBJECT>UMCS IV MATOC Extension

<RESPDATE>091718
<CONTACT>Gloria J. Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 2568951835, Email gloria.j.harris@usace.army.mil
<DESC><p>The United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) Huntsville Center intends to extend the ordering period of the Utility Monitoring and Control System (UMCS) IV Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) through 24 February 2022. The current UMCS IV MATOC has a base period of three years and two 12-month option periods and is currently scheduled to expire on 24 February 2020. There are a total of five (5) small business firms and eight (8) large business firms in the UMCS IV MATOC Restricted and Unrestricted Pools. This action is being executed in accordance with FAR 6.302 - Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition and FAR 52.217-8 - Option to Extend Services.</p>
<p>This action will allow program continuity and critical mission support while allowing the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated with the competitive follow-on procurement. The purpose of the current contracts are to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and non-personal services necessary to perform the procurement and installation of UMCS and similar services such as Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems to include chiller/boiler systems installation and/or integration; Building Automation Systems (BAS); Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems, and other Automated Control Systems including Fire Alarm Safety (FAS) systems, chemical / biological / radiological contaminant detection / filtration / response, utilities (electric/gas/water/steam) metering; Electronic Security Systems (ESS); and security and/or force protection measures such as, but not limited to, barriers, fencing, gates, window treatments, hardening, and lighting worldwide. These services include those actions required to preserve and maintain the systems in such a condition that they may be effectively used for their designated functional purpose.</p>
<p>Awarding to another source while the competitive process for a follow-on contract is occurring would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In addition, award to another source while the competitive process for the follow-on contract is ongoing would also not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling USACE's requirements. This proposed contract modification will provide continued services for UMCS IV MATOC.</p>
<p><strong>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES</strong> and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. This announcement constitutes the only notice by the Government, and is a Special Notice ref. PANHES-18-P-017611. The Government is planning to review the Special Notice responses received as a result of this announcement. Should the Government determine that there is a more efficient means of ensuring continued services other than a modification to extend the current UMCS IV MATOC, the Government reserves the right to pursue the alternate approach. Any interested firm that believes it can meet the requirement in a manner that is more efficient than a contract modification to extend the period of performance on the current UMCS IV MATOC must respond in writing, in the form of a capability statement and address the questions below with a clear and concise response which articulates the ability to comply with the requirements outlined above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>All responses concerning this Special Notice shall be emailed to Gloria Harris email gloria.harris@usace.army.mil not later than 2:00 PM Central Time on 17 September 2018.

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103.  A protest to ECC-A is a “PROTEST TO THE AGENCY,” within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ECC-A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ECC-A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.

(b)  An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the ECC-A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by ECC-A.  Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:

(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)  The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)  An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.

(c)  An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.

(d) For the purpose of filing a ECC-A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts – including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site.  A commander’s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agency’s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision.

(c)   To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times.  Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the “Vendors Login” module and logging in with their user name and password.  The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<BR><BR>

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

A.4.5 GREEN CLEANING

The Contractor shall use green cleaning products and processes.  Green cleaning is a planned and organized approach to cleaning that is designed to protect the occupants and workers' health and reduce the impact on human health and the environment.  Unlike a traditional cleaning program, a green custodial program takes a holistic approach to building cleaning and goes beyond simple appearances to focus on health and the environmental impacts.

Green cleaning products and processes include, but are not limited to products containing recycled content, environmentally preferable products and services, vacuum cleaners with HEPA filtration, bio-based products, and products and services that minimize the use of energy, water, and other resources. In addition to compliance with these requirements, the Contractor shall follow all applicable standard industry practices including, but not limited to those published by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM), and Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI), as well as applicable standards of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The Contractor shall take every precaution to ensure that if available, only safe and environmentally preferable products are used.  Preference must be given to cleaning products that meet the following:  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) designated bio-based products, Green Seal certified (Standard GS-37 for Commercial and Institutional Cleaners, Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPG)), and applicable Executive Orders.

The Contractor shall give preference to supplies and products that are "environmentally preferable".  The list of Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG) items and their associated Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMAN s) are available at http://www.epa.gov/cpg.  Items such as trash bags are on the CPG list.  Information on CPG items can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/cpg/products.htm.  This includes concentrated and ready-to-use cleaning chemicals (spray bottles must be labeled with the contents) that use ecologically sound packaging, are phosphate-free, non-corrosive, non-combustible, non-poisonous, non-reactive, and non-aerosol; contain no carcinogens, mutagens and teratogens; contain no ozone-depleting substances; and are bio-based and fully biodegradable.  Such products must have lower toxicity, and reduced potential for skin, eye, and, respiratory irritation than comparable products used for the same purpose and must contain no unnecessary dyes or fragrances.  Concentrates are preferable compared to ready-to-use products and should be used wherever possible.  Furthermore, dilution control equipment (use equipment or systems consistent with those specified or recommended by the manufacturer of the concentrate products) should be employed to ensure correct dilutions of concentrates and to protect workers from exposure to concentrated chemicals.  Preference must be given to cleaning products meeting the following Green Seal Standards: GS-37 for Commercial and Institutional Cleaners for those product categories covered by this Standard and GS-34 for Degreasers (http://www.greenseal.org/findaproduct/index.cfm#cleaners).

The Contractor must give preference to floor finishes and floor maintenance products that are free of metals, such as zinc, arsenic, lead, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, mercury, nickel, or selenium.

A.4.12 QUALITY ASSURANCE:

The Government COR shall conduct surveillance activities and evaluate the Contractor s performance to ensure services are received in accordance with requirements set forth in this contract.

A notation will be made on the COR checklist of the date and the time the deficiency was discovered and the date and time the Contractor was notified.

If the Government created any of the discrepancies, these will not be counted against the Contractor's performance.  When the Government has caused the Contractor to perform in an unsatisfactory manner, the COR will forward a written notice to the responsible organizational element requesting corrective action be taken and inform the Contract Officer.

When the Contractor is not meeting the acceptable limits of satisfactory performance, a CDR will be issued to the Contractor.  The seriousness of the failures should govern whether to issue CDR, or as soon as work performance is less than satisfactory.

When a CDR is issued for a service, the Contracting Officer and/or the COR may exercise any contractual remedy available for non-performance, in accordance with FAR 52.212-4,  Inspection and Acceptance .  

When a performance threshold has not been met or Contractor performance has not been accomplished, the COR will initiate and provide the CO a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) for issuance to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall respond to the CDR IAW instructions provided and return it to the CO within ten  (10) calendar days of receipt.  The CO will have ten (10) calendar days to respond back to the Contractor with acceptance or rejection of the Contractors  response to the CDR.


If the Contractor does not achieve satisfactory performance by the end of the next period or agreed suspense date, further actions may be considered, to include a determination on whether continued performance by the contractor is feasible.  

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MEETING:

The issuance of a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) found at Attachment 3 may be cause for the scheduling of a meeting among the Contractor, Contracting Officer, and the COR.  A mutual effort will be made to resolve all problems identified.  The Government will prepare written minutes of the meeting.  The Contractor, Contracting Officer, and the COR will sign minutes of the meeting(s).

Should the Contractor not concur with the minutes, they will so state their objections in writing to the Contracting Officer, within ten calendar days, and also explain the reasons for non-concurrence.   The Contracting Officer will review and consider the reasons submitted for the Contractor's non-concurrence and make a decision to revise or uphold the comments as written.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the decision in writing within ten calendar days of submission of any objections.

POSITION/TITLE: ______________________________

DATE: ______________________________

Please check the appropriate blank.

____ New Employee, New Contractor

____ Annual Confirmation for current Employees or Contractor(s) (Due on November 1 of each Contract year)

FOR ALL EMPLOYEES

I have been briefed and understand the following guidance:

INITIALS

_________ The National Cemetery Administration honors veterans with a final resting place and lasting memorial that commemorate their service to our Nation.  National Cemeteries are National Shrines.  Therefore, the standards for management, maintenance, appearance and operational procedures have been established by the National Cemetery Administration to reflect this Nations  concern and respect for those interred there.  For this reason, my strict adherence to the Performance Work Statement, Performance Work Requirements Summary and Guidance Specifications shall be required and shall be essential.  

_________ I will remain aware of the remains buried in the grounds where work is being performed.  The utmost care must be given to these remains and the headstones and flat grave markers that mark those gravesites and memorialize the service of individuals.
 
_________ I will not walk, stand, lean, sit or jump on headstones, markers, or monuments.  Nor will I drive over them.  

_________ I will not place or lean tools, equipment, or other items on headstones, markers, or monuments at any time.  

_________ I have been briefed on the approved methods and tools to remove headstones and markers from their sockets in accordance with the Contract Specifications.  I will use the tools and methods approved by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to lift headstones and markers out of the ground in order to avoid damage; pick axes are not an acceptable tool.

_________ I will not place headstones or markers on dirt piles or mud once they are removed from their sockets; in order to show appropriate respect towards the families visiting the gravesites and the remains that are buried, I will ensure headstones and markers are carefully stored on each associated gravesite and protected from damage or soiling, in accordance with Contract Specifications.

_________ I understand that the Contractor shall be responsible for replacing damaged headstones and markers and for restoring turf damaged during performance of this work.

_________ In the event work on the gravesites results in exposure and/or damage to any remains, container for remains (i.e., casket or urn), or outer burial container, I will IMMEDIATELY notify the COR.  I will take immediate steps to cordon off, protect and cover any exposed remains, container for remains, or outer burial container; and STOP ANY FURTHER WORK on that gravesite until given permission to proceed by the COR.  I will not attempt to reinter exposed remains or reposition outer burial containers.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).
