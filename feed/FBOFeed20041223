The performance work statement (PWS) specifies the services required to provide the full range of operational and maintenance support to the Center twenty-four hours a day seven days a week. 

Facilities operations and maintenance functions shall include the areas of work management, preventive maintenance, building maintenance, shop services, alteration and repair, ground maintenance, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, electrical, housekeeping, information technology and administrative services.  

The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with all applicable USA and Louisiana State laws, regulations, codes, technical manual specifications, manufacturer’s guidelines, and USDA and ARS directives unless otherwise specified or directed. The Contractor shall prepare and submit required reports, compile historical data, perform administrative work, and submit any necessary information as requested or specified. The Contractor may be requested to generate and provide a specific report or a portion of a report with a turn around time of as little as four hours.

The Contractor will provide assistance to other contractors on site whether they are working for them directly or for the Government. This type of assistance normally would be in the locating of various utility lines, valves, piping, switches, relocating equipment or components, moving equipment or components, shutting down or turning on of various equipment, utilities, valves, and switches. Depending on the complexity, on average this would take about one hour total per any one task.  Such functions are in direct support of the research mission of the Center.

<CONTACT>William Galvin Contract Admin 7037871554     William.Galvin@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain one Zeiss Prismo S-ACC 9/12/7 Coordinate Measuring Machine.  This requirement includes, but is not limited to, delivery, installation, set up and training at the technical test center location.  The measuring machine serves to take physical measurements of weapon systems and components to show compliance with weapon system specifications.  The Zeiss Prismo measuring machine comes standard with an active scanning sensor, a machine/work piece temperature sensor, a probe stylus kit, a refrigerated air dryer, specifically designed computer/software system, an integrated rotary table and an automatic probe changing rack among others.  The Zeiss Prismo measuring machine is a 9/12/7, which translates to 67in in width, 80in in length and 119in in height, which meets minimum measurement volume requirements.  As laboratory floor space is limited, a larger machine cannot be accommodated without retrofitting the laboratory.  This is not economically feasible since it would mean moving laboratory equipment, installing new bases to support the equipment and recalibrating it.  To use a different vendor, would result in the inability to validate and verify physical measurements of items under test.  This would also create a down time estimated to be two months, which would significantly impact current and future test schedules for both RTTC and its customers.  Therefore, the required measuring machine must be 100 percent compatible with existing laboratory equipment.  To compete this action and award to another vendor would result in loss of compatibility.  Award to a vendor other than Carl Zeiss Inc. would result in substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to recover through open competition. Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Carl Zeiss Inc. meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST December 30, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Will Galvin, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Will Galvin at  william.galvin@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Kontron Corporation to supply highly customized servers for HID NAS LAN (HNL) system.  These servers comply with the unique requirements for the HNL system and meet FAA critical power requirements as per FAA-2100G specification.  Up to 95 servers will be purchased during FY05 to support replacing aging/failing equipment. All servers in the HNL system must meet the FAA's power specification 2100G.  In rush, current and harmonic distortion are key measurements in ensuring that any server meets this specification.   Servers in the HNL system need to be maintained until 2012.  The FAA will make the initial purchase of at least 95 units.  The FAA must be able to order additional units at any time with the exact same specifications.   It is critical to the FAA, that End of Life (EOL) and End of Service (EOS) issues be handled by the supplier.  The FAA has expended significant resources managing the EOL and EOS issues for its existing hardware.   A Crystalfontz LCD display (model 632) must be incorporated into the server as specified by the FAA.  This display has a USB interface and provides system status visually for each box.  The supplier is responsible for obtaining the LCD displays and integrating them into their server.   In addition to the LCD display on the front panel, a CDROM, CD R/W, and 1.44 floppy drives must be provided to support a boot and run Linux operating system.  The Server must be capable of booting from either CD using a Government Furnished Linux operating system.  To reduce maintenance and logistical costs, this server must be able to fulfill these roles for any server in the HNL system.  The HNL system has HID (Host Interface Device), Network System Monitor (NSM), Store and Forward Application (SAFA), and Host ATM Data Distribution System (HADDS) servers.  These servers provide 4 functions for the system.  The use of one Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) will reduce overall life cycle costs for the servers performing any of the 4 functions.  The FAA will supply (GFE) PCCA cards for some of the servers.  The PCCA card, from Sunhillo, is PCI based card that is used to interface with IBM's mainframe propriety bus and tag interface.  The FAA has both 5 volt and 3.3 volt versions of the card.  The server must handle both of these cards.    HNL servers are part of the Air Traffic Control System.  They are required to perform at the essential level of service.  HNL system is design to perform at the critical level of service and is on the critical power system.  Stringent quality control is essential to meet reliability objectives.  The FAA reviews quality certifications as part of its program to ensure reliability objectives.  Industry certifications, such as UL (Underwriter Laboratories), are one way the FAA can measure potential reliability of new hardware.   In order to provide the ability to upgrade the unit without replacing the entire server, the FAA has determined that a single board computer (SBC) is the solution that is the most cost effective.  The SBC can be replaced by the FAA to increase performance, capability, or life expectancy.  In addition to the above specifications, the following specifications are required for all servers: 1 gigabyte of RAM 2U form factor case Intel processor with at least 2.8 Mhz or better Front side bus speed of 833 Mhz or better Server based chip set e.g. Grand Champion Chipset Single Board Computer with dual voltage back plane 2 Ethernet 10baseT/100baseT ports 40 gigabyte hard drive CDROM drive CD R/W drive 1.44 floppy drive 2 year manufacturer's warranty The FAA has identified Kontron Corporation, of San Diego, CA, as the only vendor that can provide the requisite specifications and services identified above.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing these services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Lori Rudnik, Contracts Specialist, by 4 PM (eastern time) on December 29, 2004, at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Contracts Branch, ACX-52, Atlantic City International Airport, N.J. 08405.   Attachments: none.

    Introduction to Programming Concepts Using SAS Software:  
This two-day beginner’s course teaches you how to plan and write simple SAS programs to solve common data analysis problems.  Workshops are included to provide practice in running and debugging those programs in an interactive SAS session.  The course highlights reading input data, creating simple list reports, creating simple summary reports, defining new data columns, and executing code conditionally.  

    SAS Programming I: Essentials:  
This is a three-day foundation course that teaches you how to write SAS programs to accomplish typical data-processing tasks. It focuses on the following key areas: reading raw data files and SAS data sets and writing the results to SAS data sets; subsetting data; combining multiple SAS files; creating SAS variables and recoding data values; and creating listing, HTML, and summary reports. This course builds on the concepts and skills presented in the Introduction to Programming Concepts Using SAS Software course. However, students who have some programming experience may choose this course as a starting point.

This three-day course focuses on how to manage SAS data set input and output, work with different data types, and manipulate data.  This course builds on the concepts presented in the SAS Programming I: Essentials course and is not recommended for beginning SAS software users.  This course focuses on using the DATA step to control SAS data set input and output, combine SAS data sets, summarize data, process data iteratively with DO loops and arrays, and perform data manipulations and transformations.  

    SQL Processing with the SAS System:  
This two-day course focuses on using SQL as a data query and manipulation tool.  You learn to use the SQL procedure as a data retrieval tool within SAS programs.  Specifically, you learn how to perform queries on data; retrieve data from multiple tables; create views, indexes, and tables; and update or delete values in existing tables and views.  Using features of the SQL procedure to debug, test, and optimize the performance of SQL queries is also discussed.  

  SAS MACRO Language:  
This two-day course focuses on the components of the SAS macro facility and how to design, write, and debug macro systems.  Emphasis is placed on understanding how programs with and without macro code are processed.  

    Processing Database and Spreadsheet Data with SAS/ACCESS Software:  
This one-day course teaches you how to read and update data in databases and spreadsheets using Version 8 SAS/ACCESS software and how to create new database tables and spreadsheets. You also learn efficiency techniques for optimizing data access performance.  

   SAS Report Writing: A Programming Approach:  
This two-day course concentrates on the REPORT procedure and also provides information on producing reports using the FORMAT, TABULATE, and MEANS procedures.  Information on producing reports with the macro facility and the DATA step is also included in this course.  You learn to create detail and summary reports, tabular reports, and use the Output Delivery System (ODS) to create HTML output.  

The BLS has three training rooms in the Postal Square Building (PSB), each of which is equipped with Dell Pentium desktop computers for up to eighteen students.  Classes will have a minimum of 8 students and the training will be conducted on-site in the PSB.  The vendor will provide all services associated with delivering quality training for system developers, analysts, computer specialists, end-users, managers, and project leaders who require a comprehensive understanding of the subject material.

Students will learn how to administer, structure, and architect systems that are capable of handling large throughput and concurrency.  

  <>  Fundamentals of J2EE Web Application Development Using WebLogic Server.  
This 4.5 day course will focus on the flexibility afforded by using WebLogic Server and its implementation of the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) specification during Web-based application development. Students will learn the core features of the presentation components (Servlets and JavaServer Pages) and service technologies (naming services, distributed transactions, and multi-tier database access). The course also covers the deployment of Web applications, using XML-based configuration files and the WebLogic Server Administration Console. Additionally, students are introduced to the concepts of design patterns and how they are used in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture.  The course provides a brief introduction into the motivation and client-side use of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).  Instructor-led lab exercises will reinforce the syntax and architecture concepts presented in lecture through the incremental development of a simple online product purchase application.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) not to exceed $50,000 for Information Technology (IT) on site training as described below.  Proposals are being requested by January 10.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

  <>  Beginning Java Objects:  
This course represents an important first step for anyone who wishes to become proficient with an object-oriented programming language in general and the Java language in particular.  The goals of this course are to:  
  - Make students comfortable with fundamental object-oriented (OO) terminology and concepts.
  - To serve as the proper grounding for learning an object-oriented programming language (OOPL) such as Java.
  - Provide an introduction to core Java language syntax.
  - Enable students to read and understand simple Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.
  - Illustrate the basics of how such a UML class diagram is translated into a working software application – a Java application, to be specific.

  <>  Deploying Java Objects:  
This course, intended as a sequel to the Beginning Java Objects course, builds upon the concepts taught in the Beginning Java Objects to illustrate how a command line driven application (such as the banking application built by students through lab exercise in the first course) can be rounded out into an “industrial strength” application employing a graphical user interface (GUI) front end and a means of persisting data.  Upon completion of this course the participant will be able to accomplish the following:  
  - With respect to data persistence, students will learn how to store and retrieve data from text files, and are introduced conceptually to the use of the JDBC API for accessing relational databases.
  - With respect to GUI technology, the course teaches students how to develop:  a stand-alone Java application using the Swing API and a Web deployed application consisting of a Java servlet back-end generating an HTML front end.
  - Students are also introduced conceptually to the use of applets, Java Server Pages (JSPs), and Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) in deploying web based, Java enabled application.

<DESC>Seven T-AO 187 Class vessels are fitted with Cogenel/Alstom PTO (Power Take Off – Generation Mode)/PTI (Power Take In – Motorization Mode) systems.  These control systems are based on 1970’s analog op-amp processing technology.  These systems are outdated and hence experience supportability problems.  The cost and lead-time to obtain replacement parts results in unjustifiably long down times that are unacceptable for the ship’s role as a U.S. Naval Oiler and Replenishment Supply Ship.  Consequently, these Cogenel PTO/PTI Control Systems will be upgraded to increase reliability and extend the life of the entire PTO/PTI System.  The objective of this procurement is to contract for a replacement control system for the PTO/PTI installation. The replacement system shall be, at a minimum, a one for one replacement for the current system in terms of functionality.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), plans to procure on a sole source basis a review committee for the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Death Review Committee (DRC).  The proposed contract will be awarded to three individuals John H. Edmonson, M.D., 718 18th Avenue, Southwest Rochester, MN; Peter C. Albertsen, M.D, 16 Pinnacle Mountain Road, Simsbury CT; and Eli J. Glatstein M.D, 220 W., Rittenhouse Square No. 12D, Philadelphia, PA.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.   The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial is a large scale, randomized study to determine whether certain screening tests will reduce the number of deaths from these cancers.  Contractor requirements:  1) The contractor shall review cases that have evidence of a prostate, lung, colon, rectal or ovarian (PLCO) cancer, evidence of a condition associated with a PLCO organ, or a death of unclear etiology, 2) The contractor shall evaluate the adequacy of the information, 3) The contractor shall decide whether they consider the participant=s death to be: Adefinitely due to@, Aprobably due to@, Aprobably not due to@, or Adefinitely not due to@, prostate, lung, colorectal or ovarian cancer, 4) The contractor shall decide whether or not other competing disease processes contributed to death, 5) The contractor shall complete the Cause of Death Questionnaire and, 6) The contractor shall participate in a conference call to discuss cases where there was disagreement for either the cause of death or the site of the cancer.  It is essential that the Early Detection Research Group and the PLCO Trial utilize Dr. Edmonson, Dr. Albertsen and Dr. Glatstein's expertise.  These doctors are currently members of the PLCO Death Review Committee. This review process plays an important role in minimizing bias in assignment of PLCO cancer as cause of death on the death certificate, and therefore ensures a more accurate assessment of the value of these PLCO screening exams. Period of performance:  Drs Edmonson, Albertsen and Glatstein are the only known contractors that can provide the required service. They have been intimately involved with the PLCO death review process since its inception and, therefore, have a comprehensive understanding of this complex review process.  The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial is a high profile NCI trial accounting for about half of all cancer deaths in the US in its focus.  As the primary endpoint of this multi-year screening study is mortality from the four PLCO cancers, it is critical that the doctors' expertise in the PLCO death review process be utilized. Base year January 24, 2005 - January 24, 2006 with four (4) option years. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  As original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST on January 13, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft at the above email address to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a bureau of the Department of The Treasury, operates a supplemental long-term disability plan for its employees.  The plan covers approximately 900 employees, with some 245 of these participants located in the metropolitan Washington, DC area.  The remaining employees are located in OTS' four regional offices around the country.  The OTS intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) for an -insurance carrier- to manage and operate the long-term disability plan, which will cover the following groups:  1- current and future active full-time and part-time employees; and 2- temporary employees  (non-permanent appointments).  The plan serves as a supplement to disability benefits currently available to OTS employees under the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), and the Financial Institutions Retirement Fund (FIRF) retirement system.  Offerors shall propose a plan that replicates the current OTS long-term disability plan design.  The resultant contract will have a base plan year of 12 months covering calendar year 2005, a provision for optional plan years in 2006 and 2007, plus and an additional option for up to six (6) months.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The anticipated issuance date for the RFP is July 27, 2004, with proposals due by August 27, 2004.  The RFP will be posted to the Government’s Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPS) web-site under the location for the Office of Thrift Supervision’s announcements, which is at the Department of The Treasury’s home page.  It will also be posted to the OTS’s web-site.  All responsible 
insurance carriers having an interest in providing these important services to OTS’s employees may submit a proposal, which will be evaluated by the OTS.  The RFP will provide guidance regarding submission of proposals.  Please direct any questions regarding this synopsis to douglas.mason@OTS.treas.gov.  Please be advised that all correspondence pertaining to this requirement will also be posted to the FEDBIZOPPS and OTS web sites.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR SMALL BUSINESS INTEREST IN THE C-26 CLS PROGRAM

RFP N00019-05-R-1586  C-26 CLS effort

NAVAIR is requesting that any company that is a small business under NAICS code 488190 and is interested in being the prime contractor for this effort submit information that will allow the Contracting Officer to determine that the Government can expect to receive viable offers from at least two responsible, competing SBs capable of performing the work set out in the draft Statement of Work.  The top level SOW for (N00019-05-R-0024) will reside on the NAVAIR Home Page (http://www.navair.navy.mil). 

Companies are reminded that the effort calls for line level (Navy “O” level) maintenance and repair of aircraft at three sites:  Barking Sands HW (three a/c), Sigonella Italy (two a/c) and Naples Italy (two a/c).  These locations are subject to change.  The contractor is expected to provide adequate staffing to keep the a/c flying at a minimum availability rate of 80%.  The company must cover all costs associated with hiring personnel, transporting them to the site, passports/visas, health/medical records or requirements, etc. 
Each company should provide information, including financial capability, sufficient to convince the Contracting Officer that it can provide the services and personnel in a manner that will not jeopardize current, ongoing operations.

This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information being requested is more than normally provided by a regular, company capabilities statement, previously requested 07 December.  The purpose of this information is to assist the Government in determining whether or not this effort should be a small business set-aside.

This notice (N00019-05-R-0024) and SOW will also reside on the NAVAIR Home Page (http://www.navair.navy.mil) located on the World Wide Web (WWW) and accessed by client browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer.

The maximum contract value may not exceed $10M aggregate total.  The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $10K.  The value of individual task orders executed under this contract may range from $1K to $1M.

Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.  Contract term is for a one-year base period with two option periods.  Each performance period will run 365 calendar days, or until the maximum dollar limit is reached, whichever occurs first.  The government may exercise the option periods unilaterally.  Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise.  Estimated start date for this contract is May 2005.

The US Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management (A/LM/AQM), on behalf of the Overseas Building Operations, Security Management (OBO/PE/SM) is seeking firms to provide site security personnel Cleared American Guards (CAGS) and Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTS) for various domestic locations and overseas construction sites and storage areas.  At a minimum, the construction security services personnel will be required to, a) detect unauthorized access into controlled areas; b) surveil the activities of uncleared workers to prevent the implantation of clandestine surveillance devices or systems into the structure being constructed, or its surroundings.
Offerors will be required to provide double rates for domestic and overseas personnel to be eligible for award.  Personnel providing CAG and CST services both domestically and overseas, must successfully complete the Department's specialized security training prior to contract assignment.  The government anticipates awarding at least three Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with at least one award set-aside for small business.  Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year option service periods.  The minimum for each contract is anticipated to be 250K in task orders over the life of a 5-year period.  All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award.  Offerors can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423.  Special Note:  In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offerors must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DOD) Top Secret facility clearance, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  All personnel providing CAG and CST services must also possess a Top Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).  Offerors already possessing the necessary facility clearance should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their proposal.  If a selected offeror does not possess the necessary facility clearance, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for a facility clearance.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  A period of up to 90 calendar days from the date of final selection of the final offeror(s) will be allowed for the selected firm(s) to obtain the necessary facility clearance.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm.  Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above facility clearance and personnel security clearance requirements.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  The estimated issue date for the Request for Proposals is on or about November 17, 2004 and a modification shall be issued to this announcement requesting a proposal from all interested parties.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Resources Team is part of the Program Support Division of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance.  The Resources Team core functions are procurement, procurement planning, budgeting, policy guidance, and management of contracts for program-funded personnel.  The Program Operations Specialist (POS) works closely with the Resources Team Leader to carry out these functions.  The Program Operations Specialist requires experience working in government, an international organization, or a business setting with responsibilities related to procurement, human resources, and budget/finance.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OBJECTIVE

The Resources Team requires a Program Operations Specialist to strengthen its capacity to provide prompt, effective services in the areas of personal services contract (PSC) staffing and management, and simplified acquisitions, to support OFDA’s mission of saving lives, reducing human suffering, and mitigating the economic impact of disasters.

The following guidance has established the necessary requirements to accomplish Utility Privatization (UP):  10 U.S.C. 2688 (1997) and OSD UP Guidance (09 Oct 02).  More specific information on the utility system being privatized will be provided in any resulting Request for Proposal.  DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT MARCH 31, 2005.  The RFP will be synopsized on or about February 15, 2005.  

Installation Description:

The United States Army Medical Center WRAMC is located in Washington, DC on Georgia Avenue.  WRAMC consists of the Main Section and the Forest Glen Annex. The utilities at the main section and Forest Glen (with the exception of the Historical Area) are included in this solicitation. The Main Section of WRAMC is located in a Washington residential area between Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue near the Maryland-D.C. boundary. All patient care activities, as well as most WRAMC administrative services, are located on main post.

Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Forest Glen section is located in Silver Spring, Md., approximately four miles north of the main post. Forest Glen has a land area of 164 acres. It includes a contemporary area, adjacent to a mixed commercial district, and a historic district located in the wooded area that borders the Capital Beltway (I-495). The historic district is located on a 27-acre parcel of land called the National Park Seminary Historic District. The department of the Army has declared this property excess, pending transfer to the General Services Administration to find a new owner. The Historical District is no longer managed by the Army public utilities department. The contemporary area is home to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and Naval Medical Research Institute. 

Description of Facilities:  
	
A.  Electrical Distribution System:  The Walter Reed Army Medical Center electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation to be defined by the Solicitation or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The system may include, but is not limited to transformers, underground and overhead circuits, utility poles, switches, streetlights, and vaults.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description. 

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the electrical system.

	The installation shall retain joint use of all electrical utility poles.

The Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) electric power distribution systems, at both the Main Campus and the Forest Glen Annex use 13.2 kV underground cables from a government owned switching station.  Each local switching station is served from Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) owned 13.2 kV feeders.  Each site also has several loads already fed directly from PEPCO feeders.  A short section of 4.16 kV overhead distribution line serves a portion of the load at Forest Glen.  The cables and distributions transformers at both sites are in good condition.  The switching station at Forest Glen has recently been renovated, and the switching station at the Main Campus is in the process of being replaced.

All of the distribution transformers at Forest Glen are pad mounted outside the buildings.  At the Main Campus, most of the distribution transformers are installed in vaults or pad mounted, but some of the larger buildings, such as the main hospital building, have 13.2 kV feeders routed inside the building to serve step-down transformers.

The Main Campus of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) receives power at Building 95; the main switching station from four Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) owned 13.2 kV feeders.  All load at the WRAMC Main Campus except buildings 18 and 54 are fed from this switching station.  Three incoming feeders are designated as normal and one is designated as emergency.  Each incoming feeder is rated for 1200 Amperes or 27 Million Volt-Amperes (MVA); however the feeders appear to be relayed for 400 Amperes or 9 MVA.  The incoming feeders are connected to three buses configured in a “Ring-Bus”.  Each bus section is rated for 1200 Amperes.  Each of the three bus sections in the ring radially serves one bus with five outgoing feeders (fifteen outgoing feeders total).  There is no voltage transformation in the substation.  Each outgoing feeder is relayed for 150 Amperes (approximately 3.4 MVA), except feeders 1E, 2E, and 3E, which have 400 ampere relay settings (approximately 9 MVA, each).  These three feeders provide dedicated service to the main hospital, Building 2.  PEPCO metering is installed inside the substation.

There are approximately 5.2 miles of underground 13.2 kV distribution cable installed in duct banks on the WRAMC Main Campus.  With some exceptions, the feeders are all radial, but the duct system is configured in a double loop that allows major facilities to be served from two or three feeders via different routes from the switching station.  Manholes are installed in the duct banks at 100 to 300 foot intervals, depending on straightness of the runs and need for cable taps.  

There are approximately 59 distribution transformers on the WRAMC Main Campus which step-down the 13.2 kV distribution power to utilization voltage of 4160/2400 Volts, 480/277 Volts or 208/120 Volts.  Most of the transformers are installed in underground vaults outside the buildings.  However, some of the larger buildings have transformers installed in their electrical rooms feeding directly into low voltage switchboards and panelboards.

The project to replace the Main Campus switching station involves the construction of three (3) multi-section electrical switching station units to be housed in a partially underground storage area.  Each switching station unit will consist of one (1) normal incoming feeder, one (1) alternate incoming feeder with a tie vacuum breaker, five (5) outgoing feeders, and a spare breaker. Once the new switching stations are operational the existing switching facility will be decommissioned and demolished. All existing downstream transformers will be provided with fused dual primary selective switches, which will limit the available fault current at each transformer.

The WRAMC Forest Glen Annex (Forest Glen) receives power at Building 192, the main switching station, from one PEPCO owned 13.2 kV feeder.  A second PEPCO feeder was installed to the recently completed switching station to support the load addition from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Facility.  There are three outgoing feeders from the switching station, each of which is rated for approximately 5.5 MVA.  Most buildings at Forest Glen, with the following exceptions, are fed from this switching station.  The buildings near the ball fields are fed from a 4160 Volt overhead distribution line from a step down station in the historic area.  The “500" series buildings accessed from Brookville Road are fed from an underground feeder served from a PEPCO metering pole at Brookville Road.  Buildings 516 and 513 are served from a PEPCO owned pole-mounted transformer behind building 516.  Building 513 is served from building 516.  Building 173 is served directly from PEPCO, with a PEPCO meter on the outside back wall of the building.

There are approximately 1.3 miles of Government owned 13.2 kV distribution cables at Forest Glen, installed in duct banks.  There is some uncertainty about the exact length of 13.2 kV cables at Forest Glen serving the WRAIR Facility.  Manholes are installed in the duct banks at 200 to 300 foot intervals, depending on straightness of the runs and need for cable taps. There is also an 800 foot long government owned 4.16 kV distribution line, mentioned above, on the Forest Glen Annex.  This line is connected to the 4.16 kV substation, building 180, through a government owned feeder in the historic area, which is not part of this contract.

Approximately 17 government owned transformers at Forest Glen step-down the 13.2 kV or 4.16 kV distribution power to utilization voltage of 480/277 Volts or 208/120 Volts.  Additional transformers have been installed to serve the WRAIR Facility. 
  
B.  Steam Distribution System:  The WRAMC steam distribution system comprises all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the Boiler house to the points of demarcation to be defined by the Solicitation or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The systems may include, but are not limited to distribution piping and appurtenances.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution systems.  The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the bidder’s library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description.  

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the steam and boiler systems.

The main campus steam distribution system consists of three major components, the boilers and boiler house, the main steam campus distribution system located with the utility tunnels and the direct bury steam distribution piping from the campus distribution system in the tunnels to within 5 feet of the end user’s building.   The following is a detailed description of each system based on existing drawings, interviews and recently completed reports.  

The steam generation plant at WRAMC is a centralized steam generating facility which provides steam throughout the campus for heating and other base specific needs.  The Steam system is comprised of four dual fuel (natural gas primary, with #2 fuel oil backup) boilers which supply the facility with 110 pounds per square inch (psi) steam.  

The facility has been upgraded throughout the years and some of the most significant improvements include, replacement of the condensate return tank in 1982, installation of new fuel oil tanks in 1994, replacing the portions of the controls, wiring and valves in 2002.   The boiler support equipment consists of typical steam plant components such as, condensate receiver, deaerating feed tank, condensate pump (Electric – 2, Steam -1)  boiler feed water pumps (Steam – 2, Electric -2), fuel oil transfer pumps, economizers for boilers 1 and 2, and make up water chemical treatment to identify some of the major equipment.  The boilers and boiler house are maintained and operated by The Department of Public Works (DPW).

The steam distribution system at WRAMC consists of the main steam supply lines located in tunnels.  The tunnels are identified as the West and North Tunnels and are approximately 4,700 linear feet containing steam, condensate, high pressure drip and other utility services.  The existing north tunnel was built around the beginning of the 20th century and the newer west tunnel constructed in the mid 80’s.  The piping within the tunnels ranging in diameter from ¾ inch for high pressure drip traps to 18 inches for high pressure steam distribution mains. 

The buildings are supplied from the mains located within the tunnels via direct bury piping to the buildings.  The underground piping consists of approximately 4,500 linear feet of direct buried piping of various sizes supplying steam and returning condensate.  In some cases the piping is routed through buildings rather then using a utility tunnel or direct bury piping for ease of access.  The evaluation of the steam system ends approximately 5 feet from the building.  The steam distribution system is maintained and operated by The Department of Public Works (DPW).

C.

The upgrade will be replacing an MTS model 442 controller. At a minimum, the new system must meet the following requirements:  It must be able to interface with other MTS control systems and have AC/DC conditioners that are interchangeable between existing MTS Teststar IIs control systems. The control system must have one analog input for high level data signal or external programming, three analog outputs, four digital inputs and four digital outputs, with one pair dedicated to the interlock system. The controller processor must be capable of update rates of 6 kHz or higher. The controller must be supplied with a dedicated 2.66 MHz PC that has a minimum 512 MB SDRAM memory, 512 KB cache memory, 40 GB hard drive 1.44 MB diskette drive, CD/RW (X48) and Windows XP or 2000 operating system. Capabilities of the controller must include a function generator that is capable of generating monotonic ramps and cyclic waveforms using sine, square and triangular shapes; graphic color display with meters that provide digital displays of specified measurements such as load, time, displacement, etc.; automatic zeroing with bumpless start and bumpless transfer between control modes; ability to save and restore PID tuning settings; and adaptive control compensation with peak-valley and null pacing. The control system must be provided with universal conditioners that provide conditioning for AC or DC transducers. These conditioners must be interchangeable between machines and normalized with an on board reference for portability of calibrations. The computer supplied with the system must provide control of range, transducer zero, excitation and filtering. The conditioner must provide 100% range shunt calibration. The conditioner must also provide strain gage bridge completion. The system must provide six auxiliary input channels with BNC adapter leads for high level (+/- 10 volt) analog signals which can be used for control and data acquisition.

CLASSCOD: A--Research and Development
OFFADD: Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Attn: DSCP-PBA, Bldg. 36-2, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5092
SUBJECT: A— PROCUREMENT READINESS OPTIMIZATION - ADVANCED CASTING TECHNOLOGIES (PRO-ACT)
SOL: BAA 05-0001
DUE:  February 8, 2005
POC: Assunta (Sue) Bonanno/215-737-7339 
Email: assunta.bonanno@dla.mil . 


The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is soliciting proposals for the PRO-ACT program which seeks to demonstrate readiness improvements by developing and applying innovative methods of designing, manufacturing and buying weapons systems spares through advanced casting technologies. Proposed research should result in significant improvements to the existing state of practice. Technical oversight of the projects selected for funding under this BAA will be performed by DLA and/or the Military Services. Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $10 million is planned during Fiscal Years 05 - 09 for funding efforts selected from this BAA.  Proposals for less than the total amount and shorter than the total duration are welcomed.

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Offerors must submit an original and two (2) copies of full proposals and refer to BAA# 05-001 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on Tuesday, February 8, 2005, to DSCP-Business Opportunities Office, Bldg 36, 2nd floor, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111 in order to be considered. In addition to the paper versions, proposals shall be sent by email to the POC at the top of this BAA in a file format compatible with Microsoft Office programs. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. The Government reserves the right to select for award none, one or more contractor teams from the proposals received. The maximum expected period of performance for any awarded contract is 5 years.  This is an unrestricted acquisition. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DLA. DSCP encourages industry, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI) to submit proposals under this BAA. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology. For purposes of this acquisition, the small business size standard is 500 employees. Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal for this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail or fax is preferred. 


AREAS OF INTEREST: Proposers are encouraged to develop project teams involving all of the elements of the metal casting supply chain in order to achieve the overall goal of this program. Proposed work should result in the delivery of tools such as industry standards, best practices, guidelines, and software which have continuing value to the Department of Defense and the industrial base. 

Areas of interest are: 

•	tools for casting technical data package review and modernization;
•	tools for evaluating foundry products and processes for best value source selection;
•	foundry processes which improve the speed and predictability of casting manufacture;
•	tools for capturing, retaining, and recalling casting process models, so that older items, which have not been made for a number of years, can be put back in production quickly with minimum risk;
•	 best practices for qualification of new casting materials and processes when old materials and processes are no longer viable;
•	interactive web based software tools for design engineers to walk through potential casting applications and come up with decisions (process and material selection) whether application is appropriate for casting;
•	improved acceptance standards such as reference radiographs;
•	casting applications development for small lots and short lead times, which will demonstrate the technical and economic superiority of castings to meet these goals, through promotional activities that can be targeted at single industries or can be broad spectrum promotions in seminars and trade shows.  
•	demonstrations of cost reduction potential arising from casting applications.

Although DLA sees special merit in these areas, offerors are free to innovate and are not limited to proposing exactly these technology areas. Equal consideration will be given to all approaches that enable improved readiness for weapon system spares made from castings.

SUBMISSION PROCESS: The proposal should express a consolidated effort in support of one or more related technical concepts or ideas. Disjointed efforts should not be included into a single proposal.

 
PROPOSAL FORMAT: All proposals must be in the format given below. Non-conforming proposals may be rejected without review.

 VOLUME II, Cost Proposal {no page limit}: adequate price competition is anticipated; therefore, offerors are not required to submit certified cost or pricing data. Offerors must submit cost or pricing information only to the extent necessary to provide the government the ability to determine the reasonableness and realism of the cost and/or price. The offeror's format for submitting such information is acceptable; however, offerors are encouraged to use a Standard Form (SF) 1448, Proposal Cover Sheet (cost or pricing data not required). Copies of an SF 1448 may be obtained from the POC listed above. Cost proposals should be organized to include two sections in the following order: total project cost, and cost sharing and in-kind contributions.

 Section 1 - Total Project Cost - will include total project cost by month. The offeror will also give a detailed breakdown of the total project costs, broken down by each task appearing in the proposed SOW. The total cost of each major cost element and the make-up of those costs should be presented in the offeror's proposal. Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, material purchases, fair market rental value of leased items and the method used for making such evaluations. 

Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-kind contributions will include (1) the sources of cash and amounts; (2) the specific in-kind contributions, their value in monetary terms, and the methodology used to derive their values. Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the sources of cost share so that a determination regarding availability, timeliness, and control of the resources may be made by the government.

EVALUATION CRITERIA/EVALUATION AND FUNDING PROCESSES: The selection for contract award will be based on detailed technical review by designated Government representatives of all proposals submitted in response to this BAA.  Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. DLA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons. For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the two-volume document (technical and cost) described in PROPOSAL FORMAT (see below). Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposals will be considered for the reviewer's convenience only and not considered as part of the proposal.
Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a detailed review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:

 (1) Overall scientific and technical merit: the overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept must be clearly defined and developed. Emphasis must be placed on the technical value and soundness of the development and experimentation approach, as well as on the metrics to be employed to assess progress and achievement of the objective. The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable. Roles of team members must be clearly described.
(2) Offeror's past performance, capabilities, and related experience: the technical proposal must provide evidence of previous technical expertise, experience and implementation of the proposed approach; 
(3) Potential contribution and relevance to DLA's mission: The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will be the goals of PRO-ACT. The offeror must clearly state the problem to be solved, address how solving that problem will satisfy an existing DLA need, describe what the benefits to DLA will be from the new problem solution and/or capability, and discuss how successful results will be implemented or transferred. Relevance to DLA is further indicated by the offeror’s understanding of the operating environment in which the new solution/capability will be implemented.
 (4) Cost realism, including the extent (total or proportion) of cost share. The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of costs (rates for the proposed categories) for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation will consider the value to the Government of the research and the extent to which the proposed technical plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.

GENERAL INFORMATION

To be eligible for award, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems, ability to comply with performance schedules, prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment. For additional information and guidance concerning qualifications and standards for responsibility of prospective contractors, please refer to Part 9 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

 As soon as the proposal evaluation is completed, the proposer will be notified of selectability or non-selectability. Selectable proposals will be considered for funding; non-selectable proposals will be destroyed. (One copy of non-selectable proposals may be retained for file purposes). Not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded. Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability and merits of the proposal. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Due to the commercial market profit potential, some level of cost sharing is required, and proposals identified for funding will result in a cost share contract. Profit/fee is not applicable under cost share contracts.  Proposals based on a type of contract other than that contemplated will NOT be considered.

The Government is anticipating a firm fixed price award for this solicitation. Statement of Work for – Organizing, Conducting, and Further Developing the Interagency Trade Officer Training Program Background The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is an interagency task force, chaired by the Department of Commerce.  It was created in 1992 to coordinate the export promotion and export finance activities of the U.S. Government.  One of the chief duties of the TPCC is to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses.  The TPCC’s 2002 National Export Strategy Report to Congress called on the trade promotion agencies to develop a training program to improve customer service by strengthening interagency cooperation and client management.  Research indicated that customer service would improve if trade promotion staff in each agency had a more sophisticated understanding of the programs of other agencies and how they interrelate.  In 2003, the TPCC responded with the pilot Interagency Trade Officer Training Program.  Three sessions were conducted with the full-time support of a senior officer of the Commercial Service (on temporary assignment to the TPCC) and the services of a contractor.  In 2004, the TPCC retained a full-service contractor to further develop the program and organize and conduct three training sessions.   With very positive feedback and continued demand from participating agencies, the TPCC plans to continue this training initiative.  Work Description  The TPCC is seeking proposals for the organization, conduct and ongoing development of the training program.  The period of performance is 12 months with two additional 12 month option periods.  Within 12 months there shall be three training sessions conducted by the contractor.  The duration of each session is approximately four days.   In 2005, the three sessions shall be conducted sometime in March/April (first session), May/June (second session), and September (third session).  Specific dates have yet to be set.  The purpose of this work is to prepare the next generation of international trade officers to accurately and holistically gauge their customers’ real needs in relation to the full array of federal export promotion programs and services available.  Course content must give participants a clear understanding of:  Impact of the competitive business environment on the customer service needs of U.S. companies (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) 1. Best practices government can apply to create higher customer value across agencies; 2.  Trade promotion counseling and marketing programs across the federal government;   3.  Federal information and IT resources available to U.S. businesses;  4. Trade finance issues and federal trade finance services and solutions;  5. Advocacy, market access and trade compliance services of the federal government;  6.  Other government programs that impact U.S. exporters and their competitiveness (e.g., export controls).  Deliverables   In order to achieve the desired level of interagency staff expertise and understanding, this work requires the following deliverables:  1.  Developing a four-day curriculum based on the course content above no later than three weeks after award.  2.  Recruiting and scheduling qualified presenters from throughout government and the private sector.  3.  Coaching presenters from each agency to address TPCC themes, e.g., clean hand-offs/referrals of clients between agencies, strategic coordination between agencies.  4.  Preparation of briefing books and course material CDs for each participant (30-40 per session, 90-120 per year).  5.  Development of multiple interactive exercises, including at least two real-world case studies that bring in U.S. company representatives to work with break out groups (2-4 business reps per session).  6.  Comprehensive evaluation/review of the program with the participants, including full feedback reports to the TPCC no later than one week after conclusion of each session.  7.  Ongoing development of the curriculum and agenda to reflect changes in the business environment and in government programs.  Evaluation Criteria The Government will evaluate the technical and past performance;  (1) technical requirements, (2) corporate and personnel experience, and (3) three past performance references.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  ion trapping group, Boulder CO requires an electron multiplication charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera which uses an e2v CCD97 back illuminated chip (512x512 pixels) as the sensor element. In order to obtain the low light level capability (essentially photon counting on zero background) required for the ion storage group's work, the camera must cool the CCD chip to below -70 degrees C. Because the camera will be used at the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of 313 nm and 280 nm, the back illuminated CCD chip must be coated with a UV sensitive phosphor which provides a quantum efficiency of greater than 30 percent at these wavelengths. In addition, the window in front of the CCD chip which provides a hermetic vacuum seal should consist of a single UV grade fused silica window with a UV anti-reflection coating which gives an overall transmission at 313 nm and 280 nm of greater than 96 percent. This coating must maintain a transmission at all other wavelengths (190 nm -900 nm) of greater than 80 percent. In order to minimize spurious background noise during readout, vertical clock speeds faster than 2 microseconds and a CCD chip readout rate of 10 Megapixels/s or faster is required. Comprehensive software control of the camera is required, including the ability to directly spool data to hard drive.  The camera must have a built-in mechanical shutter for easy recording of dark background images. The delivery time should be less than 90 days ARO.***Technical merit, as well as price, will be considered in selecting a vendor. Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by email. You may submit your proposal by email, fax, or by mail.   Proposal must be received on or before close of business January 10, 2005.  Please include delivery date, F.O.B. point, business size, and Dun and Bradstreet Number. Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov ***This is a small business set aside.  The NAICS code is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. ***The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items - The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered;  FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The following is incorporated into this solicitation:

The definitional mission team will explore all types of energy sector projects in Kenya and Uganda, looking for projects that may be the best match for USTDA funding.  USTDA has received some leads (but no proposals), including for geothermal energy projects in both Kenya and Uganda, and for power transmission and rural electrification projects in both countries.  The teams should not limit themselves to these projects (and these type of energy-sector activities).  Teams should have broad energy-sector experience.  USTDA seeks to increase its assistance in this field for priority projects in the region.  Leads should be considered, but the team will be expected to rely on their own contacts and background knowledge to explore the sector for appropriate recommendations.  

The date for reciept of proposals remains January 07, 2005

5 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

See attached excerpts from the Eurasia Regional Hydropower Projects in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan Definitional Mission Report.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  USTDA may decide to provide grant funding for a Hydropower Investment Ranking Feasibility Study in Tajikistan after the Technical Assistance on Ranking Hydropower Investment Projects in Tajikistan has been completed.  If approved, the Ministry of Energy would likely be the Grantee and would therefore competitively select a U.S. company to perform the feasibility study.  This potential feasibility study opportunity is estimated at $450,894.  No decisions regarding this grant have been made.
