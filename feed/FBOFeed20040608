<CONTACT>SONJA TWETEN  CONTRACT SPECIALIST  3032369335     sctweten@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Statement of Work I.	Introduction The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) at USGS, Golden CO has the authority and responsibility to produce rapid estimates of earthquake location, magnitude, as well as rapid earthquake shaking intensity and damage maps. This information is given to local, state, and federal, emergency management and civil defense agencies; groups operating critical public facilities such as utilities, power plants, and railroads; government public information channels; local and national and news media; scientific groups and private citizens. To insure the robust delivery of these earthquake-response products as well as enhance their utility, new development, as well as technological advances in data acquisition and communications, must be continually developed and adapted to routine use under the auspices of the Advance National Seismic System (ANSS).  Operation and earthquake response must also continue at a high level, yet ongoing efforts to more fully automate these systems are required. II.	Objective The contractor will participate in the design, implementation, maintenance, and operation of several ANSS real-time product related processing systems.  The work will involve participation in system design, independent design and implementation of subsystems, modification to existing codes and earthquake response operations. Routine testing prior to operation, and continued calibration based on operational knowledge gained will be used to improve responsiveness of the systems to customer needs and USGS objectives. III.	Identification of the Need The ANSS Real-time Product Research and Development Group (RTP) at the USGS, Golden CO is responsible for the design and implementation and operation of rapid post-earthquake information and response tools.  The RTP does not have sufficient staff to complete the operation and maintenance of existing systems as well as development of new required systems in an efficient and timely manner.  RTP is requesting contracting support for design, development, and operation of several specific subsystems. IV.	Statement of Work General Duties: The contractor shall perform specific design and programming tasks in support of the ANSS real-time product development.  These tasks involve: 1) ongoing ShakeMap development and operations, including system upgrades for Anchorage and new regions of the ANSS anticipated to come online, 2) design and implementation of a ShakeMap global system including automated computations of ground motions from finite-fault input, 3) oversight, design, and implementation of the "Did You Feel it?" (DYFI?) system for international response (global earthquakes), and 4) incorporation of the #2) and #3) into a new developing system called Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER).  Validation and publicizing these systems with contributions to publications as well as user and programmer documentation is also required. A.	Software Design and Implementation Tasks Due to the design, implementation, and evolution model used in these projects, the contractor shall be required to participate in occasional design and implementation meetings with the USGS staff at the NEIC in Golden, CO. Is estimated there will  be at least two such meetings per year during the course of this contract. The design and implementation tasks for this contract include: 1.	Alaska ShakeMap System operation and development: a) On-call ShakeMap response for significant Alaska earthquakes; continuing calibration of system and triggering adjustments, b) Development of either Anchorage zoom capacity (high resolution maps, topography and triggering specifics) or dual zoom/regional maps depending on regional coordinators decisions, c) coordination with regional network coordinators, and d) ongoing regional scenario development as requested. Additional development for regional ShakeMap systems will be required but the schedule and progress of these systems depends on other network operators, so flexibility is required. 2.	ShakeMap development on Global ShakeMap: a) Collect and organize worldwide base map data including cities, topography, road, and other geographic features, d) Collect region-specific attenuation modules for global coverage and program in to ShakeMap-specific regression PERL modules, and e) Automatically retrieve and process finite fault models as they become available (and update appropriate event).  3.	DYFI development: a) Global system, requiring automatic city and latitude/longitude assignments, b) Test automated location and magnitude determination for central and eastern U.S., c) Development of dual English/Spanish version and test for Puerto Rico, and d) Interact and advice student assistant on other aspect of the DYFI project, as needed. 4.	Software design, interfacing and development in collaboration with PAGER development team for implementing the National Earthquake Information Center's new tools for global earthquake evaluation, including direct transfer shaking results from Global ShakeMap to the PAGER system. 5.	Ongoing operation and general maintenance of DYFI and ShakeMap systems (triggering, web page security & 508 compliance, etc.) as needed. This includes response to significant earthquakes, which may require unanticipated or emergency modifications as needed for unanticipated post-earthquake occurrences. 6.	Documentation and publication of enhancements and software details, including further work on the ShakeMap Manual, and documentation for PAGER, DYFI? and others systems as requested by COR. B.	Operational Tasks The operational tasks include: 1.	ShakeMap response for significant earthquakes Nationwide, including Alaska. Post-earthquake response includes customer service, data processing and making these data available and responding to inquires.  2.	DYFI? response for all triggered earthquakes nationwide; worldwide when this becomes operational. 3.	Operational response and guidance for new operators of PAGER, ShakeMap, and DYFI? systems within the USGS, NEIC, and collaborating institutions.  4.	Aid in specific earthquake response and follow up as requested by COR. C.	Support Activities Support tasks shall include: 1.	Interact with and respond to queries with users and other developers. 2.	Provide operational and bug fix assistance as requested by COR. V.	Deliverables The contractor shall be required to provide a written or verbal report on progress approximately once per week.  The COR shall keep a log of the dates and content of these verbal reports.  From these meetings or discussions, the contractor's design and implementation work on active tasks shall be reviewed with the project manager in the context of the project design goals and interface standards.  Priorities and coordination of the schedule with other elements of the project development will be discussed and milestones will be established as needed.  At the conclusion of each task, the contractor shall demonstrate that the software operates correctly and shall provide source code integrated existing ShakeMap, DYFI? and other systems, test results if appropriate, and provide documentation. The COR will inspect all materials delivered to the government under this contract and determine that they are complete and that the documentation is adequate.  The COR will issue a short memorandum either accepting or not accepting the materials delivered.  If the materials are deemed unacceptable, the COR will provide complete information detailing the shortcomings.  The contractor will be given two weeks from the date of such a memorandum, to correct the shortcoming at no cost to the government.  All software developed under this contract shall become the property of the U. S. Government.  As this is a level of effort contract, there will be no hard and fast due dates, but the contractor must show reasonable and steady progress in meeting milestones as determined by the COR from the weekly and quarterly reports.  The COR will monitor the availability of the contractor during scheduled work hours.  The COR will document instances of unacceptable work, unreasonably slow progress, and/or consistent absence of the contractor which may, at the option of the government, be grounds for contract cancellation. VI.	Milestones Milestones given below are meant to provide a rough indication of when the completion of tasks is planned.  These milestones may be have to be adjusted based on changes in priorities, as result of current and future mission goals and the availability of resources or due to required and timely responses to significant earthquakes. Base Year (FY04-05): It is planned that software design and implementation task 1 shall be completed during the base year, and significant progress (approximately 75%) on tasks 2 and 3 shall be made.  First Option Year (FY05-06): Contractor shall complete task 3, and task 4 shall be initiated and completed at the 50% level. Second Option Year (FY06-07): Contractor shall complete tasks 4 & 6. In all years, it is expected that progress on tasks 5 and 6 shall be reached at the 50% level.

West Virginia Stateside Addressing and Mapping Board (WVSAMB) is uniquely positioned to provide current, accurate, high-resolution digital elevation data for the State of West Virginia. The statewide high resolution mass points and break lines produced by the WVSAMB mapping program will be the source base data for populating the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED), which is the elevation component of The National Map. The WVSAMB is the only known source that can provide the required statewide digital elevation data at this time. There are no other known sources currently possessing data that statewide, and are this current, or at this resolution. In order to use this elevation source to populate the USGS NED, the data must first be reformatted to grid format that can be ingested into the NED. The pilot project for this data reformatting function will be performed by the West Virginia GIS Technical Center (Tech Center). The tech center uniquely suited to this task due to its status as the official agent of the West Virginia GIS coordinator, who is also the manager of the WVSAMB. This recognition enables the Tech Center to have access to the otherwise restricted access elevation data. The U.S. Geological Survey anticipates awarding this to West Virginia Technical Center.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is 06/18/2004.  NAICS is 334611 and SIC is 7372.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: abenton@usgs.gov by 06/18/2004.  No additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>Availability of Solicitation The solicitation for the Center of Excellence for Airliner Cabin Environment Research is now available. The solicitation can be found at http://www.coe.faa.gov/ The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to establish an Air Transportation Center of Excellence (COE) for Airliner Cabin Environment Research.

To this end, the FAA is soliciting proposals from accredited institutions of higher education addressing the establishment of the aforementioned COE. The FAA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team members and thereafter award grants and delivery order contract(s) consisting of cost reimbursement, cost sharing, and/or fixed price. The FAA intends to invest $1,000,000 in the first year and a minimum of $500,000 per year for the next two years of the COE.

<DESC>The Department of Defense is moving towards platforms and weapons systems exploiting electrical power in new ways.  To reach the envisioned capabilities in electric propulsion and weapons in a tactical configuration, advances are deemed necessary in the solid state power electronics used to distribute, condition, and regulate the electrical power.

In support of these thrusts, under phase II and III of the Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Technology High Power Electronics (WBST-HPE) program DARPA is interested in receiving innovative research proposals that drive high power electronics component performance to levels deemed enabling for DoD applications.  The development is deemed most suited to exploiting the unique material properties of silicon carbide (SiC) materials to demonstrate revolutionary power electronics performance.  The research area of interest is focused on high voltage (greater than or equal to 10 kV) components where the benefit of SiC technology is most evident.  Furthermore, high switching frequency is essential to enable the reduction in the size and weight of the passive components in the power conversion circuit.  In addition, low on-state resistance and forward voltage drop are critical to minimize on-state losses in the power converter.  Finally, an elevated junction temperature operating capability up to at least 200 degrees C is deemed important to further reduce the size of the cooling sub-system. 

DARPA is particularly interested in developing the power electronics device technology deemed necessary to enable solid state power substations (SSPS) for future Navy warships.  Current distribution approaches being considered for the next generation of carriers and destroyers employ a 13.8 kV AC power distribution that is stepped down to 450 V AC by using large (6 ton and 10 cubic meters) 2.7 MVA transformers.  The advanced power electronic components of interest under this effort should enable the realization of a solid state power substation (SSPS) that converts the distributed 13.8 kV AC power down to 450 V AC at the same total power level (2.7 MVA) as the current system.  This solicitation seeks to develop the semiconductor components for such an SSPS.  Future solicitations are envisioned to support work to develop high frequency transformers, control electronics, and complete SSPS integration.

The goal of this solicitation is to support the research and development necessary to realize the semiconductor components, switches and diodes, required to demonstrate the viability of the SSPS concept.

This solicitation seeks to exploit recent advances in SiC substrates and epitaxy quality demonstrated under Phase I of DARPA’s Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Technology High Power Electronics Program (WBST HPE: BAA01-035).  Under the WBST HPE phase I program, critical SiC material metrics were demonstrated that are deemed necessary to enable large area (i. e. 1 square centimeter), high total power device work.  These metrics included: 4H n-type SiC 75 mm wafers with a micropipe density less than 1 inverse square centimeter, catastrophic defect density after 100 micron epitaxy less than 1.5 inverse square centimeter, forward voltage drop in 10 kV PIN diode less than 4 V and stable over 100 hours; and on-state resistance of 10 kV SiC MOSFET less than 0.25 ohm-square centimeter.  This level of material capability is deemed necessary for successful execution of the device research described under this BAA 04-28.  

Small area devices consistent with the goals of this solicitation have been demonstrated in limited quantity, and offerors should clearly include their previous work in this area.  However, earlier demonstrations have not been consistent with a robust device process and high total power handling capability.  Therefore, this effort seeks to move beyond single device demonstrations to critical research and development of advanced components and will evaluate the feasibility of this technology in a manufacturing environment. 

For the advanced power electronics technology to transition into DoD systems, or commercial applications, the reliability of the components must be established.  As part of this solicitation, offerors must include a plan for assessing the component reliability consistent with the SSPS application and accepted industrial practice.  Of particular interest, is identifying and eliminating any variation in component performance occurring as a function of time, temperature, current, or high voltage operation. 

This solicitation addresses Phase II and III of the WBST-HPE program with each phase being 
18 months in duration.  If this schedule is not deemed appropriate by the offeror, an alternative program schedule that achieves the identified goals program goals in a more expeditious fashion should be proposed.  

PROGRAM SCOPE 

Awards totaling $30 to $50 million over three years are expected to be made in the first half of the federal fiscal year 2005.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are highly encouraged.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR 
IRS KANSAS CITY CAMPUS CONSOLIDATION 
Solicitation Number:  GS06P04GZC0006
Main Post Office, 315 W. Pershing Road, Kansas City, Missouri.

Pre-Solicitation Notice.  This solicitation is set aside for exclusive small business participation, in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.  The NAICS code is 236620, and the small business size standard is $28,500,000.  Offers received from business concerns that do not qualify as a small business concern shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected.  

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a Construction Management (CM) contractor for GSA’s IRS Kansas City Campus Consolidation at the Main Post Office, 315 W. Pershing Road, Kansas City, Missouri.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, specifications, the solicitation provisions, the proposal submittal requirements and the evaluation factors.  The RFP will be issued on or about June 23, 2004.  Estimated cost range is $1,000,000 -- $4,000,000 for the base year and up to three option years.  The options will be exercised if the Government chooses, and if the CM contractor’s performance is satisfactory.  Award is expected to be made in August 2004 for the base year.  This contract is limited to only those firms having an existing CM services contracting office in the state of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri or Nebraska and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice. Additional preference will be given to those firms having an existing CM services contracting office in the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice.  The SMSA includes the Kansas counties of Franklin, Johnson, Leavenworth, Linn, Miami, and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Bates, Caldwell, Cass, Clay, Clinton, Jackson, Lafayette, Platte, and Ray. Contractors working with or for the Developer/Lessor or its subcontractors will not be allowed to compete in this solicitation.

The existing Main Post Office has been acquired by DST Realty as Developer/Lessor.  The building will be completely renovated.  The Government, as Lessee, is contracting for a 1,140,000 rentable square foot lease. The remaining square feet and parking will be build-to-suit.  GSA will manage the Lessor/Developer’s performance of the lease requirements.  The selected CM will be responsible for the following activities, which are not limited to:  design; procurement; construction; and post-construction phase services.  Design phase services include design reviews of the drawings and specifications; verification that the completed design complies with GSA standards, applicable codes, and is within the scope of work identified for the project.  Construction phase services include inspection of work performed by the general contractor for conformity with contract requirements; monitoring review and approval of submittals required by the contract documents; monitoring the budget for the entire project to maintain an accurate cost picture of the project; providing reports comparing budgeted costs with current cost estimates; and reviewing Lessor’s cost estimates to ensure the project can be completed with available funds.  This phase also includes review and monitoring of the schedule; chairing meetings and maintaining meeting minutes; preparing reports; notifying GSA of problems and issues that arise; and providing independent cost estimates for lease contract modifications.  Post-construction phase services include deficiencies and omissions inspections, maintaining as-built drawings; and support for other post-construction phase activities. 

GSA anticipates the award of a negotiated firm fixed price contract using source selection procedures to obtain the greatest value for the Government.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating technical qualification factors specified in the solicitation, and then price, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications are more important than price.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage one will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage two will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  Technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in order of importance:  1)  Past Performance of the firm; 2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and 3) Management Plan.   Proposals will first be evaluated for technical qualifications.  After all proposals have been evaluated for technical qualifications, price proposals will be opened and separately evaluated.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors.  However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals and establish a competitive range if necessary.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval.   

In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications) and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact; 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code; 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number; 
4.	Your Telephone Number; and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official plan holders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

A pre-proposal conference is not anticipated.  Proposals shall be received at GSA on or about July 23, 2004.  Specific date, time and location shall be specified in the RFP, expected to be available when the solicitation is posted on www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 23, 2004.

Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  

The RFP specification will be available by link via the Solicitation.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the proposal documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Doug Benton, at 816-823-4601, or fax at (816) 823-5906.

<DESC>The USNS Zeus (T-ARC-7) has an obsolete auxiliary boilers' combustion control causing maintenance and operational difficulties.  Military Sealift Command (MSC) has decided to replace the existing ACC boiler control system with a modern PLC type (boiler control) combustion control system.

The COTS boiler system shall be in accordance with all ABS, USCG and MSC guidelines.  The new system will be reliable, durable and applicable for future improvements and have service accessibility.  The hardware and software for the boiler control system design shall be factory tested by the contractor before installation and be ABS/USCG approved.  The contractor will also test the boiler control system for the proper operation after installation.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside.  The solicitation will be issued on or before December 19 and will be made available on the MSC website. (N00033-04-R-8005 was originally posted as N00033-04-T-9012 on 5 December 2003.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Diving Unlimited International (DUI), 1148 Delevan Dr. San Diego Ca., for the procurement of eight (8) tubesuit/drysuits.  The tubesuit/drysuit combination is designed to keep a diver warm in cold water.  The tubesuit allows hot/warm water to be pumped around the divers skin, helping maintain diver body temperature.  The drysuit provides insulation to minimize loss of body heat.  The suit manufactured by Diving Unlimited International (DUI) is the only manufacturer which allows sufficient flow (.5 gallons per minute with a 20 psi inlet pressure) to keep the diver warm during testing of a NSWC/USNA system.  Note that these suits are being used for test and evaluation of a NSWC/USNA developed diver-heating system.  While they are an integral part of the test, they are not, themselves, bein g tested.  DUI suits were used in the prior tests of the NSWC/USNA system  and  use of another tubesuit/drysuit for testing may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may invalidate/alter the test data compative analysis.   NAICS  code 339920 applies.  SBA size standard is 500 employees.  FSC is 4220.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00305, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal  Acquisition Circular 01-22.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of  this solicitation.   This procurement is for the analysis of up to 96 samples of water containing either monomethyltin (MMT) or dimethyltin (DMT) for the Neorotoxicology Division, US EPA, NHEERL.  Analysis of methyltin species (MMT, DMT, and trimethyltin [TMT]) as well as total tin will be required at specific time  points after preparation of the water solutions, as specified below.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price for the full analysis of all 96 samples.  The contractor is required to submit a pre-award Quality Management Plan consistent with the specifications contained in document EPA/QAR-2  EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans. No award may be given until and unless the Quality Assurance Manager and the Project Officer agree as to the conditions of that plan. EPA/QAR-2 can be downloaded from EPA's Quality Staff  Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/quality) under "Documents".  The  contractor is required to submit a Quality Assurance Project Plan consistent with the conditions of document EPA/QAR-5 EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans. The QAPP must be submitted and approved by the QAM and the Project Officer prior to work beginning on the project but is not a  pre-award condition. EPA/QAR-5 can be downloaded from EPA's Quality Staff Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/quality) under "Documents".  Contractor shall provide laboratory testing services to the EPA in accordance with the Description of Services.  Specimens are to be collected by the EPA, and the  Contractor shall arrange for shipment.  Due to the uncertain stability of the compounds, the samples must be picked up within 15 minutes of preparation in the EPA  laboratory, and analysis or stabilization (for later analysis) made within 30  minutes.  Alternatively, water samples may be  immediately frozen to stabilize the organotin species, and picked up by the Contractor at a later time.  The actual specimen collections will take place over one week.  To allow for analysis verification and post-collection analyses, the period of performance is 12 months from the date the contract  is awarded. The Contractor shall designate a Study Manager and provide contact information (telephone, email, postal address).  The Study Manager shall coordinate communications between EPA and the Contractor analytical laboratory, supply necessary forms, and oversee execution of performance for  the Contractor. Description of Services:  Analysis of the organotin concentrations (total tin and methyltin species) in drinking water studies is needed to verify dose levels used in animal studies.  Stability of two organotin compounds, monomethyl and dimethyl  tin, will be measured over several  days, under conditions of use equivalent to the animal study.  All solutions will be made and stored at the US EPA laboratory, and transferred to the contractor for analyses according to the following timeline.  There will be a stock solution which will be kept in the freezer, and dilutions made  from that stock will be kept in water bottles in the animal room, suspended on empty cages.  For each solution, analysis shall be conducted immediately after preparation, 6 hours later, and again at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, to allow a time-course for stability.  Samples of the stock will be analyzed  immediately after preparation and at 2 and 4 days.  In addition, water stored in a used bottle shall be analyzed to determine whether tin compounds may have adsorbed to the sides.  Analysis at each time point  shall include actual quantity of monomethyl (MMT), dimethyl (DMT), and trimethyl tin  (TMT), as well as total tin (Sn).  The solutions will be made on a Monday, and sampling will take place each day (Friday=day 4) that week.  The Contractor is free to choose the analytical method most appropriate for this contract.  Literature citations for this type of analysis are included in  References.    However, the methodology must be capable of identifying and quantifying the methyltin and butyltin species at relatively low  concentrations (limits of detection no more than 0.1% of nominal concentrations).  Recommended methods include LC or GC (requiring derivitization) followed by  MS identification of species.  Numerous papers in the literature describe these methodologies (cited below).  SOPs for GC/MS  analysis are available from the contact person at EPA.  The Contractor must fully describe the proposed analytical techniques with supporting documentation of capabilities  and anticipated recovery/limits of detection. All solutions will be maintained at the EPA's Environmental Research Center laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC.   Water should be picked up from the EPA facility by the Contractor or courier, delivered to the Contractor's laboratory where the  assays will be performed, and analyzed within 30 minutes of sample collection.  Alternatively, water samples may be immediately frozen to stabilize the organotin species, and shall be picked up from the EPA facility by the Contractor or courier, and delivered to the Contractor's laboratory where  the assays will be performed at a later time.  Contractor shall perform the assays, verify the accuracy of the results with concurrent standard curves and control samples, and report the results, including data from which the standard curves are derived, to the EPA in writing and electronically in  the  form of a PC-based spreadsheet (e.g., Excel?) or ASCII file.   1. Initial recovery / feasibility studies.  Contractor shall undertake feasibility studies to determine recovery of methyltin species in spiked water solutions.  Recovery will be reported to EPA prior to shipping samples with  unknown concentrations.   2. Stability study of water solutions.  Solutions and sampling times are listed in the table show in the Statement of Work at the EPA website.  Contractor shall work with EPA to determine the appropriate sample size for each sample.  Contractor shall provide bottles for  sample collection in consultation with EPA.  This actual collection of samples will take 1 week.  3. Contractor shall perform analysis for concentrations of MMT, DMT, TMT, and total tin in each water sample.  4. EPA will work with the  Contractor to schedule the stability study as described above.   5. The assays shall be conducted within 30 minutes of receipt at the analytical laboratory.  Alternatively, the samples may be stabilized/derivitized immediately for later analysis.  Final analysis shall be conducted within 2 weeks and results of the assays shall be reported by Contractor to the  EPA project officer.  The results shall include:  a. Values obtained for the recovery and quantitation of methyltin species, including limits of detection.  b. A table listing the tissue sample number and the calculated concentration of each methyltin and total tin in mg/L, as well as results of  control samples run in the analytical laboratory for verification of accuracy of the assay.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.   Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a)  of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES CRITERIA:  a) Provide a copy of the Quality Management Plan in accordance with the Statement of Work.  b) Describe the proposed analytical techniques with supporting documentation of capabilities and anticipated recovery/limits of  detection.  c) Ability to meet time line for the project; (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE:  Provide 3 references of customers for whom like or similar analysis have been performed.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY--FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of deployable flight simulators for aircrew training purposes.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of mobile simulators to allow deployed aircrew to maintain currency in flight operations and aircraft weapons systems.  The envisioned system should utilize a typical desktop/laptop Personal Computer (PC) as its base, with provisions for a generic joystick-and-throttle or simple weapons station console as the primary input devices.  Given that capability, Combat Air Forces could improve aircrew readiness and decrease the amount of flying training missions to maintain currency.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.

The AEFB is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating a system that can provide currency and new-system-familiarity training to personnel already qualified on the airframe.  The system would be PC-based, with no or minimal custom peripherals.  While the intent is to eventually adapt this system to a variety of airframes, the initial requirement is for training on the B-1B Lancer airframe, to include new offensive and defensive weapon systems and current block upgrades.  Peripherals for the Pilot/Co-pilot stations would consist of a simple joystick-and-throttle, while the Weapons System Officer stations would require a simplified panel sufficient to provide basic familiarity for current and future weapons systems.

Request information is submitted NO LATER THAN 9 Jul 2004 to Capt. Craig Waylan, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Capt. Waylan can be reached at (208) 828-1014.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) is the developer of the BackUp Fuel Switch (BUFS) in the T-45A aircraft.  Currently, the location of the switch leaves it susceptible to damage and inadvertent contact, leading to unintended selection of the manual fuel system.  Therefore, NAVAIR intends to issue a sole source contract to MDC to redesign the BUFS in accordance with the approved design solution. See Note 22.

<DESC>This shall serve as the official pre-solicitation notice by Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI) for a project to design, develop and test a prototype compact portable remote terminal (PRT) to provide the employee in charge (EIC) of railroad roadway workers a wireless, functional link to the train control system 
An outcome of the design portion Positive Train Control (PTC) Development has been recognition of the potential benefits of an Employee in Charge (EIC) to transmit and receive information with PTC system via an easily portable remote terminal (PRT), such as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) personal data assistant. The PRT needs to be portable and hand-held, rather than anchored to a vehicle, because the EIC often needs to establish/maintain communication with the PTC system while away from a vehicle and involved in maintenance of way activities .  However, the EIC vehicle could host, if needed, a gateway for the PRT to communicate with the larger PTC network. The improved communication between the EIC and the PTC system has the potential to improve both the safety and productivity of roadway worker operations.  
Phase I of the project has developed a high level functional requirements and desirable hardware characteristics document for the device and a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) document.  These documents will be provided to prospective offerors who respond to this notice.  
Phase II, which is the subject of this notice, will design, build, demonstrate and test a prototype EIC PRT. Conceptually, there are many possible architectures for the EIC portable terminal.  For example, it might have a wireless link to a roadway worker terminal (RWT) in the EIC's nearby vehicle.  The EIC portable terminal could then communicate with the CBTC system either interacting with the RWT's applications or by using the RWT as merely a gateway to the CBTC system. Alternatively, the portable terminal may use a longer range data link (if available) to communicate with the office applications over the railroad’s network, avoiding having to be relayed through a RWT.  Another concept has the portable terminal replacing the RWT entirely with a dockable hand-held device that can be removed from the EIC’s vehicle when needed, while maintaining real time wireless communications with the PTC system.  
Interested and qualified prospective offerors must reply to this notice (see point of contact below) requesting a copy of the Request for Information and Request for Expression of Interest (RFI EOI) document no later than the Response Date above.  
The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this work effort will be sent only to parties determined to be qualified based their responses to the RFI EOI, which are due July 2, 2004.   The requirements for responses are specified in the RFI EOI document and include as a minimum: 1) showing understanding of the scope of the project; 2) providing rough estimates of time and cost to do the work; 3) organization capacity and qualification for conducting work of this nature including professional qualifications of the staff, and 4) documentation of previous similar experience including: a) evidence of a proven track record of providing customer satisfaction in performance of similar projects, b) description and volume of this specialized experience within the past 5 years, c) applicable customer contact information with customer performance evaluations on relevant projects, and d) evidence of familiarity with Positive Train Control and North American intercity freight and passenger railroad operations.
If funded, this work will receive Federal funding.  Prospective offerors must comply with flow-down provisions associated with 49CFR part 19 and TTCI General Articles of Contract, all of which will be incorporated into the RFP, as well as the resulting award document.   Neither this notice or the RFI EOI document constitute a guarantee that a project will be funded or awarded.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Norma M. Martinez, 505 678-3481
<DESC>The Army Contract Agency, White Sands Missile Range, Directorate of Contracting intends to solicit for a Joint Mobile Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) Testing System (JMITS). The JMITS will be utilized by DoD to improve its testing capabilities of aircraft self-protection systems against IR missiles.  These capabilities have failed to keep pace with the advanced technology incorporated into the IR warning and countermeasure sys tems in operational use.  Due to these shortfalls, state-of-the-art missile attack warning and countermeasures equipment cannot be adequately tested when installed on the actual aircraft.  Furthermore, the Services lack adequate resources for providing the  proper training environment in this area.  In addition to posing a threat to military aircraft, these IR missiles threaten civilian aircraft which have either inadequate or no IR warning or countermeasure systems at all.  JMITS will be designed such that all current and projected IRCM systems can be tested. JMITS will resolve shortcomings of existing simulators as identified by a Tri-Service, DOT&E sponsored, E2E Test Working Group documented in the Ã¢Â€ÂœFinal Report For Installed End-To-End Testing of IRCM SystemsÃ¢Â€Â dated January 2004.  The three most s ignificant shortcomings are: 1) Insufficient output power for testing fixed wing installations, 2) Inadequate characterization and assessment of the return jam beam for deriving system effectiveness, and 3) Lack of auto-tracking capability for remote opera tion.   Major JMITS components include: 1) A high quality auto/manual tracking mount, 2) A missile simulator that transmits threat representative UV and IR missile signatures, 3) IR radiometers that characterize the return laser jam beams, 4) Static threat seeker suite in reactive configuration, 5) MANPAD acquisition system and visual cueing, 6) A UV/IR radiometric suite for system calibration and measurement of missile and false alarm source signatures, and 7) An atmospheric measurement suite for characterizing at mospheric conditions.  Each JMITS will be a self-contained unit such that all equipment can be transportable and re-locatable to any test site.  Under this effort, two (2) JMITS units will be built with appropriate spares purchased and operator/maintenance  training provided.   This action is being conducted as full and open competition.  The NAICS code assigned is 541330 and has a dollar amount of 23 Million.    The solicitation will be published on our webpage during the week of June 21st 2004 at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpag e/pages/sol_stat.htm.   Contractors are encouraged to team-up with other contractors to include small businesses.  The ultimate goal is to award a contract to support CCM in this R&D program.  We anticipate the award to be made in October 2004.

POC:  James Perretta, AFRL/SNRT Program Manager, telephone: 315-330-2632; e-mail: James.Perretta@rl.af.mil.  Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, AFRL/IFKA, telephone:  315-330-4777; e-mail:  Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  The AFRL Sensors Directorate at Rome Research Site is soliciting proposals for various studies, capabilities and experiments which bring together enabling technology base and system concepts at a combined state-of-the-art level greater than currently available.  The desired overall result is to identify technologies and credible enabling system concepts considering non-traditional RF technologies that can be more fully explored in the early stages of potential new programs.  Resultant concepts and technology roadmaps may be presented to AFRL for possible inclusion in future programs.  This is a four (4) year Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit Research and Development (R & D) proposals for advanced RF networking techniques.  The following areas have been identified as important for developing high-capacity networking systems while integrating new and advanced technology:  Development of research and interaction between Government and industry to bring together both technology base and system concepts for advanced sensing and communication systems.  Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY03.  Individual awards will normally range from 1 to 12 months in duration with amounts normally ranging up to $500K per year.  Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $4 M.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2007.  At this time it is anticipated that up to ten (10) awards for $15K - $20K each, will be made for conducting research and presenting findings at a workshop on the subject of 60 GHz communication systems.  Each contract will have a period of performance of three (3) months.  Participation in the workshop will entail preparation of concepts, and technology roadmaps for candidate 60 GHz technologies.  The performers need to identify enabling technology and have a credible set of enabling system concepts that can be more fully explored in the early stages of a new start program.  This approach is essential for considering non-traditional RF technologies, such as quasi-optical, optical beam forming and two terminal devices.  Awardees will prepare concepts, objectives and technology roadmaps which will be presented at a workshop.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  Offerors are required to submit (3) copies of a two (2) to five (5) page proposal. All proposals submitted in response to this PRDA must be addressed to:  AFRL/SNRT, ATTN: James Perretta, Reference PRDA 03-14-IFKA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. A copy of the Rome "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. It is recommended that proposals for the initial FY03 awards be received by 30 Jun 03 to maximize the possibility of award.    Proposals will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available after the specified date.    Additional areas of interest and the dates for submission of proposals will be posted from time to time as requirements are identified.  All responsible firms may submit proposals which shall be considered. Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-14-IFKA. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal; (b)  The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, and (c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.  Also, consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA will be used.  No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. In addition, the work to be performed may require a secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, in those instances, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at time of award. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.

<SOLNBR>T6ATSC
<RESPDATE>070904
<ARCHDATE>12312004
<CONTACT>Dan Lueking,(937)904-4247
<DESC>T-6A Technical Sustainment Contract The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright- Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on T- 6A Aircraft Product Enhancement Contract of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We  anticipate a 5-year contract with contract award in accordance with Federal  Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than Oct 2005.    T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 5-year follow-on (through FY 2010), there will be  a total of 782 aircraft in the field stationed at these four MOBs and these  additional bases: Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB,  Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.  Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered  and the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 (See Attachment 1) that will involve (but are not  limited to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.   At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) is the sole provider for studies,  analysis, and the development of all corrections of deficiencies and/or product  improvements.  RAC also provides all maintenance support for the government’s  prototype aircraft (PT-4), crash damage repairs, and System/Sustainment  Engineering Support for the T-6A Ground Based Training System (GBTS).     Product Enhancement Contract Description The product enhancement contract will procure:; 1.	Future studies and analysis against aircraft and ground-based training  equipment deficiencies and product enhancements.   2.	Over and above maintenance support for the prototype aircraft located  at Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), Wichita, KS. 3.	Support for the development of new product enhancements for the T-6A  training system. 4.	Five years of crash damage repair as required for any fielded aircraft. 5.	Onsite field service representatives at main operating bases to assist  in maintenance support. 6.	Navy Aircraft spares outside the typical COMBS support contract. 7.	Engine Structural Integrity Program and Aircraft Structural Integrity  Program support. 8.	GBTS Integration + Systems Engineering support. 9.	Parts Obsolescence management 10.	Engineering Dedicated Support for deficiency reports, strategy  planning, and miscellaneous program management planning. There is no intention to breakout these tasks separately.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for continuing the development of the Virtual At-Sea Training (VAST)family of combat training and mission rehearsal systems.  The current focus of VAST is on development of a portable air ASW training system, called the Mission Rehearsal Tactical Team Trainer (MRT3) that supports the enhancement and maintenance of tactical team training skills for all nodes in  battlegroup ASW, including SH-60s, P3s, IUSS assets, and AX nodes.  The proposed action is to carry out applied research to upgrade the multiple SH-60B MRT3 to ensure the long-term reliability and usability during deployed training  and to upgrade existing MRT3 devices to ensure expandability to additional platforms when called upon to do so.  This research effort requires the performer to have extensive expertise in modeling and simulation for military training, in Fleet needs and requirements related to integrated air ASW training,  and specifically with the MRT3 system that has been developed over the past two years with ONR and JFCOM funding. It is ONR's intention to negotiate this on a sole source basis with BMH Associates Inc, Norfolk, VA.  The period of performance will be nine (9) months. Any capability statements should be submitted to Susan Parrott, Fax (703)696-0993, E-mail susan_parrott@onr.navy.mil, or via mail to Office of Naval Research, BCT 1 ONR 254: SKP, 800 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22217-5660.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIE TIME.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  The National Park Service is researching the availability of sources to provide non-invasive 3D laser scanning of fragile and unique prehistoric and historic archeological resources to produce geo-referenced, 3.0 cm-1.0 mm resolution digital organic models to be used for general management planning and visualization of the site/structure and associated elements in a 3D digital environment; the development of interpretive aids, i.e., digital video clips; to obtain accurate, basic metric data (measurements, areas, and volumes) from the digital models, and multiple types of analyses such as the intra and interspatial relationships of the site, features, and the immediate landscape.  In addition to having the experience and equipment necessary to complete the 3D laser scanning, due to the unique nature of these fragile, non-renewable resources, the contractor should also be capable of providing qualified archeological staff with experience in archeological and architectural documentation, assessment, and digital cartography.  Contractor must also be able to demonstrate the specific field methodologies and techniques to be used in order to mitigate potential site impacts and ensure the required precision and attribute information necessary to present the archeological/architectural data in complex database environments.  Contractor may also be required to develop park specific end-products which may include incorporating existing data sets such as photographs, recordation forms, as well as utilizing other technologies (digital photography, RTK, GPS, and GPR).  Sources capable of providing the units with ALL the requirements listed must submit product information and price lists to Trish Fresquez-Hernandez, National Park Service, P. O. Box 728, Santa Fe, NM 87504-0728 or trish_fresquez-hernandez@nps.gov no later than June 23, 2004.

<RESPDATE>030904
<CONTACT>Kimberly Knott, Contract Specialist, Phone 334-953-6242, Fax 334-953-2198, Email kimberly.knott@maxwell.af.mil - Kimberly Knott, Contract Specialist, Phone 334-953-6242, Fax 334-953-2198, Email kimberly.knott@maxwell.af.mil
<DESC>Description: This is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only.  The RFI is for enhancing Air University’s Library (AUL) MARC records, to include table of contents information, and possibly author information, to be delivered in MARC standard format.  AUL is using Voyager’s Endeavor system, and is interested in a vendor with experience with Endeavor, so that such enhanced records would be accepted by our system.  Our current release of the Endeavor system-cataloging module is Version 2001.2.1 Build 3302 (production version).

SUGGESTED OUTLINE FOR RESPONSES:  
1) Address the process by which AUL would submit MARC records for enhancement, and the vendor would then enhance such records and resend to AUL for inclusion in the Endeavor system.  
2) What is the cost per record?   
3) What is the turn around time? 
4) Does the process add 505, 520 and perhaps 040 subfield to indicate the source of the record, without changing other fields within the record?  (The latter is of supreme importance, as we do not wish to have the other fields in the records overwritten when we load the updated records into our system.) If the AUL record already has a 505 or 520, is the field replaced, or is an additional 505 or 520 added to the record?  
5) Is the match based on ISBN, with the LCCN number as the secondary match point if there is no ISBN?  
6) Many records have multiple records, such as for the hardcover and the paperback.  Does this cause problems, or cause the system to generate two matches for which we would be charged twice, or is there a mechanism in place which would preclude that?  
7) When the records come back to the library, is there any sort of report that indicates which records have been enhanced, and which have not?  
7a) What staff creates the enhancements, or are the records purchased from elsewhere?  7b) What is the approximate number of titles for which such enhanced records are currently available from the vendor, and what is an approximation of the number of titles for which enhanced records are added per year?
7c) How could we find out how many of our records have enhanced records available through the vendor?  
7d) Could we send some sort of file, perhaps broken down by periods of copyright years, in order to obtain such pricing?  (Example would be all records for books with copyright dates from 2000 to the present, in order to determine not just a cost per record, but what the cost for our particular records would be, based on actual rather than estimated matches.) Please highlight any contract vehicles/schedules available to streamline any potential solicitation.  After responses are reviewed, the contractor may be required to provide a demonstration at no additional cost to the Government.

The Government has the right to use any of the information provided by contractors to develop our solicitation.  If an offeror objects to this, do not submit the information. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Although “proposal” and “offer” are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  Again, this synopsis is issued for the purpose of INFORMATION and PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  Responses will be accepted in any format by 1200 PM CST on Mar 9, 2004, to TSgt Kimberly Knott. Phone (334)953-6242; fax (334)953-2198.

<DESC>The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking possible sources for chiller water piping work to be done at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy at Beaver, West Virginia.
Work includes, but is not limited to the description below(*).  The purpose of this notice is to obtain “ballpark estimates” for budgetary purposes to be used to develop a request for proposals (RFP) or request for quotes (RFQ).  Estimates, which will remain confidential, are to be submitted subsequently to an on site visit, to be scheduled on an agreeable date to interested parties.  
NOTE:  No more than two alternate dates will be scheduled.

Interested parties should submit a company profile, including such information as technical and management capabilities and a list of previous/current projects of a similar nature.

Interested parties may respond electronically by close of business June 18, 2004 to och.william@dol.gov or fax to 304-256-3332 or mail information to MSHA, William Och, 1301 Airport Road, Beaver WV  25813.

(*)The air-conditioning system currently in use at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy located in Beaver, West Virginia utilizes a chilled water system with return and supply lines from the Chiller Room located in the B-Building Section of the  complex.  The pipe that was originally installed was malleable iron.  During
the last 28 years, the insulation on the pipes has broken down, which allows the vapor barrier to be lost and causes a sweating problem with the piping in A-Building.

In A-Building, which is the Dormitory Wing of the Academy complex, the air-conditioning system is in operation 24/7 during the summer months.  The pipes and fittings are deteriorating presenting  a hazard and could begin leaking.  A leak in the air-conditioning system could require a complete shutdown of the Dormitory Wing .  As a result, the dormitory rooms would be out of service until repairs could be completed.

The malleable iron pipe will be replaced with copper pipe and insulated.  Considerable demolition of the sheetrock walls is necessary to gain access to the piping.  The services of carpenters, sheetrock workers, and painters are required for repairs to the sheetrock walls located in the dormitory rooms and hallways in A-Building.

The pipe has been replaced in two levels of this building during fiscal year 2003, with approximately one-third of the work completed.  We are now interested in obtaining a “budgetary” quote from various companies to complete this project.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH, NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Fire Support Systems (FSS) Marine Corps.

Mission objective:  To identify and evaluate current or near-term precision Non-Magnetic Azimuth Sensor solutions available to the Marine Corps and select those that will provide the best pay-off for improving the precision capability currently being employed. 

Current capabilities and limitations:  Forward Observers, Forward Air Controllers, and Reconnaissance Units employ the Vector 21B man portable laser rangefinders to aid in the determination of accurate target location.  These laser rangefinders use an eye-safe laser and an internal digital magnetic compass (DMC) to determine range, azimuth, and vertical angle from the user’s location to the target location.  These measurements are then transmitted to a Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) or Rugged Hand-held Computer (RHC) using targeting software via a RS-232 interface cable.  Once received at the PLGR or RHC, the operator is able to determine target location with respect to a 10 digit grid coordinate system.  Operation in the vicinity of, or from a vehicle mounted unit is extremely restrictive due to the effects of magnetic fields on the DMC.  

Technical solution for improved capabilities:  A Non-Magnetic Azimuth Sensor solution is necessary to augment the DMC in existing laser rangefinders in all-weather environments and operate successfully in man portable or land mobile configurations regardless of magnetic variations. Optional capabilities may include system capability to cue the operator when calibration is required and automatic calibration compensation.

<SUBJECT>W--Lease of DS-3 Communication Line
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Electric Lightwave LLC, 180 S. Clinton Ave, Rochester, NY  14604-1803.  This purchase order is for the continued lease of a private line DS3 from 2600 N. Central Phoenix, AZ, handing off to Broadwing in the basement to Central Arizona Project (CAP) headquarters at 23636 N. 7th St., 1st Floor.  A DS3 circuit requires fiber optic technology and only Electric Lightwave has an optical fiber route to where Reclamation's CAP headquarters are located.  Although there are providers of communication services in the area, none have the optical infrastructure required to carry DS3 service.  DS3 service is critical in order to provide video surveillance and other services that require large amounts of bandwidth to CAP control facilities.  Because Electric Lightwave owns the fiber, it also owns the electronic facilities utilized to carry the DS3 service.

<SUBJECT>A -- Rituximab Therapy in Refractory Adult and Juvenile Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies
<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to carry out a study to assess the efficacy of intravenous Rituximab in a multi center 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of refractory myositis in adults and children.  The trial will be conducted among adult and pediatric rheumatologists and neurologists implementing the newly defined disease activity and damage measures (developed by the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Study Group (IMACS) in childhood and adult inflammatory myopathy.  The goal is to examine the efficacy of Rituximab as a potentially important new therapeutic advance for these diseases.  Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen that results in elimination of circulating B cells and is currently FDA-approved for use in B cell lymphomas. A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The University of Pittsburgh is determined to be the only responsible source for the following reasons: (1) They have organized the effort to conduct the study in full collaboration with the majority of myositis research centers in the U.S. and internationally; 2) They have obtained approval and collaboration of the drug manufacturer to conduct the study; 3) They were awarded and carried out a planning grant to organize the study and to develop and test the primary outcomes instrument in collaboration with the IMACS.  Therefore, the University of Pittsburgh has the unique capability to perform this work.  This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this work unfeasible.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS.

<SUBJECT>96 -- WAIVER OF NONMANUFACTURER RULE
<DESC>The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Aluminum, Sheet, Plate, and Foil Manufacturing.  The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program.  

This waiver is effective on June 24, 2004.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8(a) (17) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(A)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waiver the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market.  As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market on these classes of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.  The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems. The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.

The SBA received a request on April 16, 2004 to waiver the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Aluminum, Sheet, Plate, and Foil Manufacturing.  In response, on April 30, 2004, SBA published in the FEDBIZOPPS a notice of intent to grant the waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Aluminum, Sheet, Plate, and Foil Manufacturing.  SBA explained in the notice that it was soliciting comments and sources of small business manufacturers of this class of products.  In response to this notice, no comments were received from any interested party.  SBA has determined that there are no small business manufacturers of this class of products, and is therefore granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Aluminum, Sheet, Plate, and Foil Manufacturing, NAICS 331315.

AUTHORITY:  15 u.s.c. 637(a)(17).

<SUBJECT>R -- Risk Analysis and Assessments
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). It is not a solicitiation, not an anoouncement of a solicitation, and not a notice of intent to later issue a solicitation. Do not attempt to request or register to receive a solicitation at this time as that is not the purpose of this announcement. No vendor(s) will be selected for a contract award based on their response to this RFI, it is for market research and procurement planning purposes only. The Protective Security Division in the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security is requesting white information from organizations that have demonstrated capability in the area of risk analysis and assessments. Since there are multiple, diverse risk models and approaches for assessing risk, PSD would like to make an initial assessment of the utility of the various approaches to supporting DHS decisions through a review of white papers. This inquiry may or may not lead to procurement, depending on the results of the review and possible subsequent requests for proposals. 
Each approach will be evaluated by a team of DHS personnel and/or contract support  on the basis of the approach’s utility for supporting DHS policy and operational decisions, those of sector specific agencies, those of local authorities, and those of owners and operators. It is not expected that approaches will meet every need, but accurate, meaningful communication of risk factors among these partners will be an end result of our efforts, and the utility of each approach to meeting this need should be accentuated and defended.
We anticipate that each approach has a developmental history that can help us understand its utility and constraints. Please provide a brief history and how you have adapted it to consider the presenting problem of an intelligent, coordinated, non-state adversary.
Description of the Methodology:
The white papers should discuss the following topics as they apply to the field of counterterrorism:
•	How is risk defined?
•	How is risk measured?
•	What type of decisions was the analytic approach designed to inform? Examples of what is meant by types of decisions include:
o	Distribution of resources or costs.
o	Single authority assuming responsibility to enact best policy decisions.
o	Single authority assuming responsibility to enact best operational decisions.
•	Does the analytic approach incorporate scenarios?
o	How are scenarios determined?
o	How is the likelihood of any one scenario occurring determined? 
o	Does the methodology allow comparisons among tactics for a given target, targets for a given tactic?
•	What general knowledge and information about the threat does the methodology require?
•	What educational level and experience does the methodology require?
•	What are the measures of consequences used by the methodology and how are they determined?
•	How is the issue of the likelihood of the event handled?
•	How are the effects of countermeasures and mitigations considered?
•	How long does it take to complete an assessment?
•	How does the assessment update based in the implementation of new measures?
•	What is the durability of this assessment? (How frequently should it be redone, or does it allow rapid updating, and if so, how, and by whom?)
•	How does the methodology deal with uncertainties?
•	What do the inputs and outputs of your analytic approach represent? Examples of inputs:
o	Workman’s comp insurance data
o	Expert judgment on interdependencies
o	Decision authority’s qualitative assessment of value
o	Security personnel’s assessment of ________
Examples of outputs:
o	Hard figures related to consequences
o	Scaled “bins” of consequences
o	Scores that represent __________
Please indicate your capability of providing risk factors in disaggregated forms, i.e.:
•	What types of consequences can be reported? 
•	A measure of adversary intent (and its association with a tactic, a target, or the combination.),
•	A measure of  adversary capability, 
•	The effect of existing protective measures, 
•	The likelihood that adversaries could overcome the protective measures.
Example Problems as a Demonstration:
Describe hypothetically how the methodology would have worked in June of 2001 in order to assess the risk of the coordinated attack of 9/11 either as a single event, or within the range of alternative competing scenarios. (Please document your assumptions).
•	What intelligence/knowledge about the threat would have been required for the successful application of the approach?
•	What information about the US infrastructure, key assets, and critical functions would the successful application of the approach required? 
Using the same process, describe more briefly how the methodology would work in May 2004 in order to assess the risk of two other landmark skyscrapers (your selection) to a similar airborne scenario.
Constraints:
Please limit your description of the approach to 7 pages, and to 4 pages each for the 2 sample problems, or a total of 15 pages. Papers that exceed this limit by the inclusion of attached documentation about knowledge assumptions are welcome as well.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Announcement - Optically Designated Attack Munitions (ODAM)
<DESC>DARPA will host an ODAM Proposers Day Workshop on Monday, June 21, 2004 to promote discussion of the OPTICALLY DESIGNATED ATTACK MUNITIONS (ODAM) Program.  ODAM is a technology development and integration program to demonstrate a low cost optical seeker for converting a 60mm mortar into a precision guided munitions system.  These systems will improve U.S. effectiveness in providing small, operational units with cost- effective organic precision indirect fires capable of operating across the full gamut of environments including grassland, desert, arctic, and urban.  DARPA believes that the desired performance and cost characteristics can be achieved by the combination of innovative design and integration of ex-isting and developmental technologies, resulting in a guidance package fuze system that is "plug compatible" with existing munitions.

The goals of this meeting are threefold: 1) To familiarize participants with DARPA's interest in cutting edge mortar guidance technologies; 2) to identify potential offerors and promote understanding of the RFP; and 3) to promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.  Attendees are encouraged to explore strong teaming and business re-lationships, as applicable, in order to develop competitive responses to a forthcoming DARPA ODAM RFP, anticipated to be released in Final Form on or about 21 JUN 04.

Examples of technologies of interest include but are not limited to the following: LED alterna-tives to laser designators, uncooled phtotodetector technology (daytime and nighttime alterna-tives), design alternatives for compact optics, etc.  Only those designs meeting minimum stan-dards, as set forth in the Request For Proposal (RFP), will be considered.

<SUBJECT>A -- IRIA 1-Month Extension
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) plans to award a sole source modification for a one-month extension and one-month option to Veridan Systems Division, Inc. (Veridan) in support of the Infrared Information Analysis Center (IRIA) under contract SP0900-96-D-0080. Veridan is the only source to provide IRIA services within the required timeframe. This action represents a bridge extension until a competitive follow-on acquisition is awarded. Veridan has the operational capability in place for continuous DoD-wide demand for technical support in the area of Infrared Technology. Award to any other source would require transition and start-up time that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling ongoing critical agency requirements. This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be a request for competitive proposals. The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 © (1).

                        Statement of Work
               IT Certification & Accreditation 

1.0	INTRODUCTION

Federal law and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance includes the requirement that agencies establish oversight mechanisms, to evaluate systematically and ensure the continuing security, interoperability, and availability of systems and their data.  More specifically, the guidance requires a process, identified herein as Security Accreditation, to ensure that a management official authorizes in writing the use of each Major/Non-Major Application and General Support System (GSS) based on implementation of its security plan before beginning or significantly changing processing in the system. Use of the system shall be re-authorized at least every three years, or when a major change that impacts security of the system occurs.

Security accreditation is the official management decision to authorize operation of an information system.  Security accreditation, which is required under OMB Circular A-130, provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staff at all levels to implement the most effective security controls and techniques, given technical constraints, operational constraints, cost and schedule constraints, and 
mission requirements.

Security evaluation plays an important role in the security accreditation process. This evaluation, made in support of the security accreditation process, determines the effectiveness of these security controls in a particular environment of operation and the vulnerabilities in the information system after the implementation of such controls.  The results of the security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the security plan for the information system—thus, providing the factual basis for the authorizing official to render the security accreditation decision. 

1.1	OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain security consultation and technical support to develop specific documentation and perform tasks that meet USDA’s requirements for Certification & Accreditation (C&A) of two hundred and thirteen (213), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), applications and GSS.  These requirements consist of the tasks for Information Technology (IT) C&A activities as noted in this SOW.  (Referenced in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37).

1.2	USDA C&A GUIDE

The USDA Certification and Accreditation Guide is intended to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to the C&A process.  Individuals responsible for, or involved in the C&A process, will use this guide as a resource to assist them in certifying and accrediting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Major/Non-Major Applications and General Support Systems.

The USDA C&A Guide defines three distinct phases.  Pre-Certification, Certification, and Accreditation.  Security Certification and Accreditation for low impact systems can be demonstrated as stated in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199.  The scalability of the certification and accreditation process for low impact systems results in the elimination of the independent certification agent, the incorporation of self-assessment activities, and a reduction in the associated level of supporting documentation and paperwork as prescribed in NIST SP 800-37.

2.0 	SCOPE

This scope of work includes all of the following activities, each of which is described in the USDA C&A Guide and NIST SP 800-37.  These tasks and the products that result from them must meet the above referenced USDA/NIST specifications and guidelines.  

ARS is the principal in-house research agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  ARS currently has 100 research locations including a few in other countries.  The contractor shall provide security consultation and technical support to ARS to complete C&A activities for all of it’s Major/Non-Major Applications and General Support Systems, consisting of local area networks and web farms geographically located across the Unitied States at ARS Area Offices and field locations.  

The contractor shall develop detailed instructions, templates, and boilerplates to assist ARS system administrators to create documentation and complete tasks that meets USDA’s requirements for certification and accreditation.

3.0 	Tasks

3.1	Identify Required Security Controls

The contractor shall identify and document all security controls that shall be on Agency IT systems, including those specified in the System Security Plan and any additional requirements needed to secure the system at the proper security categorization.  The controls shall be compiled from USDA guidance, other federal guidance, including OMB A-130, NIST SP 800-53, FISMA, and industry best practices.  

The security controls shall include management, technical and operation controls for the system, in addition to environmental and physical security controls.  The contractor shall confirm that the security category of the information system has been determined and documented in the system security plan.  The controls shall match the system categorization as defined in FIPS Publication 199.

3.2 	Develop/Review Security Plans  

All USDA agencies and staff offices are required to develop individual Security Plans for all Agency IT systems.  USDA OCIO has developed instructions and templates for each type of plan. The contractor shall perform a review of the security plans to determine the validity of the plan.  Furthermore, the contractor shall review and recommend updates of agency security plans based on the results of the security plan review process.

The contractor shall recommend modifications and update agency system security plans as needed to meet NIST SP 800-18, FISMA, and Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit requirements.  Recommendations shall be incorporated into the plans, and modifications shall be made to ensure consistency between the security plan and self-assessment.

3.3	Perform Initial Risk Assessments

The contractor shall review Agency IT system self-assessments and confirm that the risk to agency operations, assets, or individuals has been determined and documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or an equivalent document.

The contractor shall apply a methodology that meets or exceeds the specification of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed INFOSEC Assessment Methodology (IAM), NIST SP 800-26, NIST SP 800-30, OMB A-130 Appendix III, and USDA’s self-assessment guides, as applicable.  For low impact systems, the appropriate methods and procedures necessary to conduct a self-assessment of the information security controls is sufficient in accordance with NIST SP 800-37.  

3.4	Security Test and Evaluations

The contractor shall review the system security plan, self-assessment, and Security Test & Evaluation (ST&E) results and determine if the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals is acceptable.  Findings shall be documented in the System Security Evaluation reports, and weaknesses shall be documented in the Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) reports. 

A variety of assessment methods and tools may be employed to determine if vulnerabilities exist.  These may include both internal and external examination and shall address both physical and cyber security.  Tests and reviews used may include, but are not limited to:

·	Vulnerability scans
·	Security Plan review
·	Self-assessment review 

3.5	Develop Interconnectivity Agreements

All USDA agencies and staff offices that have obtained approval from the USDA CIO to access the Internet through a non-USDA Internet Service Provider (ISP) shall have an Interconnectivity Support Agreement (ISA) established between the agency and the non-USDA ISP.  The Interconnectivity Support Agreement is a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that states the level of security anticipated, the level attained, when and how information affecting the security of either or both systems will be exchanged, etc.

The contractor shall develop Interconnectivity Support Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding that meet USDA’s requirements for certification and accreditation in accordance with NIST SP 800-47.

4.0	STATUS REPORTING

The contractor shall brief the Contracting Officer’s Technical Point of Contact (TPOC), through weekly one-hour meetings.  These briefings will detail the week’s accomplishments, review the goals for the coming week, and act as a forum for logistics and general strategy issues.

5.0	DELIVERABLES

All deliverables require at least two iterations - a draft and a final.  The contractor shall provide copies of the original draft document and one electronic copy, formatted in MS Word (diskette, CD-ROM or encrypted electronic mail) to the TPOC for each deliverable or interim deliverable.  

The contractor shall submit drafts to the TPOC for review and comment in accordance with the contractor’s proposed milestone/delivery schedule.  The TPOC will consolidate comments and return the commented draft document to the contractor in electronic and hard copy form.  ARS shall have five business days for review and submission of written comments to the contractor.  The contractor shall submit final versions to the TPOC within five business days of comments being received.

<DESC>This procurement requires the vendor to provide charter airlines This procurement requires the vendor to provide charter airlines service for the Artesia Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule. The Aircraft proposed must accommodate a minimum of 120 passengers, must meet the industry standard for commercial flights with the exception of beverage/snack service and be in compliance with all FAA inspections, regulations and safety requirements for a commercial airliner. Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area. The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations. The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times. The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carriers regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas: Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT. The airline must provide for check in service at the International Airport. The FLETC will provide a manifest to the airline each Friday no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT. If there is space available, then any government employee on official travel may provide proper identification and travel orders at the gate and the airline will allow that individual to travel. The FLETC in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration will provide security screening for all students departing from Roswell to the International Airport selected. The FLETC will also provide for the loading of baggage at the Roswell Airport on to the return flight, however this only relates to the placing of the bags from the secure area to the aircraft. The Airline will be responsible for securing all baggage within the hold and is responsible for all damage after it is placed inside the aircraft. The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights. Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry. The offeror?s proposal shall state the minimum safety and insurance requirements that are required by law and shall provide information that they meet these requirements. Failure to meet this requirement will exclude the offeror from consideration. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerers in descending order of importance: (1) the offerors ability to meet the requirements in the SOW; (2) the offerors strategy to meet scheduled arrival and departure times given the availability of aircraft, flightworthiness of aircraft, etc; (3) an evaluation of past performance; and (4) price. Technical and past performance, when combined, is of significantly higher importance than price in this evaluation. The evaluation criteria can be reviewed by contacting Art Welton at 505-746-5782 or emailing him at art.welton@dhs.gov. The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is HSFLR040023. The proposal shall include this number and include a narrative on technical factors 1, 2 and 3 and should provide enough detail so that the Government can evaluate technical performance. Regarding past performance, the proposal should include a minimum of two contacts, if available, for two different charter airline service contracts performed by the offeror.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR BLACK BODY SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to Modify the Requirement. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to June 11, 2004. Three Blackbody system per the following description. A three blackbody system for integration into an advanced atmospheric remote sensor to be implemented on a high-altitude aircraft platform with specifications as given in the attached table.  The table shows requirements for the hot blackbody (hbb) and ambient blackbody (abb).  The third device is also a "hot" blackbody to be used for spectral calibration by being placed in back of a gas cell, and would therefore not require stringent thermal control or ultra-high emissivity; it would only have to be of the same diameter as the others and need to be heated to a temperature maximum given for the hot BB.  The ABB will remain at ambient temperature, and its temperature will be read only. The HBB will be heated to up to 110K above ambient (maximum absolute temperature of 75C), and its temperature will be both controlled and read.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 11, 2004.

Project Title:  Africa Regional (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania): East Africa Transportation Definitional Mission

1		Scope of Work

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility studies or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative studies or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassies in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of each Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to Kenya and Tanzania to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassies (non-travel review will be included for a project in Uganda).  The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassies upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassies may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA has received requests for funding from the governments of Kenya and Tanzania for a number of feasibility studies in the port, airport, and rail sectors.  USTDA has also received several requests for funding from the East African Community (EAC) for regional projects.  The DM team will be expected to travel to Kenya and Tanzania to conduct a review of these projects.  Research for a separate barge project in Uganda will be carried out without the need for travel to Uganda.  

As part of the overall strategic efforts to expand and modernize their economies, member countries of the East African Community are individually and, in some cases jointly, putting emphasis on developing transport infrastructure to expand their trade capacities.  At the same time, USTDA has expanded its presence in these countries to support USG policy priorities in transportation security, aviation safety, and increased AGOA trade. The proposed definitional mission consolidates USTDA efforts to evaluate the more substantive leads received and identified in recent trips to the East Africa region.  

In Kenya, the DM team will scope various projects where USTDA could play a role in the transportation sector with an emphasis on port and rail projects.  It is expected that transportation security and expansion will be a foci of the team’s review of the Port of Mombasa.  The team will also follow priorities outlined by Kenya’s Ministry of Transportation and Communications through USTDA meetings with the Minister and a recent report outlining the Ministry’s priorities,  “Recommendations on Integrated National Transport Policy”.  The Minister’s report will be made available to the DM consultant team as background for the mission.  Potential projects include the construction of a new commercial port in Lamu, and establishing more intermodal linkages between airports, ports, and rail transport.  The team will also explore the Minister’s request for USTDA grant funding for a major regional rail project, a drivers’ education training center, and the consideration of changing its narrow gauge rail system to regular gauge.  Other areas of focus will be on transportation safety and customs facilitation, the latter working with the U.S. Regional ECA Hub and the Kenya Revenue Authority.  

Regionally, the DM team will be asked to investigate key corridor and Lake Victoria projects prioritized by the East African Community (EAC) Secretariat.  These projects will be assessed on the likelihood that they will attract implementation funding given the EAC’s inability to provide sovereign guarantees.  USTDA believes that there is strong project potential in its early but successful partnership with the EAC.  

In Tanzania, the DM team will seek to prioritize projects proposed by the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority, the Tanzania Airports Authority, and Ministry of Communications and Transport.  The team will also seek out other transportation opportunities.  For example, Tanzania has requested help to revitalize and expand their railroads to attract bidders when they proceed to privatize the national system.  The team may also consider infrastructure and security projects at the Ports of Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam. 

In Uganda, USTDA expects to receive a proposal for a barge transport project on Lake Victoria.  The DM team will be expected to review this project and proposal for a potential funding recommendation.  This review will not involve travel to Uganda.
