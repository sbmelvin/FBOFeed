<p>Anticipated workload consists of providing all labor, equipment, and installation of all 1206 sq ft of anti-fatigue flooring to the pharmacy consisting of 3'x 3' reconfigurable modular molded pads that are one inch thick. As well as coating the flooring with polyurethane coating to prevent fluid penetration. The vendor will also provide 30 linear feet of 3.5" ramp and install where you enter and exit the anti-fatigue areas in the pharmacy to prevent safety issues. This requirement is anticipated to receive quotes from at least two small businesses, therefore it will be set-aside 100% for small business. The NAICS code for this requirement is 326299, all other rubber product manufacturing. The Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates issuing a Request for Quote with a 100% small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Request for Quote (RFQ) will be evaluated using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation factors. The Government shall issue an award to a single small business using a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), contract on or about 21 April 2011 with completed delivery and install NLT 30 ADC. We anticipate posting the solicitation 5 days after posting of this notice. This requirement shall be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages and the Statement of Work, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 28 March 2011 for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quote being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

<p>Response to this announcement is not required. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer, Capt. Krauss email: rosa.krauss@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain GIS Units as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.phpIn addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Sole Source Fixed Price contract to Rockwell Collins, Inc., of 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498-0001, for Full Rate Production (FRP) of the Block I Modification to the E-6B aircraft, pursuant to the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Under the proposed contract, Rockwell will install the Block I Modification on eleven (11) E-6B Aircraft, perform associated Training System Modifications and provide Logistics Support. The Block I Modification is required to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in Q3 FY13. Rockwell Collins is currently producing and installing E-6B Block I systems during Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) awarded sole source under NAVAIR contract N00019-10-C-0067, and has been the sole developer since a competitive Block I System Design &amp; Development (SDD) contract was awarded in 2004. Rockwell Collins is the only company with the unique tooling, knowledge, experience, and technical/configuration data acquired through the SDD and LRIP contracts to produce the modification kits and perform integration. Award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling requirements and result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. A Solicitation is not available at this time. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency. Inquiries concerning this synopsis should be submitted IN WRITING via electronic mail to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Meghan E.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 
 
Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division plans to enter into a three-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with General Dynamics Advance Information Systems (GD-AIS), 12450 Fair Lake Circle, Fairfax, VA 22033.
  It is anticipated that cost-plus-fixed fee job orders will be issued as required for a continuation of systems engineering support and system upgrades that was developed by GD-AIS as part of the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program.   In accordance with the statement of work, tasks will include software/firmware development, hardware system modifications, existing system modifications, upgraded/enhanced systems requirements, testing support, test utilities, scheduled lock installations and training aid developments/upgrades for instructor and student materials, attendance of miscellaneous meetings, preparations of various management studies and reports, as well as the provision of data deliverables.
  Tasks will also include updating existing manuals, operating software, software source codes and technical data for the on-going support of Blocks 1A, 1B1, 1B2 and 1B3.  Terms and conditions will be negotiated on a job order basis.

Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition includes the fact that GD-AIS is the original developer of the system and they possess the technical knowledge to continue the required support within ship schedules.  Additionally, significant duplication of cost would result if the BOA is awarded to any other contractor than GD-AIS and there is no funding available to develop a second source.
  

A formal solicitation will not be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested entities may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Direct questions to Ms. Diane L. Pearson by e-mail diane.pearson@navy.mil (preferred) or by phone 812-854-5201.  Please reference the last four digits of the solicitation number when responding to this notice.

The contractor shall retain title to the UASs (to include the aircraft and all equipment) at all times.  The UASs (to include the aircraft and all equipment) shall be under the control of contractor personnel at all times.

It is anticipated that an award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror.

It is anticipated that award will be made around 19 May 2011.  The solicitation will be made available electronically, upon its release, at www.neco.navy.mil.  Posting is anticipated on or about 6 April 2011, with the closing date for the receipt of offers to be set forth in the solicitation.  A hard copy of the solicitation will not be made available.  Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above mentioned website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments thereto.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1) Type of Notification: Sources Sought (FBO)
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis only, (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5). The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall include the following: (a) company name or individual physician name (b) address, (c) point of contact, (d) "number of employees" as defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 19.101 and (e) the amount of "annual receipts" as defined by the FAR part 19.</p>
<p>In addition, the respondent must provide a capability statement that addresses the organization's qualifications and ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.</p>
<p>2) Description: Personal Services (Neuro-Ophthalmologist)</p>
<p>The following is a brief summary of the primary duties that the Neuro-Ophthalmologist must perform:</p>
<p>Evaluating all patient refered with Neurophthalmologic diseases and disorders. This will include one day per week of Neurophthalmology clinic (including performance of Neurophthalmologic, pediatric and strabismus, and general ophthalmologic surgical procedures as needed). The Health Care Provider shall provide direct resident education during the Neurophthalmology teaching month based upon the resident education schedule. This statement is a projected need for Wilford Hall Medical Center and is subject to change in future postings for this requirement.</p>
<p>3) Hours of Performance:</p>
<p>To Be Determined, Please take notice that this may not be a full time position. At this time we are waiting for confirmation that this requitement will be supported.</p>
<p>4) Qualifications:</p>
<p>Neuro-Ophthalmologist is a physician who has completed a residency either in neurology or ophthalmology, followed by 1-2 years of fellowship training in Neuro-Ophthalmology. They deal with diseases of the optic nerves, cranial nerves 3,4,5 and 6; pupillary abnormalities, eye movement abnormalities and nystagmus, disorders of visual processing centers in the brain and visual problems in patients with certain neurological diseases. The assessments are usually longer than a typical ophthalmological exam as they do both an eye exam AND a neurological exam; so they see far fewer patients than a general ophthalmologist. The typical Neuro-Ophthalmologist case is a patient who has already seen 1-2 Ophthalmologist and neurologists, with no diagnosis.</p>
<p>5) Place of Performance:</p>
<p>These services would be performed at Wilford Hall Medical Center and/or military installations in San Antonio, TX.</p>

<DESC><strong>Solicitation Number: <br />BASH<br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought <br />Synopsis: <br />SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.</strong> This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.
<p>The AFNWC/PKOA, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking potential sources to provide service capabilities for BASH (Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard).</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE<br /></strong>Includes: The United States Air Force (USAF) experiences thousands of bird strikes each year during flight operations in low-altitude environments. To assist in reducing the potential of a damaging bird strike, the USAF Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Team developed a Bird Avoidance Model (BAM). The BAM has undergone several revisions in an effort to more adequately identify hazardous bird concentrations, but continues to be limited by biases in historical data.<br />NEXRAD data was made available to commercial vendors for processing to sell to various industries, mostly television markets. This National Information Distribution System (NIDS) allows for easy access to information from the Next Generation Weather Radar (WSR-88D) facilities nationwide at a single location by means of satellite data links. Advances in PC platforms allow for relatively inexpensive hardware to further process the data for development of a bird hazard advisory system. Finally, improvements in communications capabilities via fax and internet allow for distribution of hazard advisories to multiple locations in relatively short periods of time.</p>
<p>Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) advisories and forecasts are developed by processing radar data from the network of WSR-88D radars across the nation and from Marine Observation Satellite System (MOSS) weather data and vertical wind profiles. Data from the BAM is also incorporated into AHAS as a baseline model. Advisories and data processed through AHAS are archived for future integration into the BAM. Data collected from the AHAS system provides higher resolution for the development of future updates to the BAM. The more accurate data allows for the BAM to be a more integral part of the advisory system. <br />In FY2005, independent contractors researched and developed a real time bird monitoring radar using existing radar technologies to identify local bird hazards at airfields. This new system is Bird Detection Radar (BDR). HQ AFSC needs to develop the BDR for integration into future bird hazard warnings systems.<br />The contractor shall provide support services, including management, travel, and materials as required for the operation of the BAM, AHAS, and BDR functions of the BASH Program as well as assist the Air Force in the development, implementation, operational deployment, assessment, sustainment, and evolution of Air Force BASH programs; technology assessments; knowledge sharing of technological and operational findings, benefits, and advances; collaboration with BASH Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) and members of Sister Services on program goals and capabilities for Joint Programs; and publication and dissemination of educational materials, training materials, and lessons learned. Regular communication between the contractor, Air Force, and DoD personnel is required for optimal program development.<br />The overall focus of this requirement area involves analyses, review, and presentation of bird hazards in the flight environment; development of technical strategy recommendations; review and assessment of program/project technical direction/strategy; and technical consulting to programs and services. In particular it involves the following areas: analytical services, acquire radar and weather data, maintain and operate the BAM and AHAS, validate radar risk prediction, maintain system documentation, back up and archive data and providing technical assistance.<br />Qualifications<br />Please provide a list of licenses or certifications you feel may assist or provide support to your capabilities package.</p>
<p><strong>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ).</strong>Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business or large business. For consideration as a small business, the following applies: NAICS Code 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services), Size Standard $7.0 Million. Companies shall provide a capabilities statement no longer than 5 pages in length. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.</p>
<p>All&nbsp;companies interested&nbsp;in submitting a capabilities statement&nbsp;shall submit them no later than Monday, 28 March 2010 at 2:00 PM MST (Mountain Standard Time). Interested offers may be E-mailed (preferred) to michelle.allamon@kirtland.af.mil or mailed to AFNWC/PKOA, ATTN: Michelle Allamon, 2000 Wyoming Blvd SE, Bldg. 20604, Room B-18, Kirtland AFB NM 87117, or faxed to (505) 846-4262 ATTN: Michelle Allamon.</p>

<CONTACT>Kim Tangler, Subcontract Administrator II, Phone 303-384-7018, Fax 303-384-6950, Email kim.tangler@nrel.gov
<DESC>Background
<p>NREL's National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) is the primary Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory engaged in the research and testing of wind energy technology systems and components. The NWTC periodically needs to augment engineering and testing support capability via outside technical services to handle specialized needs or to ramp-up during periods of increased activity.</p>
<p>Engineering support may be required for (but not limited to) implementing innovative designs for test equipment such as blade test systems, upgrading major test capabilities such as the new 5MW dynamometer or analyzing the performance of existing wind power systems. Such engineering support consists of component sizing, material selection, parametric modeling (CAD/CAM), stress analysis (FEA, etc.) and the creation of working drawings and specification packages for fabrication or purchase. Support may be required to engineer the electrical and computer control functions of wind related systems.</p>
<p>Additionally, technical support of wind energy testing is required. The technical support services needed to evaluate and test wind energy systems and components span a wide range of wind turbine sizes from small stand-alone sub-kilowatt turbines to large multi-megawatt machines which are interconnected to the utility grid. The majority of laboratory and field testing activities at the NWTC are conducted in the Dynamometer Test Facility, the Structural Test Facility, and at the various field testing sites located on the NWTC campus.</p>
<p>A2LA-accredited field testing done on full-scale turbines in-situ requires following IEC guidelines to test power performance, noise emissions, structural loads, and power quality (see References 1-4). A2LA accredited tests of wind energy components include dynamometer testing of drive train subsystems (gearbox and power electronics converter) and IEC structural tests of wind turbine blade components (see Reference 5). The quality of products and technical services delivered by the Subcontractor is dependent on reliable measurements. Support personnel must follow A2LA policy for measurement traceability of experimental data (see Reference 7).</p>
<p>NREL places a high value on employee safety and safe working environments. Safety is the first priority for all work conducted at the NWTC and workers on the site, both engineering and technical, are expected to be trained in safety and other work procedures and to follow all safety and work procedures at all times.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>1. Provide engineering expertise to develop wind energy and wind energy related test systems.</p>
<p>2. Assist NREL in conducting laboratory and field tests of wind energy systems and components according to IEC protocols and NREL A2LA accreditation policy (or other accreditation and certification systems in effect at the time of testing). Support the instrumentation, installation, and field testing of other wind turbine systems and components which are managed outside the accreditation system.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statements should demonstrate familiarity with the following standards and policies.</p>
<p>References: <br />1. Wind Turbine Generator Systems - Part 12: Wind Turbine Power Performance Testing, IEC 61400 -12 <br />2. Wind Turbine Generators Systems - Part 11: Acoustic Noise Measurement Techniques, IEC 61400 - 11 <br />3. Wind Turbine Generator Systems - Part 13: Measurement of Mechanical Loads, IEC TS 61400 - 13<br />4.

<p>a) Design, develop and customize a searchable database to contain the needed information about the specimens (the Specimen database). This database shall contain information concerning the collection inventory, including demographic, pathologic, and clinical outcome data on the cases. This task shall be done in close consultation with the COTR. The Government estimates ten sets of data, each one containing data on five hundred to one thousand different cases, will be assembled over the course of the contract. It is projected that 3-5 sets will be assembled in the first two years of the contract.</p>
<p>b) Assist the NCI and contributing institutions, as requested by the COTR, in the development of data structures to allow collection of data electronically.</p>
<p>c) Receive completed electronic data, edit and screen for errors, correct errors per discussions with COTR and the NCI statistician and enter and store data into the database. These data shall be updated semi-annually or as requested by the COTR.</p>
<p>d) Develop appropriate data entry quality control programs in consultation with the COTR. These activities shall include routine edit checks to ensure the quality of the data, removal of duplicate data, internal checks to compare data among related databases to ensure that they are consistent, periodic reports to the NCI statisticians of subsets of data by site and reports and summaries of database problems.</p>
<p>e) Establish a system to receive and respond to NCI's inquiries about the availability of specimens. Work with the COTR and CDP statisticians to identify appropriate specimens to fill requests, and run routine statistical reports. The system shall rely on the database established by the Contractor.</p>
<p>f) Generate reports based on the information contained in the database as requested by the COTR. Prepare statistical reports required by Cancer Diagnosis Program statistician(s) as directed by the COTR using available statistical software and any routine modifications necessary to prepare the requested reports. The preparation of reports shall occasionally require high level programming support, including but not limited to coding computer simulations, writing routines to perform statistical tests which are not currently available as standard routines in statistical packages, and creating complex graphical displays of raw data or statistical analysis results. When requested to by the COTR, the Contractor shall be required to prepare these reports with very short deadlines, meaning deadlines that would require redirection of contractor resources (time and staff) to meet. All statistical support services provided by the Contractor shall be conducted under the guidance of Cancer Diagnosis Program statisticians.</p>
<p>In support of the efforts under Task 6, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>a) Design, develop and maintain databases of laboratory data (the Laboratory databases) from NCI-generated studies of assay performance characteristics. These databases shall be developed under the guidance of the COTR and other involved personnel because the specific data generated will differ depending on the study. These databases could be in a simple format such as Excel or tab-delimited text files. The government estimates 2-3 studies in the first contract year, to increase in subsequent contract years depending on demand. Contractor shall consult with the COTR, study investigators, NCI program staff and statisticians to effectively manage data. This includes frequent phone calls and e-mails and participation in conference calls and attendance at resource and research network meetings.</p>
<p>b) Design, develop and maintain databases of projects (the Project Tracking databases) from NCI-generated studies of assay performance characteristics. These databases shall be developed under the guidance of the COTR. These databases shall be capable of tracking all projects from the point of first consideration, through project performance to exit from the program. The government estimates 2-3 studies in the first contract year, to increase in subsequent contract years depending on demand and available NCI resources. Contractor shall consult with the COTR and NCI program staff to effectively manage data.</p>
<p>c) Provide data management support for research projects initiated by the Cancer Diagnosis Program, involving receipt of data and entry into a database. For example, these data may include molecular analysis data from different technical platforms and clinical annotation of the specimens analyzed. This shall also include programming to customize appropriate databases. It is anticipated that there will be 1-2 projects per year.</p>
<p>d) Assist the NCI and extramural investigators, as requested by the COTR, in the development of experimental and clinical data forms to allow collection of archival/existing data in a computer-ready format. As requested by the COTR, the Contractor shall duplicate and ship forms to the investigators with written instructions for completion of the forms, receive completed data forms or electronic data, edit and screen for errors, correct errors per discussions with COTR and NCI statistician(s) and enter data into the database. This includes development of appropriate data-entry quality-control programs in consultation with the COTR. These activities must include routine edit-checks to ensure the quality of the data, removal of duplicate data, internal checks to compare data among related databases to ensure that they are consistent, periodic reports to the NCI statisticians of subsets of data and reports and summaries of database problems.</p>
<p>e) Prepare statistical reports required by Cancer Diagnosis Program statistician(s) as requested by the COTR using available statistical software and any modifications necessary to prepare the requested reports. The preparation of reports shall occasionally require high level programming support, including but not limited to coding computer simulations, writing routines to perform statistical tests which are not currently available as standard routines in statistical packages, and creating complex graphical displays of raw data or statistical analysis results. When requested to by the COTR, the contractor shall be required to prepare these reports with very short deadlines, meaning deadlines that would require redirection of contractor resources (time and staff) to meet All statistical support services provided by the contractor shall be conducted under the guidance of Cancer Diagnosis Program statisticians.</p>
<p>f) Provide coded data sets in computer-readable storage medium in the format as directed by the COTR.</p>
<p>g) Establish and maintain secure document- and data-sharing websites for use by various working groups as requested by the COTR. The Government estimates that 10-20 such sites are needed over the course of the contract. <br />Information Submission Instructions:</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)
<p><br />BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The aviator ready room chair currently placed onboard US Navy Aircraft Carriers is a specially designed seat that meets the unique requirements and functions of aviation personnel conducting operations aboard aircraft carriers. The legacy version of this chair met the needs of aviators at the time of its design, however the design and functionality of an updated ready room chair must accommodate the frequent use of laptop computers, provide an ergonomic and comfortable design for the seated aviator dressed in full flight gear ensemble, and be constructed of high-strength, lighter weight materials to accommodate the reconfiguration of ready room seating to support varying space functions and to minimize the effort and time necessary to maintain the deck.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL DISCUSSION:</p>
<p>The goal of this RFI is to explore the technical aspects of the components of this requirement. The Government is seeking industry input to assist in identifying features and approaches to meet the general requirements described below. Please note that the Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p><br />Current Configuration</p>
<p>The legacy aviator ready room chair can be referenced by Hull Type Drawing Number: 805-1646563, https://90machinery.navsses.navy.mil/habitability/furniture/productDetail.asp?prodId=108</p>
<p><br />Desired information</p>
<p>If the exisiting chair were replaced, an ideal solution would be with a commerical item already developed. Alternatively companies may identify themselves as interested in meeting this potential requirement. If a commercial item is recommended, please provide a complete description of the chair and address the following quesitons. <br />&bull; What techniques may be implemented in the design and construction of a replacement chair to ensure long-term comfort to users?<br />&bull; What techniques have been implemented in the design and construction of this chair to minimize the weight and physical footprint of the chair while maintaining stability of the chair during high sea states? Is there a method to attach each chair to the ship's deck (assume the deck is configured for flexible infrastructure)?<br />&bull; The design and construction of this chair should allow the occupant to use a laptop computer on the working surface? What are the working surface dimensions and method to extend/ stow the working surface?<br />&bull; Does the design and construction of this chair incorporate a storage compartment?

<SUBJECT>COTS software solution for data replication 
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-11-0322

<ARCHDATE>04062011
<CONTACT>Rick Bolt, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-966-8765, Email rick.bolt@ssa.gov
<DESC>Request for Information
<p>This request for information (RFI) announcement is for information and planning purposes only; vendors should not construe it as a commitment by the Government. The Government may or may not award a contract based upon responses to this RFI. The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) software solution for data replication that will operate on IBM iSeries Systems at multiple locations.</p>
<p>SSA's IT Operations Assurance (ITOA) project provides for the protection of the critical Information Technology (IT) infrastructure assets of the Agency. The protection of these critical infrastructure assets, including hardware, software, telecommunications, building and physical plant and personnel, is required under Homeland Security Presidential Declaration 7, Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization and Protection, dated December 17, 2003.<br /><br />The ITOA project has mitigated the internally identified risks associated with single points of failure at the National Computer Center (NCC) located in Baltimore, Maryland by establishing a second, fully functional, co-processing data center, the Second Support Center (SSC) located in Durham, North Carolina. Each center currently processes a portion of SSA's critical and non-critical workloads. Upon completion in 2012, each center will back up the data assets of the other. SSA designed the centers so that in the event of a disaster, one center can assume the critical workloads of the other center. <br /><br />Recognizing that establishment of a second computing facility is a major investment of time and resources; SSA has identified critical stages of development (and resulting risk mitigation) for this project. SSA is currently implementing a disaster recovery strategy between the NCC and the SSC that will employ remote mirroring of data between the NCC and SSC. This effort will ensure that in the event of a disaster, the amount of data loss will be less than 1 hour (recovery point objective or RPO), and the recovery time (recovery time objective or RTO) will be 24 hours or less.</p>
<p>A key portion of SSA's IT infrastructure assets consist of IBM iSeries Systems, which provide the bulk of the business processing for the Disability Determination Services (DDS). SSA seeks a COTS solution to replicate data between the NCC and SSC iSeries.</p>
<p><br />SSA has identified mandatory requirements for the COTS for this implementation. The vendor must demonstrate that the software solution has been implemented as a disaster recovery solution for organizations that have a similar size and scope to the SSA IBM iSeries implementation to include:</p>
<p>&bull; All interested parties must provide a COTS solution that will support data replication between systems at a distance greater than 300 miles.</p>
<p>&bull; The sites consist of two(2) IBM Power 570 systems, Type 9117 Model MMA, using System i operating systems. The operating level of the systems is IBM i OS V6R1. The proposed solution must be able to run on that platform and be upgradable to future operating system releases.</p>
<p>&bull; The primary complex consists of five (5) logical partitions with six (6) processing units currently activated. Due to possible expansion of the workload, all interested parties should be able to support a minimum of eight processing units. The system has 192 Gigabytes of memory. The internal DASD is composed of IBM Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) DASD technology. The disks are a combination of IBM Type 433C, Model 050 and 433C Model 099. The active partitions are using four(4) Terabytes of storage. The proposed solution must be able to run within this DASD environment and not require external DASD.</p>
<p>&bull; Two (2) of the current partitions are using mirrored DASD protection, two (2) are under RAID5 parity, and the fifth is a disaster recovery partition that can use either technology.</p>
<p>&bull; The Capacity Backup Unit (CBU) system consists of 32 activated processors, 128 Gigabytes of memory and 15.4 Terabytes of mirrored internal DASD.</p>
<p>&bull; Communication between sites is supported by a 10-Gigabit interface.</p>
<p>&bull; Data replication should be able to support all System i file structures (e.g. the System i library file structure, the Integrated File System (IFS), and the Open Systems Structure).</p>
<p>&bull; Interested parties should demonstrate a controlling feature within their product. This will provide SSA with the ability to monitor and modify the performance of their system functionality.</p>
<p>&bull; The COTS system will allow SSA to perform temporary switches to the CBU facility to validate fallback capabilities. These exercises should occur without harming the data on either complex or require an extended set up period to prepare for the test.</p>
<p>&bull; Exercises on the secondary system should not affect the workload on the primary complex. The system should be able to store any modification to the primary complex. At the completion of these exercises, the COTS solution will apply all transactions that occurred on the primary complex, to the secondary complex until both complexes have returned to an in-sync condition.</p>
<p><br />&bull; The system must perform within the guidelines prescribed by the ITOA project (RTO of 24 hours or less and RPO of 1 hour or less) for an actual fallback.</p>
<p>&bull; Additionally, the vendor should demonstrate past performance and relevant experience in IBM iSeries Disaster Recovery contracts that include:</p>
<p>o Providing two(2) site and multi-site configurations</p>
<p>o Providing operating system platform analysis</p>
<p>o Providing pilot strategy</p>
<p>o Providing configuration of test and production environment including site connectivity</p>
<p>o Providing plans for site-to-site connectivity</p>
<p>o Providing problem reporting process changes/updates</p>
<p>o Providing capacity and performance analysis</p>
<p>o Providing I/O analysis of production environment</p>
<p>o Providing change control processes</p>
<p>o Providing installation and customization of automation routines</p>
<p>o Providing implementation of data replication</p>
<p>o Providing management of data replication product</p>
<p><br />Any firm that feels they have the COTS solution that meets the requirements listed above must respond, in writing, via e-mail to the Contract Specialist by the response due date posted. Vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal. NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. Requests for copies of a solicitation at this time will not be acknowledged.</p>
<p>The Government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in reply to this notice. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used in SSA's market research efforts and for procurement planning purposes. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted in an electronic format (compatible with MS Office 2007) via e-mail to the Contract Specialist by the due date specified. Faxed information will not be considered. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is five (5) Megabytes. Electronic responses must be received by 5:00PM ET April 5, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Department of State is conducting market research to determine the degree of interest and capability of <strong>small businesses only</strong> in providing a commercially available proprietary tool or application database that is able to support data from multiple global and regional vendors. The database has to be able to accommodate data for 55,000 plus employees in over 173 countries. This database will assist the Office of Overseas Employment (OE) with the Human Resources Bureau (HR) of the Department of State (DoS) for establishing and updating local pay and benefit plans that apply to all local hires of the U.S. Government within non-US countries where DoS has a presence.<br /><br />The purpose of this database is to enable DoS to conduct market analysis and job pricing by importing data from multiple vendors into a single database; analyzing the data from multiple sources to provide DoS the basis for recommending and making revisions to local compensation plans consistent with the requirements of the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH); comparing the off-the-shelf compensation data to the compensation level of key survey jobs most frequently found in local labor markets; and, providing reports to post management in order to maximize transparency and maintain credibility in the system. The vendor may be required to conduct training to Department personnel regarding the use of this database and upgrades to the database. <br /><br />The NAICS code for this service is 541612. Responses from all vendors must clearly demonstrate capabilities through examples of previous and/or current database contracts or experience closely related hereto.<br /><br />In addition, the vendor must be able to demonstrate their proprietary tool or application database can perform at least the following and they must specifically address each of the capabilities listed.<br /><br />1. The proprietary tool or application database can support an unlimited number of off the shelf compensation surveys from multiple international and regional vendors;<br />2. The database would allow for the input or import of an unlimited number of DoS salary schedules with a 13 grade structure, up to 25 steps, including bonuses and allowances;<br />3. Components of employee pay that includes base pay, bonuses, allowances, and total pay;<br />4. Identify workweek hours, regional pay differentials, "as of" date, and number of incumbents;<br />5. Allow for analysis of and conversion to local currently and U.S. Dollar by allowing for input of specific exchange rate;<br />6. Allow users to modify all or part of the salary structure by across the board or varied percentages, or fixed amounts to the midpoint as well as the minimum rate;<br />7. Provide for calculation of within grade increases and rate ranges;<br />8. Support a traditional salary structure (minimum/maximum) as well as pay bands;<br />9. Allow codes to be used to protect the confidentiality of individual compensation data;<br />10. Store data on a country by country and job by job basis for three to five years;<br />11. List of survey jobs and a detailed description of each survey job used by the vendor to obtain compensation data;<br />12. Data reported for each surveyed job includes job title, level if one of several levels for one type of job, the number of incumbents among the surveyed companies and/or the number of companies having a match to each survey job; and<br />13. Vendor maintains a job match quality control program in place across countries to ensure jobs matched have the same levels of duties, responsibilities and complexity (a job match is an employer's job with one or more incumbents whose duties and responsibilities are similar to one of DoS's benchmark job).<br /><br />It is requested that all interested small business parties submit their capabilities by e-mail addressing all of the above requirements by 5:00 p.m. EST, March 31, 2011 (your response is limited to a total of seven pages). If you have any questions or comments, you may contact Deborah Carey at (703)875-4229 or by e-mail to careyda@state.gov, please reference this Sources Sought notice (1025150024) when calling or e-mailing.<br /><br />At this time, the U.S. Department of State does not guarantee that any future contracts may be awarded covering the aforementioned criteria and responses to this Sources Sought notice do not bind the U.S. Department of State to any agreement with the responder, be it explicit or implied.

<DESC>The Administrative Operations Service (AOS) is responsible for maintaining and overseeing the production of the Commissioned Corps officer's payroll using the Commissioned Corps Personnel and Payroll system (CCP). Commissioned Corps Systems Branch (CCSB), an organization within AOS, transmits all Commissioned Corps Payroll to the Department of Treasury after each monthly payroll is computed, validated and certified.
<p>Direct Access (DA). Direct Access is currently the System of Record for Licenses and Certifications, Readiness compliance and officer HR data not tied to pay and benefits. It is maintained for the benefit of the Corps by the United States Coast Guard. The OASH, Coast Guard and OMB are committed to migrating positions, the recruitment system, the applicant system, the electronic call to active duty system, the promotion system, and the officer evaluation system to Direct Access over the next 5years. This will necessitate ongoing changes to the pay and personnel system to accommodate these Direct Access implementations.</p>
<p>Commissioned Corps Personnel and Payroll System (CCP). CCP is the web-based, real-time, workflow enabled, personnel and payroll management system providing electronic initiation and processing of military personnel actions, computing compensation and maintaining personnel and payroll records for Active Duty and Retired Officers of the Commissioned Corps. The CCP system provides a full range of services from call to duty through retirement.</p>
<p>Commissioned Corps Compensation Branch (CB). CB collects records, maintains files, audits individual payees, performs payroll transactions using CCP and administers a system of basic pay, allowances, and special or incentive pay for active duty Corps. CB also administers a pay system for retired officers and survivor annuitants. The Branch provides these services in coordination with the Departments of Defense (DOD), Veterans Affairs, and Treasury.</p>
<p>Office of Commissioned Corps Operations (OCCO). The Office of Commissioned Corps Operations collects records, maintains files, and performs personnel related transactions using CCP.</p>
<p>In general, it is expected the Contractor shall provide pay and personnel maintenance services that supports the active duty and retired Corps Officers. The pay and personnel maintenance services must be able to handle the collection of source documents, determination of all pay categories, gross-to-net calculations, and interface with all the various internal and external systems required to ensure the accurate disbursement of funds, meet all reporting needs and maintenance of all related IT systems. Once successfully implemented, the system needs to be kept current: both for routine pay table adjustments and for changes to pay calculations as mandated by the Secretary of HHS or Congress. The vendor is expected to draw on their established methods, best business practices, and Government/industry experience.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of  FAR 13.501 with Alliant Healthcare, 8850 M-89 Richland, MI 48093 as the only responsible source that can provide a Stryker 940 Cast Cutter.  

USNS Comfort has a need for ten (10) surgical cast cutters used for the removal of therapeutic casting using blades made of stainless steel or any other non corrosive, rust-resistant metal on patients who have suffered broken or sprained bones or ligaments due to trauma. The unit is used for the creation of hinged casts, or to open a window in the cast to view and evaluate underlying tissue. The cast cutters shall be hand-held and allow the user to quickly connect to a compatible vacuum system for safe and clean use.
 They shall operate at a standard speed and a high speed for quick removal of thicker body jackets and hip spica casts. The unit shall have a traditional ergonomic design for comfort and control while cutting as well as an impact and shock resistant plastic or composite housing. This cast cutter shall be powered by a 120VAC/60 HZ power source and comply with all shipboard electrical safety regulations.

The Stryker 940 Cast Cutter is a hand held cast cutting instrument intended for surgical environments and is used by healthcare providers in their diagnoses of the status of the underlying tissues.
 After several weeks of wearing a plaster cast, quick removal of the material from the patients tissue is required. The Stryker 940 has a standard speed and a high speed for thicker plaster removal. A powder residue is expelled from the cast during removal which can be a health and safety hazard to the operator and the patient. The Stryker 940 is the only cast cutter on the market that can connect to the 986 CastVac which is the existing vacuum removal system onboard used to alleviate the problem of the powder residue. Shipboard space constraints call for the need of a small hand held portable unit for safe, quick, and efficient cast cutting. The Stryker 940 cast cutter is a light hand-held unit that is readily compatible the existing shipboard electrical safety regulations and will require no further staff training for use.
    

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures FAR 13.501 under the authority of the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996). There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North America industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.
  All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.


Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Jaime Belletto, jaime.belletto@med.navy.mil  by 4 PM EST on 31 March 2011.  No phone calls accepted.

The purpose of this data base is to allow 250 Contracting Officers in 14 locations to compose, archive, retrieve and manage contract file documents. <br>- Document storage, archival, and back up services. A contract file is a collection of associated documents. The government organization anticipating using the above website generates approximatley 30,000 contract files annually and each file averages 30 plain-text documents. The file-management data base hosted would require access to all archived documents and appropriate back-up services.<br>- Data base maintenance. This organization's created, but not operating at full capacity, data base is written in Sequel Server with MS Silverlight HTML interface. The single source vendor should be able to provide data base maintenance and add additional features to the data base as needed.<br>- Data base design. In addition to the above already-created data base, this organization has need of at least one more large data base to be designed from scratch and deployed. The engaged organization would be able to design, develop and deploy a second data base from concepts and non-technical designs provided by non-computer professionals.<br>- Data base consulting. Our organization has an ongoing need for professional data base consulting to maintain and upgrade existing Sequel/Silverlight data bases, which would be billed on an hourly rate based on both firm fixed price projects and change orders, and time and materials expended.<br><br>If you are interested in providing general information about your company and it's potential to meet the above needs please e-mail information related to your organization's relevant: Skills and training, past performance on similar projects, technical approach, management approach, pricing methodology, availability to meet these needs, and examples of work you wish to present to:<br><br>Major Brad Willcockson<br>Project Officer<br>CENTCOM Contracting Command - Afghanistan<br>Brad.Willcockson@afghan.swa.army.mil<br><br>This is not an offer of work and any vendor efforts expended to provide information pursuant to this notice shall not incur any obligation to the government. Based on responses to this notice the government may unilaterally determine not to fulfill this requirement from non-governmental sources and may, in its sole discretion, choose to issue a solicitation or not issue a solicitation.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with RJE International, Inc. The government intends to acquire supplies using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will provide quantity of 15 each replacement low frequency long-life underwater acoustic pingers and upgrade 15 recovered pingers to 170 dB acoustic power level.<br /><br />The objective is to obtain 15 replacement pingers for July deployment in the Chukchi sea to ensure continuation of program data collection, as well as to upgrade (to 170 dB acoustic power output) the 15 currently deployed pingers after they are recovered and returned from the field. All pingers will be low-frequency, long-life, underwater acoustic pingers that will produce a series of 170 Db at 1m pulses every 1 hour for duration no shorter than 365 days for use as a reference signal in calibrating localization errors on passive acoustic recorders in the Chukchi Sea. <br /><br />The goal of the Chukchi Acoustic Oceanographic and Zooplankton study is to document the general presence of bowhead, right, fin, gray, and other whales in areas of potential seismic, drilling, construction, and production activities using passive acoustic monitoring. The proposed study will deploy three tight arrays of long-term acoustic recorders in the Chukchi Sea. Each array will consist of 5 recorders placed on sub-surface moorings spaced 2 miles apart in a pentagonal shape. These recorders will be run on a duty cycle of 1.5 hours on every 3 hours, at a sampling rate of ~ 16 kHz, for an entire year (365 days). This scheduling will allow for a long recording period that will ensure that all recorders will be on at the same time regardless of individual clock drifts. The five recorders in each array will reduce localization errors and increase the chance of localizations in the event of multiple recorder failures. Each mooring will have one pinger, thus each array will have 5 pingers. The pingers will be used as reference signals to calibrate the distance errors in our localization calculations of marine mammals passing through our study area. As sound speed in the water column can fluctuate from day to day, it is important to have calibration signals available throughout the entire deployment. We will also use these pingers to guide recovery of the moorings if the acoustic releases fail and dragging is necessary. We need a sound source that will be low enough in frequency to be detected by our recording system (frequency &lt;7kHz), and have a frequency bandwidth and an inter-pulse group interval long enough to not interfere with our signals of interest (marine mammal vocalizations). The signals emitted from the pingers must be done so in a distinct and easily recognizable pattern that can be easily distinguished from both ambient noise and the signals of interest. Furthermore, the pingers must be on/off switch activated so that the pulse timing can be dictated by the scientist to ensure time separation of the pings from all moorings in the array cluster. The instruments (pingers and recorders) will be refurbished and redeployed annually. RJE International,&nbsp;Inc&nbsp;is the vendor who designed and built the pingers currently deployed in the Chukchi Sea, they are the only vendor that can properly upgrade those pingers. It is critical that the vendor be able to both upgrade our existing set of pingers as well as provide replacement pingers that have same signal characteristics and refurbishment parts to ensure&nbsp;continuation of program data collection throughout the project. <br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract, the replacement pingers must be delivered to destination no later than July 15, 2011 and the upgraded pingers must be delivered no later than 4 months past date returned to vendor. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334290. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition estimated value not to exceed $100,000.00. <br /><br />The Western Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The government intends to acquire the services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will conduct stellar sea lion survival studies in Oregon and Northern California. <br /><br />I. Background<br />In cooperation with the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has been monitoring pinniped distribution, abundance, population trends, seasonal movements, and food habits in Oregon since 1984. In the summer of 2001, ODFW and NMML initiated a new study of the survival of the threatened Steller sea lion in the Pacific Northwest. Steller sea lions occurring from Northern California through Oregon constitute the largest and most important reproductive aggregation of this species in U.S. waters south of Alaska. In cooperation with other studies conducted by NMML and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game throughout the Steller sea lion's range, this project is aimed at obtaining comparative information on population vital rates such as age-specific survival, age at first reproduction, fecundity, as well as describing seasonal movements and distribution. This information, collected from a sub-population that is healthy and increasing in abundance, will be of great value in the assessment of causes of the significant population decline that has been observed from the Western Gulf of Alaska through the Aleutian Islands.<br /><br /><br />II. Project Objectives<br />1) In odd-numbered years (2011, 2013, etc.), capture and mark up to 200 Steller sea lion pups at the Rogue Reef rookery in southern Oregon.<br />2) Monitor the presence, distribution, and abundance of Steller sea lions in general and marked individual animals in particular, using shore and boat-based observations throughout the study area (northern California and Oregon), and possibly installation of automated digital cameras installed at Rogue Reef.<br />3) Record other data and observations as determined by cooperative planning discussions between NMML and the vendor.<br />4) Provide summaries of field work and observation data for vendor and NMML databases, and prepare annual reports summarizing project activities.<br />5) Use resight data of marked individuals to estimate population vital rates in conjunction with NMML staff.
<p><br />III. Work to be accomplished<br />1) THE VENDOR will establish and maintain storage/work facilities for this project in Gold Beach, Oregon.<br />2) This project will be cooperatively directed by the vendor Marine Mammal Research Program Leader and by NMML staff. Data analyses will be conducted cooperatively by staff from both agencies.<br />3) The vendor and NMML will work cooperatively to conduct observations and data collection activities in the study area.<br />4) The vendor will consult regularly with NMML staff regarding observation schedules, data collection protocols, data analyses, and preparation of data summaries and project reports.<br />5) The vendor and NMML will cooperatively plan and conduct biennial sea lion pup capture and marking activities. Both agencies will provide staff and logistics support to accomplish annual field research activities.<br />6) The vendor and NMML will coordinate and implement field resighting efforts from Northern California through Washington. The vendor and NMML will provide research staff to assist with this effort when it involves extensive boat and field work, primarily in the late spring through early fall period.<br />7) NMML will assist the vendor with the analysis of data and the preparation of reports for publication, with the understanding that the vendor is expected to be the lead author for these publications.<br />8) The vendor and NMML will conduct monthly vessel surveys for Steller sea lions in northern California and at Rogue Reef and Orford Reef OR. At least one survey will also be conducted in northern OR near Tillamook Rock.<br /><br />In order to conduct this research and provide the services required, the vendor must be listed on and possess the proper research permits including a NMFS MMPA research permit, an access permit from the USF&amp;WS and an Endangered Species Act Research Permit to conduct branding studies of Stellar Sea Lions on Rogue Reef. ODF&amp;W possess all these permits, they are the state agency which has the authority, responsibility and ability to conduct the research in cooperation with NMFS. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with period of performance commencing approximately from April 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 541690.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a non-competitive action for the extension of the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk (FISCN) contract N00189-05-P-1368 to Williams Scotsman, Inc. to ensure the continued leasing of one six unit trailer and three eight unit trailers for the Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) located in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  This action will allow for time for the follow-on contract to be awarded.   The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The Governments need can only be satisfied by the incumbent contractor for the immediate interim period between the existing contract and the follow-on contract.
  The fixed in place trailers provide for administrative space, utilities, Local Area Network (LAN), Video Teleconference (VTC), security and telephone capabilities.  It would be cost prohibitive to vacate and relocate these personnel.  It should be noted that NETWARCOM has received rejections for proposed modern MILCON construction at NAB Little Creek. Upon receipt of funds, NETWARCOM will immediately progress towards housing its employees in a permanent facility.  The support to be provided is critical and is necessary in order for the Navy to continue its mission.

<DESC>Synopsis: W91278-11-N-0002<br><br>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District is issuing this notice of sole source intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source for High Voltage Test Equipment that meets the specifications detailed below for West Point, Georgia.  <br><br>The Government intends to procure the proposed contract action from Doble Engineering pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  However, other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  While this notice is not a request for competitive proposals, all information received before (30-March-2011) after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  <br><br>The material specifications are as follows:<br><br>This proposed procurement is for the lease of one type M4000 test set with a capacity of 300 milliamperes at voltages from 2 to 12 kV, 60 Hertz, suitable for testing bushings, potheads, buswork, disconnect insulators, circuit breakers, instrument transformers, power transformers, lightning arresters, generator stator insulation, coupling capacitors, insulating liquid and askarels, and short lengths of station cables.  The test set will be used by the Hydropower Test Unit at West Point, Georgia as an aid in providing periodic maintenance of hydroelectric power projects.  The lease shall be for a period of one year.<br><br>Doble Engineering Company has been found to be the only company that can provide the needed test equipment on a rental basis as well as provide engineering services on an as needed basis.  Leasing is more advantageous than purchasing the equipment because the Government obtains state of the art equipment as it comes available via the modification of the contract for upgrading equipment.  Approximately 90 percent of the power producing companies in the United States are a client of Doble Engineering Company, and the right to share information is part of the rental agreement.<br><br>Written notification and supporting documentation regarding this action may be submitted in writing to US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C (John Vandiver), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or john.c.vandiver@usace.army.mil. Responses must be received within the time specified above. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. A solicitation is not available.<br>

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc., 6 Keystone Circle, Newnan, GA 30265, under authority of FAR 6.302. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District has a requirement to make changes to the existing Schweitzer protective relays system at the Jim Woodruff Powerhosue.  The transmission owner of the lines connecting into the Jim Woodruff Powerhouse's switchyard is making system changes that require protective relaying changes. The relaying changes require the same type of relay at each end of the line. The electrical power utility company uses a Schweitzer Engineering Labs model 311L. In order to facilitate the changes on the transmission owner end of the line, Jim Woodruff Powerhouse requires the use of the SEL 311L along with the SEL 451 and 587 relays.  The plant will order one 311L and one 451 relay for each line and one 587 plus spares for each, for a total of eight relays.  It is anticipated that a fixed Price contract will be awarded. The (NAICS) code is 335314 and size standard is 750 employees.<br><br>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions should be sent by email to Geanette Kelley, at geanette.kelley@usace.army.mil.  <br>

<a href="mailto:david.robledo2@amedd.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), on behalf of United States Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM), has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist the Government with analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues.<br><br>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication the CHCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This RFI was previously posted on 27 Jul 2010; however, due to revisions made to the initial requirement, we are re-posting this request.  This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  If a Solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.  This RFI does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach on a future Solicitation.<br><br>The Government's requirement is to obtain a non-personal services contract to establish a qualified medical and dental provider network for the scheduling of specialty physician and dental consultations, diagnostic tests and clinical laboratory services consisting of private civilian medical and dental professionals.  The contractor shall be required to establish a network of medical specialists and dental providers for the purpose of scheduling approximately 59,000 consultations per year over 65 Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) in geographicaly dispersed locations throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  A draft performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement.<br><br>It is anticipated that any resultant contract(s) that might result from this survey would have a period of performance from 01 October 2011 through 30 September 2012 and will have four option years.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 621111; and the small business size standard is $10.0M. <br><br>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the USMEPCOM requirements.  We recommend that you first review the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) so that you may have a better insight on the question below.<br><br>(1) Are there normally any special terms or conditions or unique contract structure associated with a contract requiring a contractor to establish a network of medical specialists and dental providers and manage the appointment scheduling of referrals for armed forces applicants of this magnitude for these services? <br><br>(2)  Is there a particular CLIN structure that is preferred (i.e. by medical specialty, by geographic location, etc.)?<br><br>(3) Are their standard commercial rates for these services?  Can prices be firm fixed for all 65 MEPS locations?<br><br>(4) How is malpractice insurance handled in referral networks?  Does the contractor maintain an umbrella policy or do individual providers have their own insurance?<br><br>(5)  Do you have a catalog or other published product literature on these services?  If so, please provide this information.<br><br>(6)  How familiar are you with HIPAA requirements?<br><br>(7)  Are there any innovative approaches used by your company for these type of services?  If so, please explain.<br><br>(8) What makes your company a market leader for this type of medical staffing service?<br><br>(9) How relavent is your past performance concerning this requirement?  Please give examples with specific contract numbers, dollar values and the magnitude of those similar services currently or previously performed and where they are performed.<br><br>(10) What is the business size standard of your company (small business, SDB, SDVOSB, Hubzoned, 8a, Large, etc)?  If 8a eligible, please provide current status regarding your scheduled graduation date from the 8a program under this NAICS code. <br><br>(11) What types of performance assessment methods are commonly used by your company and also by the contract holder?<br><br>(12) Does the Government provide sufficient detailed information in paragraphs 1.2, 1.6, 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 4.4.2, 4.4.4.4, 5.1, 5.8.2, 5.10, 5.11, 5.13, 5.17 of the PWS regarding the Virtual Interactive Processing System (VIPS) to be implemented in October 2013 after the contract has been operation so that a contractor clearly understands this new process and is able to implement this new method of transferring medical records, opinions and diagnosis back to the Government via VIPS If not, please provide comments.  Does the PWS contain sufficient direction for a contractor to prepare a pricing proposal that transitions from the traditional method of transferring medical records to the MEPS, then adjusting its price to convert over to transmitting medical records through the VIPS process in the third year of the contract?  <br><br>(13) With the implementation of VIPS, does a contractor see the change from traditional transferring of medical records to the VIPS method as additional costs to the Government or because records will be transferred electronically would there be no difference in cost or possibly a reduction in costs. (PWS paras 1.2, 1.6, 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 4.4.2, 4.4.4.4, 5.1, 5.8.2, 5.10, 5.11, 5.13, 5.17)?<br><br>(14) Prior to implementing VIPS, the network provider's contractors will be required to obtain a Common Access Card (CAC) in order to use in a Government provided, CAC enabled keyboard so that medical records can be securely transferred to a Government data base. The medical specialist's staff providing the services under this contract will have to physically travel to the nearest Government Pass and ID office to obtain their CAC  (A listing of Pass and ID offices will be added on the official solicitation). Does a contractor foresee any problems or additional costs with their network providers performing this requirement (PWS para1.6.4.6 - 1.6.7)?<br><br>(15) Network Consultants are required to be within a 30 mile radius of a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS).  Because MEPS locations are geographically dispersed within the continental U.S. and OCONUS locations, based on industry standards, what would be the best way for a competing contractor to provide pricing for their network providers and ancillary services? (i.e., by MEPS location, county, state, regions,composite rates by specialty or some other method)  Why?  <br><br>(16) Is 30 days a sufficient amount of time for a contractor to prepare a proposal given the scenario of a full trade-off best value source selection requiring a technical and price proposal and past performance references, considering the Government may also require that offerors provide a letter of commitment with 100% of their proposed network providers?  If 30 days is not sufficient, please provide a reasonable timeframe to prepare a proposal.<br><br>(17) We anticipate the contract will have a 90-day phase-in period so that the contractor may perform all pre-contract functions in order to be ready to begin full performance of the PWS by the contract start date.  Is 90 days a sufficient amount of time or should this period be shorter or longer (PWS paras 1.7 & 1.7.1)?  Does the PWS address all the efforts that may be entailed in a phase-in period?   <br><br>(18) The contractor's network providers may order ancillary services (i.e.; laboratory and diagnostic testing) as part of completing their diagnosis.  How does a contractor anticipate pricing these services?  Would a contractor also provide a network of laboratory and testing businesses to cover all of the customary procedures that a specialists listed in Exhibit 1 of the PWS could possibly order and be capable of pre-pricing these services in geographically dispersed locations?  Would these laboratory and testing businesses possibly conflict with network provider's normal choice of businesses for these services?  If so, would a CLIN to reimburse costs to the network provider work more efficiently?  <br><br><br>(20) In section 4.4.7 of the PWS, is 7 days a feasible time frame to set-up and complete a consultation with a completed medical report?  No more than 10% of consultations will exceed the 7 day timeframe.  Is this an achievable limit?<br><br>(21) Respondents to this RFI should describe their interest and ability to perform the requirements summarized within this notice by submitting a capability statement. <br><br>(22) Please give us your comments regarding the requirement for the contractor to conduct Criminal History background checks on all network providers.  See section 4.8 of the PWS.  If this is the responsibility of the contractor will costs be significant? <br><br>(23) Discuss any concerns, comments or recommendations you may have with the attached draft PWS.  Give specific PWS paragraph numbers for reference.<br> <br><br>Responses should contain Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number, CAGE Code, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 621111 (size standard $10,000,000) and GSA contract number.  Please submit all responses through e-mail to the point of contact identified in the section below.  Responses should be formatted as either MS Word (.doc) or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) and should be limited to a maximum of five (5) pages.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Office of Disease Prevention and Control 9 Phitsanulok, 306 Moo 5 Phitsanulok - Watbot Road, Phitsanulok, 65000 Thailand, to provide laboratory space and facilities for the United States Army Medical Component Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS).  Historically, this clinic has performed an essential role in malaria research at AFRIMS. The clinic has the capacity to receive malaria-infected patients and to process blood samples for further use in studies that involve either the parasite and/or infected mosquitoes with the ultimate goal of finding a mechanism for eradicating/preventing malaria.

Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing.

I. Background Information for the Event:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recognizes suppliers are crucial partners in helping it meet the challenges of supporting Veterans in the 21st century. Capitalizing on industry expertise, the department has embarked on a transformation of its end-to-end acquisition process - the Supplier Relationship Transformation (SRT). 

Since August 2009, VA has held various SRT forums throughout the country. Each forum provides VA suppliers with an opportunity to ask questions and voice concerns about the acquisitions process. This feedback is assisting VA to determine corrective policies, procedures, and actions.

In 2011, VA will continue listening to suppliers, particularly those who have not yet been to a forum. On May 4, 2011, VA will host a (southeast) regional SRT forum in Tampa, FL. The purpose of the forum is to gain more feedback from suppliers about the acquisition lifecycle, contracting matters, and other pertinent issues. 

II. Objectives of the Event:

"	Inform VA suppliers about results from the Supplier Perception Survey and previous SRT Forums and VA's corrective actions
"	Solicit facilitated feedback on VA's corrective actions

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  However, in order to facilitate the electronic submission of quotations, Request for Quotation (RFQ) number R11PS60213 is being issued simultaneously to this announcement.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for Option Period Schedule B to the total price for the base requirement in Schedule A.

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) "Termination for cause."

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)<br />(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). Conflict of Interest Certification The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. ____________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest). <br />Offeror's Name ___________________________________________________ <br />RFP/Contract No. _________________________________________________ <br />Signature ________________________________________________________ <br />Title ____________________________________________________________ <br />Date ____________________________________________________________ <br /><br /><br />310-16 POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MARCH 1985)<br />The contractor certifies that in developing a proposal in response to the solicitation for this contract, it has not utilized the services of any former Education Department (ED) employee who, while working for the Government, participated personally and substantially in, or was officially responsible for, the development or drafting of the solicitation for this contract.

In assessing past performance, the quality of the offeror's past performance is of primary significance, not the quantity of previous contracts performed. An offeror's experience will be evaluated in the technical proposal. For further guidance on including information on experience or how experience will be evaluated refer to the technical proposal instructions and evaluation criteria. <br />D. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications(e.g., the automobile industry's QS 9000, Sematech's SSQA, or ANSI/EIA-599). Identify which segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. Information about awards will be considered in evaluation of each of the past performance subfactors described in "Evaluation Criteria." The offeror may describe how the award relates to one or more of the subfactors. <br />E. No later than the date proposals are due under this solicitation, send a copy to each of your four references of the "Contractor Performance Information" form attached to this solicitation. Ask each reference to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due l0 calendar days after the date proposals are due under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. <br />F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Past Performance" form identified in Attachment D will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.<br />311-6 CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS (APRIL 1998)<br />Offerors must submit all clarification questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist. Questions may be submitted via E-Mail, fax or regular mail to: Jessalyn Mastrianni, Jessalyn.Mastrianni@ed.gov and a concurrent copy to Desandre.Woodard@ed.gov. ED will accept clarification questions until 4:30PM, Eastern time on March 29, 2011. After this date ED does not guarantee that a response will be given. Oral explanations or instructions given by the Government before the award of the contract(s) shall not be binding. Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning a solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective offerors as an amendment to the solicitation, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if a lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offerors.</p>

(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<p>(c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order.

These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph.

<p>(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

<p>(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.

The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</p>

<p>(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2) terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</p>

<p>(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</p>
<p>(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</p>
<p>(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />C.26 52.247-34 F.O.B.

<p>(b) In any option period, the contract price may be adjusted upward or downward a maximum of 10 percent.</p>
<p>(1) For the first option period, any price adjustment for the product code shall be based upon the percentage change in the PPI released in the month prior to the initial month of the contract period specified in the solicitation for sealed bidding or the month prior to award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI released in the third month before completion of the initial contract period stated in the solicitation (the updated index). This initial contract period may be less than 12 months. The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract Price (ACP) applicable to shipments during the first option period is--</p>
<p>ACP = Updated Index x Award Price<br />Base Index</p>
<p>(2) For any subsequent option period, the price adjustment shall be the percentage change between the previously updated index (the new base index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the most recent updated index). This percentage shall be applied to the Current Contract Price (CCP). The formula for determining the ACP applicable to shipments for the subsequent option period(s) is--</p>
<p>ACP = Most Recent Updated Index x CCP<br />New Base Index</p>
<p>(c) If the PPI is not available for the month of the base index or the updated index, the month with the most recently published PPI prior to the month determining the base index or updated index shall be used.</p>
<p>(d) If a product code is discontinued, the Government and the Contractor will mutually agree to substitute a similar product code. If Labor designates an index with a new title and/or code number as continuous with the product code specified above, the new index shall be used.</p>
<p>(e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment resulting from the application of the formulas in (b)(1) or (2) above is received by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the date of the Government's preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise the option, the Contractors shall have waived its right to an upward price adjustment for that option period. Alternatively, the Contracting Officer in its written notice shall exercise the option at the CCP or at a reduced price when appropriate using the formulas in (b)(1) or (2) above.</p>
<p>(f) Price adjustments shall be effected by execution of a contract modification by the Government indicating the most recent updated index and percent of change and shall apply to delivery orders placed on or after the first day of the option period.<br />C.34 552.216-72 PLACEMENT OF ORDERS (SEP 1999) (ALTERNATE I--SEP 1999) <br />(a) All delivery orders (orders) under this contract will be placed by the General Services Administration's Federal Supply Service (FSS).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

When option year pricing is based on a formula (e.g., changes in the Producer Price Index or other common standard); option year pricing is automatically considered when evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(b) The Government will reject the offer if exceptions are taken to the price provisions of the Economic Price Adjustment clause, unless the exception results in a lower maximum option year price. Such offers will be evaluated without regard to the lower option year(s) maximum. However, if the offeror offering a lower maximum is awarded a contract, the award will reflect the lower maximum.<br />E.3 EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />Offerors will be evaluated for award on the basis of their Technical Proposal and Price Proposal. Offeror's proposal shall be prepared in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors are on notice that proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexities and risks of the solicitation requirements will be rejected. Although discussions concerning technical proposals are not planned, the procurement team reserves the right to bring unacceptable offers up to an acceptable level through negotiations.</p>
<p>The following represent the technical factors used in the evaluation of proposals to determine the technical acceptability of offers:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This carbon analyzer is being acquired to establish the capability at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for traceable carbon measurements of coal samples by a definitive coulometric method.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Total Carbon Analyzer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>Basis of Analyzer Operation:<br /><br />1. Must be sample combustion followed by coulometric titration of the product CO2 for carbon analysis. <br />2. Calibration of the analyzer must be on an absolute basis (Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis), not by calibration with a reference substance. Carbon analyzers that determine CO2 via infrared absorbance are not acceptable, as they require calibration with another SRM or other standard substance.<br /><br />Overall Uncertainty:<br /><br />3. Must be 0.5% or better in terms of mass fraction of carbon for carbon-matrix samples (&gt;70% carbon), for a sample containing greater than 1 mg total mass of carbon.<br />4. Precision of titration must be 0.2% or better. <br /><br />General Requirements:<br /><br />5. Must have capability to eliminate interferences from sulfur, halides, combined nitrogen, and hydrogen in the sample (these components are converted by combustion to sulfur dioxide/trioxide, hydrochloric acid or chlorine, nitrogen oxides, or water, respectively).<br />6. Scrubbers to eliminate the interferents must be integrated within the supplied instrument.<br />7. Sample capacity must be at least 10 mg carbon per sample.<br /><br />Installation:</p>
<p>8. The Contractor shall install the analyzer. Installation shall include set-up and demonstration of the system. On-site installation and demonstration shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>Training:</p>
<p>9. The Contractor shall conduct one (1) training session for NIST personnel. The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all system functions and basic troubleshooting. The training shall be completed on-site at NIST immediately after installation.</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability, and Past Performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Provisions and Clauses:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source with Medical University of South Carolina under the authority of 13.106-1(b) only one source reasonable available to procure the continuation of services and expertise of the Video Teledermatology Project. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 611310. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and NO additional written solicitation will be issued.<br /><br />The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) will work with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and its Office of High Performance Computing and Communication (OHPCC) to research high definition (HD) video technology for remote teledermatology consultation. The research is justified because of the lack of controlled studies for many telemedicine applications generally and teledermatology applications specifically, a finding documented in two thorough telemedicine research reviews conducted for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Teledermatology studies often lack a gold standard for comparing methods and no teledermatology studies have been done employing uncompressed high definition video, only standard definition or compressed HD, which sometimes lacks quality. Commercial HD videoconferencing products that might be used for teledermatology research add compression to regular HD video which can affect quality, while the technology used in this study does not.<br /><br />The research will be conducted in accordance with a working research plan that has been developed jointly by MUSC and NLM. The plan is a working document outlining procedures and draft instruments that can be used in performing the research, but elements of it may change as instruments and methods are pilot tested and data collection begins. The main features of the plan described in this statement of work would not change, however. Specifically, MUSC will use dermatology residents and a board certified dermatologist to diagnose sufficient patients for meaningful statistical analysis under the following conditions: 1) by remote uncompressed or slightly compressed HD video, 2) by other definition (OD) video (either standard definition or highly compressed HD video), 3) by traditional store and forward (still image) methods, and 4) in-person. Each patient will be diagnosed 3 times by different residents: once by video (either HD or OD), once by store and forward methods, and once in-person. Diagnostic accuracy and confidence, decisions to biopsy and confidence, encounter quality, and technology preferences would be assessed. Half of the patients would be assessed by HD and half by OD video. Different residents would be assigned to the video, store and forward, and in-person conditions and would rotate through them so that each resident will have used each consultation method approximately the same number of times. Residents in the in-person condition will perform their consultation with a board certified dermatologist and both will confer and reach agreement on the differential and specific diagnosis and any decision to biopsy. In addition, residents and patients will complete a short scale rating the quality of the encounter for the remote video and in-person conditions and the quality of the workup and information provided for the store and forward condition.<br /><br />MUSC will provide network cabling and a desktop videoconferencing system and will recruit patients, coordinate assignment of patients and residents, collect and duplicate diagnostic and encounter-workup and information quality instruments that have been completed and forward the copies to NLM for data input and analysis. They will store the originals for at least three months after data collection is completed as back up while results are analyzed, in the event data sent to NLM are lost. The current best estimate of the number of patients required for statistical purposes is 240. <br />NLM will provide, install and maintain the video technologies used in the research and will train MUSC staff in their use. MUSC will provide the store and forward technology. NLM will assist the MUSC principle investigators in training staff on research procedures and conduct open ended interviews of MUSC staff concerning their perceptions of the technology when data collection is complete. NLM will perform data input and statistical analyses and NLM and MUSC staff will jointly work on publishing research results. NLM will retain ownership of the video equipment and will remove it at the end of the study.

The Geometrics G882 Marine Cesium Magnetometer is a high performance cesium vapor magnetometer. It has optional configurations that can include an altimeter and an echo sounder. It also has the highest rated sensitivity of any marine magnetometer in the industry at 0.0004nT/?Hz RMS. This high sensitivity is particularly important for the location of historic shipwrecks that may only have very small amounts of ferrous materials remaining to be detected. 
It is also highly portable at 44 lbs with 200 ft of cable, which is also crucial because of the fly-away needs of Submerged Resources Center instrumentation. A light-weight magnetometer like the G-882 can be shipped, carted, and carried more easily during projects in National Parks and beyond. 
Another feature of the G-882 is that it can be connected to other marine remote sensing devices, like the Klein 3000H side scan sonar that SRC owns and regularly uses. By connecting the magnetometer to the side scan, a single cable can tow both instruments which greatly reduce the risk of entanglements, have a smaller footprint for small boats like SRC's Cal Cummings, and reduce the risk of employee injury due to heavy lifting. 
Along with its compatibility with the side scan, SRC already possesses cables and ancillary hardware for a Geometrics 881 marine magnetometer that are compatible with the G-882, a slip ring that is compatible, software for the G-882, and processing software for the G-882. Parts and accessories for SRC's G-881 are interchangeable with the G-882, which greatly reduces future costs for options, provides field redundancy and reliability and will benefit the government via instrument standardization.
In addition, the magnetometer must have both a pressure sensor and an altimeter to allow for precise location of the instrument in the water column to maximize survey effectiveness and to generate data that will allow for accurate post-processing and amplification of selected data.  ___________________________________________________________________________________________ STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW):

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-50, effective March 16, 2011. This solicitation is set-aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541211. The Small Business Size Standard is 8.5 million dollars. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Revolving Fund Division has a requirement for a contractor to provide a SSAE-16 Type I Audit and Report.

<p>&nbsp;<br />I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the Federal laws prohibiting job discrimination in both the private and federal sectors--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, the Equal Pay Act, Title I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all Federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices and policies.</p>
<p>The EEOC - Revolving Fund Division (RFD) was created to broaden the EEOC's education, outreach and technical assistance programs by providing fee-based programs to EEOC stakeholder groups. The RFD (d.b.a The EEOC Training Institute), hereinafter referred to as the INSTITUTE, generates its revenue from the fee-based products and services offered to Federal, State, and Local government and Private employers and employees. The INSTITUTE offers a wide range of products and services to include seminars, webinars, courses and conferences and on-site customer-specific training programs.</p>
<p>KINSAIL Corporation is the service provider for the INSTITUTE's Payment and Registration System. EQUINIX is KINSAIL's data provider. In addition, EQUINIX is the data provider for the Agency's financial system (Momentum). EQUINIX has a valid SAS 70 Type 2 audit, KINSAIL does not have a valid SAS 70 Type 2 audit. Therefore, the audit will be limited to KINSAIL Corporation operations as it relates to the INSTITUTE's payment and registration system.</p>
<p><br />II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The INSTITUTE has a requirement for a contractor to conduct a Statement of Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE-16) Type I audit on KINSAIL Corporation's internal controls of the INSTITUTE's Payment and Registration System and to provide the INSTITUTE with a copy of the SSAE-16 report. The Agency is seeking this report for one base year and 2 one year option periods.</p>
<p>The INSTITUTE is required to monitor and control all financial transactions and to ensure that the funds received by the INSTITUTE reconcile with both U.S. Treasury and the EEOC's financial system. In addition, the INSTITUTE is required to monitor controls of systems and procedures for handling personal information and to ensure that this information is properly safeguarded.</p>
<p>KINSAIL is responsible for all payments and registration forms for EEOC training events. KINSAIL receives payment and registration documents from attendees by fax, mail or electronically via the INSTITUTE website. The INSTITUTE accepts payments by check, credit card, or purchase order.&nbsp; Purchase orders are only accepted from Federal, State or Local government agencies.</p>
<p>The SSAE-16 Type I report needs to focus on KINSAIL's internal control systems related to the processing of both on-line and paper registration forms and payments received by mail, fax and/or phone and KINSAIL's system related to the invoice of purchase orders which was described above.</p>
<p><br />III. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The SSAE-16 Type I Report is used to fulfill the EEOC's OMB A-123/FMFIA requirements to assess the adequacy of KINSAIL's internal controls and to meet the requirements of EEOC's annual financial statement audit. The annual audit requires a report prepared under the professional standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) SSAE-16 Type I report for KINSAIL which, as previously stated, is a service provider to the INSTITUTE at the EEOC. This SSAE-16 Type I report is considered an integral and necessary part of the EEOC's annual financial statement audit.</p>
<p><br />IV. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Contractor will perform a SSAE-16 Type I audit to assess the adequacy of the internal controls of KINSAIL, LLC as it relates to the EEOC's RFD program and operation. In addition, the contractor will provide a copy of the audit report to EEOC which includes an auditor's opinion on the internal controls as they relate to the control objectives relevant to the services provided by KINSAIL.&nbsp; EQUINIX is KINSAIL's data provider under this contract and EQUINIX is also the data provider for the EEOC Momentum system administered by National Business Center/Department of Interior (NBC/DOI). EQUINIX has a current SAS70 Type II audit; therefore the scope of this SSAE-16 Type I audit shall be limited to KINSAIL's operations using the carve-out clause within the SSAE guidelines.</p>
<p>This work shall be performed in strict compliance with all rules and regulations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) rules and standards established by Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagement (SSAE) 16, for a Type I report. The lead auditor must be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). A SSAE-16 Type I report provides an opinion of the internal controls as they relate to the control objectives relevant to the services provided by a third party vendor (KINSAIL). A SSAE-16 Type I report determines whether such controls were placed in operation as of a specified date in time and would be acceptable for use in the Fiscal Year requested.</p>
</p>
<p>The Type I Report is made up of 3 major areas, per the SSAE No. 16 Guidance:<br /><br />A. A description of the service organization's system prepared by KINSAIL (the service organization being audited). KINSAIL will need to prepare a description of the control objectives that are in place and being tested at their organization, as it relates to the process that is being reviewed for use by the INSTITUTE. This will describe the process and how the control objectives tie in to each other and the process as a whole, giving the INSTITUTE an overview of what and how, at a high level, their data will be handled.</p>
<p>
<p>B. A written assertion by KINSAIL's management about whether, in all material respects, and based on suitable criteria:</p>
<p>1. The description of the service organization's system fairly presents the service organization's system that was designed and implemented as of a specified date.</p>
<p>2. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the description were suitably designed to achieve those control objectives as of the specified date.</p>
<p>KINSAIL's Management will need to prepare a written assertion attesting to the fair presentation and design of controls.</p>
<p><br />C. A service auditor's report that expresses an opinion on the matters in B1 and B2.</p>
<p>1. The contractor performing the testing will need to review KINSAIL's assessment of the design of controls and attest to the validity of KINSAIL's opinion. The auditors will examine the control objectives and control activities in place at KINSAIL's office and verify they are, in fact, designed as KINSAIL noted. This is where the auditors will obtain a representative sample (per Generally Accepted Auditing Standards) of control activities and objectives to support each control activity and express the result of their testing.</p>
<p>2. The reports must provide the auditor's assessment concerning the controls systems at KINSAIL that affect the security, availability, and processing integrity of the KINSAIL system to process users' data and the confidentiality and privacy of the information processed by the service organization. This includes:</p>
<p>o The processing of financial data which would include but not be limited to cash, checks, credit cards, and government purchase orders.</p>
<p>o The handling and safe-guarding all financial and personal information on Training Institute attendees.</p>
<p>The SSAE-16 Type I Report must be provided to the EEOC each Fiscal Year (FY) no later than (NLT) June 30th . It will cover the current Federal Fiscal Year.</p>
<p><br />V. WORK TO BE PERFORMED:</p>
<p>A. Pre-Audit Field Work includes:</p>
<p><br />- The contractor sends the auditee (KINSAIL) auditor a Prepared by Client (PBC) list, according to the established Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), which consists of documents and other deliverables that must be prepared prior to commencement of the SSAE-16 Type I fieldwork that will be valid for the current fiscal year of the Federal Government.</p>
<p><br />- The contractor conducts field work according to standards established by Auditing Standards Board (ASB) and holds an in-depth meeting with the KINSAIL (the service organization being audited) to discuss findings.</p>
<p><br />- Preparation of the initial draft report begins, with collaborative effort from KINSAIL, ultimately leading to the generation of final SSAE-16 Type I Service Auditor's report.</p>
<p><br />- Final closing meeting between contractor, and EEOC to discuss final SSAE-16 Service Auditor's Report.</p>
<p><br />- Additionally, the report must be able to cover the requirements for the EEOC annual audit for SSAE-16 reports for the Fiscal Year.</p>
<p><br />B. The audit report must include the following components:</p>
<p>- Section One - Independent Service Auditor's Report (a.k.a. The Auditor's Opinion Letter).</p>
<p><br />- Section Two - The service organization's description of controls, including a description of the service organization and its services. This section also includes a description of the control environment, risk assessment process, general and application controls, monitoring procedures and information and communication systems overview. User control considerations are also inserted into the description of controls in order that user organizations are aware of controls for which they are responsible as a user of the service.</p>
<p><br />- The SSAE-16 requires the service auditor to assess whether management of KINSAIL has used suitable criteria in:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Preparing the description of the service organization's system. In making this assessment, the service auditor should determine if the criteria includes, at a minimum, management's description of the service organization's system;</p>
<p><br />&bull; Presents how the service organization's system was designed and implemented, including (if applicable): (1) the types of services provided; (2) the classes of transactions processed; (3) the procedures within both automated and manual systems by which services are provided and by which transactions are initiated, authorized, recorded, processed, corrected (as necessary), and transferred to the reports and other information prepared for user entities; (4) the related accounting records and supporting information involved in initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, and reporting transactions; (5) how the service organization's system captures and addresses significant events and conditions (other than transactions); (6) the process used to prepare reports and other information for user entities; (7) the specified control objectives and controls designed to achieve those objectives, including complementary user entity controls contemplated in the design of the service organization's controls; and (8) other aspects of the service organization's control environment, risk assessment process, information and communication systems, control activities, and monitoring controls that are relevant to the services provided.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Includes relevant details of changes to the service organization's system during the period covered by the description (as in the case of a type 2 report); and does not omit or distort information relevant to the service organization's system, while acknowledging that the description of the service organization's system is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their auditors.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evaluates whether controls were suitably designed to achieve the control objectives stated in management's description. In making this assessment, the service auditor should determine if the criteria include, at a minimum, whether Kinsail has identified the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives stated in its description of the service organization's system;<br />and identifies controls that would, if operating as described, provide reasonable assurance that those risks would not prevent the control objectives stated in the description from being achieved.</p>
<p><br />- Section Three - Other information provided by management of the service organization, such as management's response to testing exceptions. This unaudited section of the report is optional and does not appear in all reports.</p>
<p><br />C. The SSAE-16 Type 1 Report must provide an independent auditor's opinion on KINSAIL's control systems based on the requirements of the SSAE. The report must provide a description of KINSAIL's control environment including the control objectives and processes currently implemented by KINSAIL. In addition, the auditor's report must include recommendations on controls and processes for future implementation.</p>
<p><br />VI. KEY PERSONNEL</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall provide a qualified person who will be designated as key to perform all requirements specified within this RFQ.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>Factor 1. Technical<br><br>Factor 2.  Past Performance<br><br>Factor 3.  Price:  Price will be evaluated using various price analysis techniques and procedures, including, but not limited to,  comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison of proposed prices with the Independent Government Estimate, as well as any other pricing information available to the Government to establish fair and reasonable pricing and a balanced offer. <br><br>Factor 1.  Technical <br>                                   <br>FACTOR  1A.  Technical Capability:  The offeror shall provide a technical description of the services being offered in sufficient detail to include its proposed approaches to meet the requirements of this solicitation:  Specifically, the technical proposal shall address the following:  Contractor shall provide the following disposables:  Neurovision or Equal, per surgical case: <br>     <br>Order No. 8010002 : NeuroVision Screw Test Module with Pedicle Probe/Includes:<br>     Neurovision EMG Harness Kit<br>     25Recording surface electrodes<br>     5 Reference surface electrodes<br>     1 JJB Sterile Pedicle Probe<br><br>Contractor shall provide the following system, as stipulated at Paragraph 1.6.3. <br>Neurovision or Equal, for use during surgical cases:<br>Category No. 2011000 Neuro Vision JJB System to consist of:<br>     2011002 NV JJB Control Unit<br>     2011003 NV JJB Patient Module<br>     2011010 NV JJB Screw Test Handpiece<br>     2011050 NV JJB Screw Test Handpiece Nut<br>     2011051 NV JJB InStim K-Wire Insulator Adapter<br>     2011009 NV JJB Surgical Accessory Cable<br>     2011008 NV JJB Handpiece Sterilization Case<br><br>If providing an "equal", please comply with FAR Clause 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal.<br><br>FACTOR 1B.  Technical Qualifications:  A certificate in Neurophysiologic Intraoperative Monitoring (CNIM) through the American Board of Registration of Electroencephalographic and Evoked Potential Technologists (ABRET), or certification from the American Board of Neurophysiologic Monitoring (ABNM).  <br><br>Factor 1 is equal in importance to Factor 2, when combined, are more important than Price. <br><br>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. <br><br>Given that FAR 52.217-8 provides that the Government may exercise the Option to Extend Services at the rates specified in the contract (i.e., the rates in effect when the Extension of Services option is exercised), for purposes of evaluating the Option to Extend Services, the Contracting Officer will consider the prices submitted for the base year and each option year, since those are the binding prices should the Option to Extend be exercised.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. <br><br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br> (End of provision)<br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br><br>Award will be made using the best value trade-off source selection process.  Award will be made on the basis of the best value offered to the Government of proposals meeting or exceeding the satisfactory standards for the non-cost factors.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, is deemed acceptable to the Government, and whose proposal offers the best value to the Government all factors considered.<br><br>It is contemplated that award will be made without discussions with offerors (except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification).  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.   If the Government enters into discussions, a competitive range will be established based on the evaluated price and other evaluation factors included in the solicitation.  The Government will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<br><br>Proposal Ratings:<br><br>An offeror must receive a rating of at least satisfactory under Factor 1 before being considered further under Factors 2, and 3.  That is, if an offeror does not describe Factor 1, their proposal shall not be considered under each of the remaining factors, and thus be ineligible for award.  Further, an offeror must receive a rating of at least satisfactory in each of Factors 2 and 3 in order to be considered for award.  <br><br>1. Ratings of an offeror's proposal reflect the Government's confidence in each offeror's ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements stated in the solicitation.  The following rating scheme for Technical (Factor 1A and 1B) will be used: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, and Marginal.  The rating scheme is defined below:<br><br><br>ADJECTIVE	DEFINITION AND CRITERIA <br>Excellent 	The proposal demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The proposal has no weaknesses or deficiencies.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.  Risk Level: Very Low. <br>Good 	The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  The proposal has no deficiencies and any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.  Risk Level:  Low. <br>Satisfactory	The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses and no deficiencies.  The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of successfully meeting the requirements. Risk Level:  Low.<br>Marginal 	The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses or minor deficiencies that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.  <br>Risk Level: Moderate.  <br><br><br>2. Performance risk is defined as "ratings that assess the risks associated with each offeror's likelihood of success in performing the requirements stated in the solicitation based on the offeror's performance record on similar contract efforts.  The following rating scheme for Performance Risk will be used:  Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Neutral.<br><br><br><br>ADJECTIVE	<br>DEFINITION AND CRITERIA<br><br>Excellent	Overall performance exceeds contractual requirements and gives extra benefits to the customer.  Problems, if any, were promptly corrected without negative impact to the customer.  Risk level: Very  Low.<br><br>Satisfactory	Performance meets contractual requirements, but does not exceed them.  The contractual performance contains some minor problems for which corrective actions were taken by the contractor were satisfactory.  Risk Level:  Low.<br><br>Marginal	Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractor's proposed actions to correct any problems were only marginally effective, or were not fully implemented.  Risk Level:  Moderate.  <br><br>Neutral	If an offeror has no experience in providing ambulance services, the offeror shall be rated as "Unknown."  The offeror has little/no relevant past performance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Risk Level: Unknown.<br><br> <br>3.  All offers must receive a rating of at least at satisfactory, in all areas, in order to be considered eligible for award.<br><br>WAWF Instructions (local clause available via e-mail request).<br><br>Offerors must complete FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial items or do so on-line at http://orca.bpn.gov. <br><br>Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) to be eligible for award.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-Q-P30BX4 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.

<DESC>DEADLINE for this Solicitation has remains COB EDST, Tuesday March 22nd, 2011.<br><br>ADDITION OF FAR CLAUSE 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns.  As this is Full and Open Competition, inclusion of this provision in the solicitation is mandatory pursuant to FAR sec. 19.308(b).  No additional time to respond is warranted as late disclosure of this provision does not prejudice any potential offeror.  This clause is mandatory and serves a fundamental acquisition purpose.<br><br>An updated Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is attached.  The Statement of Work remains the same.<br><br>RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS FROM OFFERORS<br><br>Please see the attached revised Combined Synopsis/Solicitation and the revised Statement of Work. Changes made were minor in order to clarify questions from potential offerors.<br><br>No offeror will be excluded from the competitive range for minor or immaterial deviations from the combined synopsis/solicitation. If necessary there will be discussions and each offeror within the competitive range will be given an opportunity to correct any minor deficeincies and submit a best and final offer.<br><br>With regards to origin information of major components and assemblies - we are not trying to create an unreasonable burden for any offeror. It is not necessary to disclose the origin of individual fasteners or other common parts. Disclosing one level of manufacture is anticipated to be adequate disclosure. If more information is required from an offeror in the competitive range, discussions will be conducted.<br><br>Some offerors wanted clarification of the reference to 13 CFR 121.406 that "there can<br>be only one manufacturer of an end item." As a practical matter, if any business concern assembles the end item of any other business concern (regardless of whether or not they label it as their own or advertises it as the product of another company) both business concerns cannot be considered the manufacturers of the same end item; only one business concern can be designated as its manufacturer.<br><br>Since this is a solicitation issued pursuant to Full and Open Competition and without a Small Business Set-Aside as a practical matter Title 13 does not apply. However, since future small business set-asides are planned, our goal is to achieve some consistency and uniformity for providers when they label themselves as a manufacturer, distributor, assembler or reseller. Generally, many providers will qualify for each label on an item by item basis. If you have any questions concerning how we might classify you for any particular item - we will be happy to discuss the individual factors with you. <br><br>Since this is a Full and Open Competition solicitation the request for information regarding status as a manufacturer is informative and not dispositive.<br><br>

<DESC>THE ABOVE REFERENCED NOTICE IS AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:<br /><br />ADD&nbsp;QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:<br /><br /><br />QUESTION:(1) All material is to be prepared to -212 microns, thus, meeting ISO requirements as well as ASTM. There would be no reason that "ISO" labs should reject the NIST SRM as being acceptable for use (as all ISO test methods require reduction to 212 microns prior to testing). This is part of our normal coal sample preparation process and is done at no additional cost to NIST.
<p>ANSWER:<br />Regarding the requirement in item 4 "Then crush and pulverize the gross sample (approximately 1,400 lbs.) to 100 % passing 250 &#61549;m (No. 60)sieve. Contractor must screen material using 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve . . .<br />NIST requires that the material be -250 &#61549;m sieve. If the Contractor prefers to prepare the material so that it is 212 &#61549;m (to meet ISO requirements), that is an acceptable option, but it is not necessary to meet the requirements of the statement of work.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION (2) In item 9 under contractor requirements it states<br />"...and identify all bottles by their sublot # and fill order number, without labeling or marking on the bottles themselves"<br />Does this mean that we can use some type of outer packaging that is marked with the sub lot and fill order number? This outer packaging could be a plastic bag, bubble wrap, cardboard tube, etc.<br /><br />ANSWER:<br />Regarding the requirement in item 9"...and identify all bottles by their sublot # and fill order number, without labeling or marking on the bottles themselves":<br />As noted in item 10, the filled bottles are to be shipped back to NIST in their original containers (the boxes that the bottles are in when they are shipped to the Contractor). The sublot # and fill order number sequence can be marked on each box of bottles in a manner that clearly indicates how the bottles are ordered inside the box.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION (3) In item 10 under contractor requirements it states<br />"After its cap has been secured, wipe clean the exterior of each filled bottle and its cap with alcohol and then package the bottles in their original containers."<br />What are the "original" containers? Does each bottle come in its own outer cardboard container which is how NIST typically ships their samples? Do you mean that "x" number of bottles comes in box 1 and we are to repackage in box 1? From personal experience the last set of bottles we ordered were shrink wrapped on a tray. These bottles were not shipped with caps on. Once you put the caps on the bottles and stack them in a box the height of the bottles could prevent the box from closing properly. In addition, to maintain the sub lot integrity we would like to pack each sub lot separately.</p>
<p><br />ANSWER:</p>
<p>Regarding the requirement in item 10 "After its cap has been secured, wipe clean the exterior of each filled bottle and its cap with alcohol and then package the bottles in their original containers.":</p>
<p>The original containers are the boxes that the bottles are in when they are shipped to the Contractor. The boxes hold 180 capped bottles in three layers of 60 bottles each (6 X 10). Since these bottles do not yet contain SRMs ready to be packaged for sale, each bottle will not have the outer cardboard container associated with a typical SRM. If the contractor prefers to maintain the sublot integrity by packing each sublot of bottles separately (instead of in their original box), that is an acceptable option, but it is not necessary to meet the requirements of the statement of work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This requirement is unrestricted and all interested vendors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p><br />All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) Packaging of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2684c</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Packaging of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2684c</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background: NIST recently obtained four 55-gallon drums of bituminous coal (approximately 1400 lbs; approximately 635 kg) that requires crushing, pulverization, screening, and subsequent spin-riffling into bottles for a renewal coal SRM. New coal material was required for this renewal SRM (SRM 2684c) as reserve material for the replacement SRM had run out.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives of Procurement: The overall goal of this project is to package the coal material so that it is ready for delivery to the NIST customer. The intention is to issue the coal material as a NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM), and attaining excellent homogeneity (within the inherent limitations of heterogeneity in the processed coal matrix) during material processing is an important consideration. The specific objectives of this project require the entire lot of coal material to be crushed and pulverized followed by screening and then spin-riffle division of the entire lot into four equal portions followed by the spin riffling of one of the four portions into approximately 2500 bottles. The remaining three spin-riffled portions, each in their separate drum with liner, shall be readied for shipment to NIST. The shipping of the three drums, packaged bottles, and requested residual material will be paid for by NIST.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Receive (4 drums) of 2" x 0" Bituminous Coal (approximately 1,400 lbs.) and 2880 bottles. The four drums of coal material and packaged bottles will be shipped to the Contractor from NIST.</p>
<p>2. Send all requested information (e.g., measurement data) to the NIST Contracting Officer representative (COR) via email once it is obtained.</p>
<p>3. The Government reserves the right to be present at the Contractor's site to witness the preparation and packaging. The Contractor shall notify the NIST COR of the tentative preparation and packaging schedule at least 3 business days prior to the scheduled start of the crushing of the coal so that the NIST COR can plan travel. All travel and per diem shall be conducted at NIST's expense.</p>
<p>4. Air dry gross coal sample and report the air-dried gross sample mass to the NIST COR. Then crush and pulverize the gross sample (approximately 1,400 lbs.) to 100 % passing 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve. Contractor must screen material using 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve, saving any plus 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) material for return to NIST in a sealed container.</p>
<p>5. Blend the approximately 1,400 lbs. by recombining opposite portions produced by the spin riffler or by an appropriate sized blender. The blending procedure must be designed to ensure that the material is well-mixed.</p>
<p>6. Spin riffle -250 &#61549;m (No. 60) mesh material into four equal splits. Prior to any additional processing, weigh each split, identify the split to be bottled (as the fourth split) and report the masses of each split to the NIST COR. The Contractor shall determine if the mass of the fourth split is suitable for providing 2500 &#61617; 300 bottles of coal material under the conditions specified in the requirements below. If the Contractor determines that they will be able to deliver between 2200 and 2800 bottles of coal, they can proceed with processing. If not, they must stop processing, and shall notify the NIST COR and the NIST Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. Place the first three of the four equal spin riffled splits of -250 &#61549;m (No. 60) material into three separate drums, each double-lined, (each liner must be &ge; 4 mm thickness). Take one grab sample of approximately 50 g from each of the three spin-riffled drums and perform sulfur and ash measurements for an initial assessment of variability. Report the measurement data to the NIST COR. After grab samples are taken, secure each liner with zip-ties or another bag closure that minimizes any air within the bag. The coal material shall not be exposed directly to the drum.</p>
<p>8. Process the entire fourth split of approximately 350 lbs. (approximately 160 kg) of the 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) coal material by spin riffling all of this coal material into the number of sublots needed for subsequent spin riffling into 2500 &#61617; 300 bottles (must use pre-cleaned bottles and caps supplied by NIST) containing at least 50 grams each, while maintaining sufficient headspace to allow for mixing of the contents in the bottles provided.</p>
<p>9. Store (away from dust or contamination) all bottles in the containers in which they were shipped according to fill order, and identify all bottles by their sublot # and fill order number, without labeling or marking on the bottles themselves. Each sublot must represent the bottles produced in the final division by spin riffling and the number of positions in the spin riffler equals the number of bottles in each sublot of material.</p>
<p>10. After its cap has been secured, wipe clean the exterior of each filled bottle and its cap with alcohol and then package the bottles in their original containers.</p>
<p>11. Remove the first and last bottles filled and one bottle each from two different middle sublots (4 bottles total) and determine the net weight of each bottle. Then perform a screen test on the contents of each bottle at 250 &#61549;m (No. 60), with the % greater than 250 &#61549;m and the % less than 250 &#61549;m to be reported to the NIST COR, along with the net weight (prior to performing the screen test), for each bottle. Retain the residual contents of these bottles until NIST has received all of the prepared coal material (i.e., drums and filled bottles).</p>
<p>12. Remove a bottle from each sublot for S and ash measurements. Perform duplicate measurements of S and ash on each of the bottles and report all of the measurement data, for each bottle, to the NIST COR. The NIST COR will review this measurement data to determine if the material has an acceptable degree of homogeneity (as specified in the inspection and acceptance criteria below) and report back to the Contractor whether or not the material meets the homogeneity criteria within 8 calendar days of receipt of the measurement data. Retain these sublot bottles until NIST has received all of the prepared coal material (i.e., drums and filled bottles).</p>
<p>13. The packages of bottles containing the coal material from the spin riffled sublots of the fourth split, the other three spin riffled splits (in double lined drums), and any plus 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) material shall be readied for shipment to NIST. The Contractor shall notify the NIST COR of the number of bottles filled, the number of sublots, the number of bottles in each sublot, and the number of packages of bottles that will be shipped to NIST. NIST will arrange for pick-up and handle shipping costs. This will be FOB Origin, meaning the Government assumes all responsibility for shipping and pays all shipping charges. For shipping items back to NIST the Contractor shall use the NIST FEDEX account. The account number will be provided at award.</p>
<p>14. All work shall be completed, all reports on measurement data and results sent to NIST, and all material shipped to NIST, within 13 weeks of the Contractor receiving the materials. The time period for NIST to report to the Contractor on whether the material has an acceptable degree of homogeneity (8 calendar days or less) is included as part of the 13 weeks.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to have a representative on site to observe the process.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Delivery of 2500 &#61617; 300 bottles containing at least 50 grams each.<br />2. Delivery of 3 spin-riffled splits in 3 drums.<br />3. Delivery of all material after crushing, pulverizing, and screening that remains on a 250 &#61549;m (No. 60) sieve. Return this in a sealed container of the Contractor's choice.<br />4. All measurement data reported to the NIST COR via email.<br />5. Report on the number of bottles filled, the number of sublots, the number of bottles in each sublot, and the number of packages of bottles that will be shipped to NIST.<br />6. Reports of measurement data to the Government under Contractor Requirements 4, 6, 7 and 11 are informational only and will not require COR approval.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The net mass of each bottled coal portion shall not be less than 50 g of material. <br />2. The NIST COR will inspect the bottles and drums of coal material upon arrival at NIST. Bottles will be inspected to assess whether the correct number of bottles were delivered based on what was reported and that the mass of coal in each bottle is at least 50 g with sufficient headspace to allow for mixing of the contents. The drums will be inspected to assess the correct number of drums were returned and that the coal has been spin-riffled.<br />3. In addition, acceptance of the material will be based on the results of the screening and data reported, including determination, at the 95 % confidence level, of an acceptable degree of homogeneity among the sulfur and ash sublot measurements determined by standard statistical comparisons of between- and within- bottle variability (e.g., ANOVA).</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property (GFP): Quantity/Value</p>
<p>Upon award, NIST shall provide to the Contractor:</p>
<p>1. 2880 pre-cleaned amber glass bottles and screw caps. NIST will ship 2880 amber glass bottles to the Contractor for spin-riffle bottling of the fourth split. An excess number of bottles (80) will be shipped to allow for any breakage or bottle material wastage. The value of the pre-cleaned bottles is $1900,<br />2. 4 drums of 2" x 0" Bituminous Coal (approximately 1400 lbs.). The value of the coal before processing is $1000.<br />3.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>This requirement will require the&nbsp;contractor at their own expense to come to Hill AFB in Utah for&nbsp;an industry day on March 3rd at 9:00 AM Mountain time and if need be March 4th at 9:00AM.&nbsp;The industry day&nbsp;is being held so the&nbsp;contractors can come in and take measurements of the various aircraft rims.&nbsp;There are 21&nbsp;different aircraft rims which we need 34&nbsp;different custom molds created for. The molds will be used to&nbsp;create&nbsp;the paint masks.&nbsp;Various quantities of these&nbsp;paint masks will be needed over the next 5 years so we will be awarding an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to the successful contractor. The masks are needed to cover the following areas on the rims: race guards, bearing bore areas, and tiebolt areas. The painting process uses an accelerated paint drying process that drys the parts in 1 hour. Therefore, these masks need to be able to withstand temperatures up to 200 degress in and IfraRed based over. The&nbsp;temperatures do not exceed 200 degrees. We currently do not have any&nbsp;drawings with specifications; therefore, the&nbsp;using activity will be able to make available 75 percent of the&nbsp;rims from the requirement during the industry&nbsp;day.&nbsp;Once the initial industry day is done, as part of your bid proposal we will ask you to include your expected cost for two subsequent visits by an employee of your company to come measure the remaining wheel&nbsp;rims that were not available during the initial industry day. Obviously, until your company has measurements, you would not be able to produce a mold and mask; nevertheless, in order for us to be able to award this proposal to your company we would need you to be able to estimate a cost for all wheel&nbsp;rims knowing that the use of the masks are going to be for one of three areas. Once again, these three areas are the race guard, bearing bore cover, or tiebolt area. The requirement will require the contactor to be capable of designing the mask according to&nbsp;how they feel it should be designed to function properly.<br /><br />The pictures taken at the site visit have been emailed out to the contractors who attended the site&nbsp;visit. If&nbsp;your company is interested&nbsp;in&nbsp;this requirement and would like the pictures please email the point of contract. &nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers:<br /><br />Q: On the TEP spares worksheet, if an item is marked RESERVED it is our understanding that we do not need to provide an estimate of cost and that we will not need to supply the item. Is that correct?<br /><br />A: Do not need to provide estimate on any RESERVED spaces. At this time and at time of award, item does not need to be supplied by the contractor. After contract award and during the performance of the<br />contract, if the item is required then a new quote will be requested by the Government at that time.
<p><br />Q: In the Computer Equipment.xls barcode software and scanner is listed on lines 6 &amp; 43. Can we assume that all TDC inventory has been barcoded and scanned into a database? Will this database be delivered to the awarded contractor?</p>
<p>A: The Bar Code scanners were requested by the current contractor to improve their inventory tracking system, they did not use them; the database they are using does not have barcode information stored in it. The software for the Database will be included to the awarded contractor.</p>
<p>Q: Will a barcode printer be delivered with the equipment? <br /><br />A: There is no Barcode printer in the current inventory.</p>
<p>Q: Request clarification of spare items on the TEP spreadsheet. <br /><br />A: See updated TEP spreadsheet in amendment 6 of the RFP for items S034, S035, S057, S058, S059, S083, S091, S160, S168, S187, S188, S189, S190, S191, S192, S193, S198, S199, S211, S227, S230, S236, S252, S256, S257, S258, S259, S265, S269, S271, S272, S296, S299, S344, S345, S349, S353, S361, S383, S395, S430, S432, S457, S461, S554, S555, S569.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br><br>At the bottom of page under Additional Info Please click on Additional Documentation Link to review updated attachment titled "Q&A 22March2011" for responses to questions posed by Contractors for Sources Sought notice for the C4ISR Command Common Computing Platform, Family of Market Survey Questionnaire.<br><br>The response date for this notice has been extended to 30 March 2011<br><br>*** Please Review revision to last sentence in this questionnaire ***<br><br>C4ISR Mission Command Common Computing Platform,<br>Family of <br>Market Survey Questionnaire<br><br>The Army's modernization effort of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) has introduced a multitude of new and improved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipments that will enhance the soldier's ability to plan, monitor, communicate and execute the mission.  Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission.  Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions.  Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/Output devices and installations kits within a command vehicle has reached the saturation point.  The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern.  <br><br>To alleviate these concerns, the Government intends to procure a common computing system that will be shared by multiple C4ISR programs / applications.  The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to canvas industry to obtain feedback regarding the Government's requirement for a C4ISR Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P).   It cannot be overstated that the government is looking for a low cost common computing system that will address the MC3P requirements.  The MC3P can be a combination of one or more computers /components making up the system to address the increasing levels of computing complexity.  This can then logically translate to a family of computers sharing the same common baseline. <br><br>The Government envisions a Family of MC3P computers; initial notional thoughts are there will be three capability levels of computers: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.  All three MC3P computer variants' would support the initial realization of the Mounted Computing Environment as well as be communications/transport agnostic.  The relative quantities or percentages of Basic, Intermediate and Advanced computer systems are on the order of 80%, 15%, and 5% respectively.  Initial fielding quantities are for 3 BCT's.  It is not the Government's intention to replace all fielded FBCB2 JV-5 computers with MC3P's but instead to enhance the BCT's for mission specific requirements detailed below.  Additionally it should be noted that any resulting contract vehicle for the MC3P may be used to fulfill the follow-on computer requirements for PM FBCB2 either JBC-P or re-fresh. Requirements or capabilities for the three variants are described below. <br><br>1. The family of computing and display hardware must provide general purpose computing resources in both a mounted and dismounted configuration to host, execute, and meet the hardware requirements of one or more software applications and/or application suites running simultaneously that will provide a variety of capabilities. The family of computing hardware will host capabilities including, but not limited to:<br><br>a. Situational Awareness / C2 / Battle Command - including current applications like JBC-P, TIGR, CPOF, MTS (or JBC-P Log), AFATDS/FOS, and DCGS-A (analyst workstation); and future applications to be developed.  <br><br>b. Sensor data processing and display including display of current combat platform sensor feeds such as driver's viewers, 360 degree situation awareness cameras, shot detection systems such as Boomerang, the LRAS3, CLOE, CBRN sensors, Mounted Soldier System (MSS) Helmet Mounted Display and combat vehicle mounted FLIR sensors.  The capability will include reduction of GPS devices on vehicles, north seeking modules or Inertial Navigation Systems for the purpose of internal processing or distribution to other on board systems. The capability must allow growth for additional sensors yet to be developed.<br><br>c. On-board Platform Network Management - including control of combat net radios, routing of data between terrestrial and SATCOM radios (e.g. BFT 2 & WIN-T PoP/SNE), network monitoring, enterprise services integration (e.g. AD, PKI, Radius, HBSS), cross-banding between two different networks, MSS cordless communications and SWAP/space-claim deconfliction (e.g., the proposed system must be capable of routing multiple voice formats (analog, serial, VoIP).<br><br><br>2. The family of computing and display hardware will host software and/or software applications based on the capabilities required of the leader in accordance with his/her role.   Below are Example categories of the potential capabilities:<br><br><br>a. Basic Capability: Junior NCO leaders - C2/SA mounted platform running JBC-P/MTS/FOS and platform integration of SW, radio controls, one display and user input device, and organic on-board sensors.<br><br>b. Intermediate Capability: Junior/mid-grade staff officers and senior NCO leaders - C2/SA with dismountable capability platform running JBC-P and platform integration of SW, radio controls and cross-banding between different networks, multiple security enclaves, network/node management, enterprise services, routing between terrestrial and SATCOM radios, two displays and user input devices for select platforms (one for Infantry dismounts), and organic on-board sensors.<br><br>c. Advanced Capability: Commanders and Mnvr S3 leaders -  C2/SA with dismountable capability platform running JBC-P/TIGR/CPOF/DCGS-A (analyst workstation)/ AFATDS and platform integration of SW, multiple security enclaves, network management, enterprise services, radio controls, routing between terrestrial and SATCOM radios, cross-banding between different networks, two displays for Co Cdrs (one for JBC-P and one for CPOF/TIGR) & four displays and user input devices for BCT and Bn Cdrs (one for JBC-P for the TC, and 3 for maneuver, fires and Intel staff), and organic on-board sensors. In addition the capability to receive and view off-board sensor data from UAS or other yet to be determined sensors.<br><br>If industry has an alternative capability approach to the above example then suggest it be provided along with basis and rationale.   <br><br>3. To the maximum extent possible, the family of computing hardware must allow for the receipt and processing of sensor data from a variety of sensor platforms both on-board and off-board the mobile platforms.  Any cross domain solution necessary to accept sensor data may be implemented internally or externally to the computing hardware itself.  Any external solution would still be considered part of the family of computing hardware.<br><br>4. The family of computing hardware will not be expected to host and execute software that is considered real-time and/or safety-critical.<br><br>5. To the extent possible the family of computers should look to take full advantage of Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) savings opportunities.  The MC3P computer should comply with the SWAP requirements for the FBCB2 JV5 computer.    <br><br>6. To the extent possible and feasible, the family of common computer hardware should be implemented using a modular approach so as to allow flexibility of the hardware to meet the capabilities required of the leader as per his/her role.<br><br>7. To the maximum extent possible, the family of computing hardware should be designed to allow for incremental upgrades to increase computing resources (e.g. CPU, RAM, storage) as technologies mature.<br><br>8. The family of computing hardware should be designed with reasonable spare computing resources (e.g. CPU, RAM, GPU, storage) to accommodate additional future capabilities without the need to upgrade components.<br><br>9. The family of computing hardware must be ready to begin fielding by 1QFY13. An incremental approach may be required to support all use cases.<br><br>10. It is the Government's desire for the Basic MC3P hardware system unit production cost goal to be less than $10K in procurement quantities of 10,000 per year.  Total procurement may be as high as 100,000 units worldwide.<br><br>11. The MC3P System platform must be capable of operating on Army tactical ground vehicles, tracked and wheeled.  Essentially the MC3P hardware must meet at a minimum the same environmental requirements as the FBCB2 JV5 computer.  This specification is available for review as part of this RFI.<br><br>12. The MC3P System Display must have an internal touch screen capability and be fully sunlight readable in bright sunshine, with brightness level that is gradually adjustable from full brightness to total blackout conditions for night time operations.<br><br>13. The contractor must provide the US Government with the necessary documentation and Government purpose data rights for the MC3P Family of Computing Hardware equipment sufficient for one or more alternate suppliers to build equipment that will be fully compatible with the MC3P.<br><br>14. It is desired that the MC3P architecture be based upon adequately mature commercial technology to enable a short first article prove out cycle and production lead time such that the Government can procure and field this capability beginning in 1QFY13.  Incremental approaches will be evaluated also.<br><br>Acronym List:<br>C2:  Command and Control<br>SA: Situational Awareness<br>FBCB2: Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below<br>JBC-P:  Joint Battle Command - Platform<br>TIGR: Tactical Ground Reporting<br>CPOF: Command Post of the Future<br>MTS: Movement Tracking System<br>AFATDS/FOS: Advanced Field Artillery Target Designation System / Forward Observer System<br>DCGS-A: Distributed Common Ground System- Army<br>LRAS3: Long-Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System<br>CLOE: Common Logistics Operating Environment<br>CBRN: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear<br>FLIR: Forward Looking Infrared Radar<br>GPS/PNT: Global Positioning System / Position Navigation & Timing<br>SATCOM: Satellite Communications<br>BFT-2:  Blue Force Tracking -2<br>WIN-T PoP/SNE: Warfighter Information Network, Point of Presence / Solider Network Extension<br>MSS: Mounted Soldier System<br>CPU: Central Processing Unit<br>RAM: Random Access Memory<br>GPU: Graphics Processing Unit<br><br><br>Vendor Questionnaire<br><br>The intent of this questionnaire is to organize vendor responses to this RFI.

<DESC>Due to the length of time since the original market survey for solicitation W52P1J-09-R-0163 was posted, the Government is issuing an amendment to the market survey to update its market research. If you previously submitted information to the original market survey, please confirm your interest or provide any updated or new information for Government consideration.<BR><BR>The US Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of supplying any of the following Large Caliber Metal Parts:<BR><BR>- Artillery 105mm Projectile Metal Parts:<BR>o M314A3<BR>o M927<BR>o PGU 45 HF<BR><BR>- Artillery 155mm Projectile Metal Parts:<BR>o M549A1<BR>o M825A1<BR><BR>The Government anticipates soliciting offerors for award of multiple Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to deliver the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps FY10-FY14 Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts production requirements. It is anticipated that multiple five year IDIQ contracts will be awarded. Each item shall be proposed upon individually and shall be evaluated separately. Should an RFP be released, and an offeror desires to propose on more than one item, a separate proposal shall be submitted for each item. The USG may also issue split awards on a given requirement in an effort to foster future competition. Potential contractors possessing the technical, financial and facility resources necessary to meet the Governments requirements will initially be qualified by being awarded an IDIQ contract and then compete for delivery orders as requirements arise. <BR><BR>Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience and capability, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the required quantities of Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts and obtain the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver these Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts at a high rate of production. The Large Caliber Projectile Metal Parts make up the shell bodies which are hollow cylindrical steel shells, topped by an open ogive-shaped nose, with a closed boattail at the rear of the projectile. The front end has a female thread that will be assembled with a lifting plug during transportation and handling. A metal rotating band encircles the projectile near the base end. There are two types of artillery shell bodies being procured; High Explosive (HE) and Smoke/Illuminating.<BR><BR>Production of Projectile Bodies requires a number of specialized processes and specialized equipment. Interested sources will need to have the capability to hot forge Projectile Bodies that are in excess of 20 inches long and have finished weights in excess of 70lb. This requires forging presses with capabilities in excess of 1,000 tons, and strokes commensurate with the Projectile Body length, as well heating capabilities to bring the forging mults to temperature. Some of the Bodies included in this sources sought utilize swaged Rotating Bands, while others have Rotating Bands that must be overlay welded in place. This overlay welding process requires highly specialized Rotating Band welding equipment. The majority of the Bodies produced under this effort will need to undergo a 100% Ultrasonic inspection, which requires highly specialized test equipment. <BR><BR>A TDP will be made available should a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) be released at a later date.<BR><BR>For purposes of this market survey, the following approximate quantities represent a high rate of monthly production for each item:<BR><BR>- Artillery 105mm Projectile Metal Parts:<BR>o M314A3  2,500 each<BR>o M927  5,000 each<BR>o PGU 45 HF  5,000 each<BR><BR>- Artillery 155mm Projectile Metal Parts:<BR>o M549A1  5,000 each<BR>o M825A1  6,000 each<BR><BR>Interested sources should supply the capacity for each product independently, and should describe where cross-product operations may be shared (Forge, Heat Treat, Machining, Pack-out, Paint, etc). This type of information provides the USG with the basic interdependencies between the product lines for planning purposes. A requirements matrix has not been prepared nor is there any timeline on when one may be prepared. The sources sought information is for planning purposes as this time. <BR><BR>The information submitted may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a required production line. Contractors shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience as a manufacturer, proven monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the company is a large or small business. Contractors shall also identify the specific item(s) that they are interested in when responding to this market survey.<BR><BR>This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. The Government will not reimburse any respondent for any effort or information submitted in response to this sources sought. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. The contractor shall provide all information requested in this notification within 15 days of this publication by electronic mail at no cost to the Government, to katherine.e.crawford@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.<BR>

<DESC>1.  Introduction/PurposeThe FAA has a requirement for Modernization of the Air Traffic open training program.  The FAA needs to provide lower-cost and more efficient methods to train Air Traffic Controllers and technicians.  FAA wants to find out what advanced technologies and learning technologies such as open standards, extensible markup language (XML), and content repositories can be easily implemented for web-based, virtual world, and voice recognition technology, are available to increase the efficiency of our controller and technical development programs for both new and recurrent training. The goal is to reduce the cost, increase proficiency- and performance-based training while improving instructor-to-student accessibility ratios. This will deliver increased performance and proficiency during all phases of training, provide virtual remote access.  It will also provide students with technical feedback on their simulation performance.  Any application should be easy to modify by the agency.  The technologies and tools will be applied to the following areas of training: 	Air traffic control, basic radar air traffic techniques such as acquiring targets, vectoring, separating aircraft by altitude and distance, identifying aircraft characteristics and impact to operations, transferring communications, effect of weather on the air traffic environment, new equipment training repair, and inter- and intra-facility coordination.  	Technical operations alignment and improving any aspect in the entire spectrum of air traffic practical training will be considered.  The lessons/scenarios should be scalable to different levels of complexity and be easily tailored to specific air traffic facilities and airspace.  	Scenario-based outcomes that must, at a minimum, comply with standards established by Air Traffic Control, to include minimum separation, radio procedures and phraseology, wake turbulence application, and other restrictions.  The FAA is looking for sources that can use e-learning, e-coaching, collaborative development, and interactive simulations to increase the efficiency of our air traffic training programs at both terminal and en route work sites.  The following tools and applications are included in this search:	Methods for creating a curriculum architecture that allows for competency traceability to job tasks and training to measurable proficiency. This would support a framework for the structure and planning of training for the technical workforce that will bring together job task analysis data, curricula, and instructional guidelines.	A front end job and task analysis tool and database that tracks training content to specific job tasks and objectives.  This tool should have the ability to integrate with a training content management system to facilitate the creation and maintenance of training content that is aligned with tasks and objectives.	Leased bundled services at a defined annual fee that provide web-based training content authoring and management, automatic software maintenance, support, and upgrades, customization and integration services, and unlimited licensing for developers and learners.  The learning content management system should meet all of the previously defined requirements of the stakeholder community.  2.  Incumbent Contractor (Not applicable)

<SUBJECT>System to Provide NERC CIP Compliant Access to Substation Data
<SOLNBR>DE-RFI-WN04125
<RESPDATE>041511
<CONTACT>Eric M. Samuels, Contract Specialist, Phone 9163534537, Fax 9169851933, Email samuels@wapa.gov
<DESC>Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Sierra Nevada Region (SNR) is interested in obtaining information from potential suppliers regarding systems that are designed to facilitate its compliance with current and future NERC Cyber Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards, while securely maintaining access to substation data for its maintenance engineers. The following sections list some of the areas of consideration that the Region is considering for possible implementation.
<p>Limited, Secure, Logical Access with CIP Compliance Capability. Provide information regarding system design that allows a single point of access at the substation that is designed to be secure and meet CIP Compliance. Describe the extent and method by which the system can be expanded to serve many serial and network devices in the substation while maintaining a single point of access. Describe what CIP requirements are met with your implementation, and how your implementation meets those requirements.</p>
<p>Features designed to meet CIP Compliance by taking advantage of existing security infrastructure. Western desires to take advantage of existing workflows and processes for its other systems to meet CIPS compliance for its Substation data. What features does your product provide that allows for centralized management of access that is synchronized to the existing corporate infrastructure (eg. LDAP, Active Directory)? What features facilitate the management associated with authorizing and tracking access to all resources in the system? Describe features of your product that have been implemented to meet the CIP stringent requirements for password change management at the IED level. Please describe features that provide for access control and rights for different levels of users at the IED level. Where and how are these features implemented in your system?</p>
<p>Management of IED Configurations. Please provide detailed information regarding features implemented to manage IED configurations. Of particular interest are features that support IED configuration version control, change tracking, detection of actual configuration changes (whether authorized or not), and reporting on configuration changes. Please describe comparison and reporting tools that facilitate the ability for a user to quickly determine and report on detailed changes that have taken place in the configuration of particular devices. Please provide a list of devices or file formats for which you support configuration management with the aforementioned features.</p>
<p>Non-operational Data (eg. Fault Data) - Automatic Machine-to-Machine Data Collection. Western SNR is interested in implementations that minimize remote transparent access to substation devices for the purpose of obtaining fault data. What features do your product support that provide for automatic data collection and machine-to-machine transfer of fault data from the substation to a secure control center location for later access by maintenance engineers? Please include details regarding:<br />1. What formats of fault data you directly support? Of particular interest, discuss your support of specific GE relays, Areva relays, and Schweitzer devices. <br />2. Please describe the mechanisms that are used to initiate and implement transfer of the data, where the data is stored along the way, and how the user may access it at its destination location.<br />3. Please describe the industry standard formats that you support such as COMTRADE. <br />4. How is the conversion from proprietary formats to standard formats accomplished? Is the conversion automatic?</p>
<p>Built in VPN Support. Describe built in VPN support that you provide between your system's components. Describe how your system could be used to support CIP electronic security perimeters.</p>
<p>Remote Transparent Access. While Western SNR has an interest in limiting the need for engineers to access remote devices, it also recognizes that it may not be able to completely avoid the need for Remote Transparent Access. Remote Transparent Access requires the implementation of some type of tunneling system through which data passes between the user on one end and the IED device on the other. Please answer the following questions regarding the tunneling system:<br />1. What mechanisms do you use to insure that the tunneling system is secure?<br />2. For Remote Transparent Access, what parts of your system do you use to control access and to document activity for CIPS compliance?<br />3. Tunnels should be completely transparent. Is there any restriction on characters for any of the tunnels that would prevent that tunnel from providing complete transparency?<br /><br />Alarm, Status, and Analog Data Support. Describe the support you provide for returning relay alarm data to a secure location for access by engineers. Similarly, describe how your system makes this data available to other systems such as SCADA systems using standard protocols such as DNP. What proprietary protocols do you support for communication with IEDs for this type of data. Of particular interest are GE, Areva, and Schweitzer relays.</p>
<p>Availability of Log Data. Failure of a system containing log data may mean that the log data is not available for CIP compliance auditors. What features in your system make it possible to avoid the loss of log data in the event of failure or compromise of system components?</p>
<p>Disaster Recovery. While disaster recovery is largely based upon the processes and procedures provide by the organization that owns the equipment, it is possible that certain features or system architecture in installed equipment may be able to facilitate disaster recovery. What features or architectural solutions does your system support to facilitate disaster recovery?<br /><br />Background:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for analysis and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. This RFI is being used to identify and gather data. The Western Area Power Administration (Western), Sierra Nevada Regional Office is requesting information to provide NERC-CIP Compliant Access to Substation Data.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain GIS Units as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.phpIn addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC>ADMINISTRATIVE:The last maintenance cycle created Amendment #1 with changes to the editable text of C03, D06 (specifically D.6.2), and Exhibit H.  This amendment adds the original language back in for these sections.  See Amendment #1 for a complete list of the changes from the maintenance cycle.GIS RESOURCE CATEGORY FORM and OPTIONAL INTERNET RATE:The form does not include a rate for internet.  If you intend to offer a price for this optional item, you are required to submit an attachment (a price sheet). The attachment shall be added to the offer when you attach your vendor company information form and completed resource category forms.  Include vendor name, solicitation number, and price for internet on the price sheet attachment. Do not include any personally identifiable information (PII).  Attachments with PII will be requested in negotiations to remove the PII.  As part of the evaluation process I will be validating with offerors that have attached a price sheet for internet that what they are offering meets the requirements.  If your offer is accepted, you will receive an award, the agreement will immediately be issued a modification that includes the awarded price for the optional internet.  For more information on PII, reference the following document:  OMB Memo 06-19 which can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/2006.htmlTHIS SOLICITATION HAS RECEIVED A PROTEST TO THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS:This is to notify you that a protest has been filed with the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) in connection with Solicitation number AG-024B-S-11-7001 for GIS Units.  The Case number for this protest is 10-869C.  You may obtain a redacted copy of the complaint from the COFC and file a Motion to Intervene directly with the COFC.  The Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims are available at http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/court_info/rules_20100111_v8.pdf.  The Forest Service will establish Blanket Purchase Agreements in connection with this solicitation upon the resolution of the protest.  The COFC is currently scheduled to issue a decision on March 21, 2011.  I, therefore, request that you submit your offers per the terms of the solicitation, including any amendments, by February 7, 2011 with an acceptance period through August 5, 2011 (see Section E., clause E.1).  The Forest Service will proceed with the evaluation of the offers while the protest is pending.  Any changes to this notice will be communicated directly to you at a later time, by me.If you have any questions, please contact me, slavalley@fs.fed.us or 406-329-3680, or Teri Sabin at tasabin@fs.fed.us or 715-479-2724.QUESTION/CLARIFICATION ON GISS QUALIFICATIONS:As stated in D.3.1 - if you offer a price for the GISS position, and if that position is ordered with the unit, all GIS Specialists shall meet the requirements of the solicitation.  The requirements are very similar to what was there in the previous solicitation, except we are requiring a fully qualified GISS position if ordered.All task books for vendors/contractors are to be initiated by the employer or a qualified training provider.  Most Geographic Areas have a Forest Service or agency person that works with vendors and/or contractors on training-related issues.  I would suggest you discuss local practices with that person on the initiation of a task book if you intend on offering a price for the GISS position.  There are several items in the task book that can be completed in a classroom or simulation, there are also several that have to be completed on an incident managed under the Incident Command System, and several that have to be completed on a wildfire incident.  Please refer to the task book for more information.  Here is a link to the task book at the NWCG:   http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/taskbook/planning/pms-311-77.pdfSPECIFICATIONSD.2.1.1, number 11 and 12  disregard any dimension requirements for awning and windows.

<DESC>In 2001 the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at the National Institutes of Health convened an exploratory workshop at which considerable agreement emerged among government, industry, and academic stakeholders that a national dietary supplement label database was needed in order to support and enhance research activities. Dietary supplements marketed and sold in the United States are regulated more like foods than like drugs and there is no extensively-populated research database of dietary supplement labels available to serve the needs of scientists, researchers, and educators. A variety of incomplete and fragmented databases currently exist with far less functionality and far fewer data records than what is ultimately envisioned for the ODS research Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD). <br />The Office of Dietary Supplements research DSLD was developed as a prototype and successfully demonstrated, with a sample of 600 dietary supplement labels, to a panel of Federal Stakeholders in May 2009. <br />The Office of Dietary Supplements seeks, through this effort, to populate its web-based research Dietary Supplement Label Database with label data from the estimated 50,000 dietary supplements sold in the United States. <br /><br />This is a pre-solicitation notice&nbsp;for a base year plus four optional years, &nbsp;fixed price contract.&nbsp; A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 days from this notice.&nbsp; Interested parties should view the FEDBIZOPPS for postings.

<p>Design Submission Requirements<br />If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p>Program and Design Criteria<br />The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. Overarching Objective of the Competition<br />Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B. Overall Site Boundaries<br />The design competition's overall study area is President's Park South which is part of the National Park System and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. The study area is President's Park South as bounded by State Place, Hamilton Place, and the South Fence of the White House grounds to the north, 15th Street to the east, Constitution Avenue to the south, and 17th Street to the west. The competition's focus is the environment along E Street between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and the environment along the perimeter of President's Park South, with the necessity of incorporating more durable security features for the White House and its grounds while preserving President's Park South's historic landscape and vistas.<br />A more detailed program describing the program elements, White House security objectives, and performance criteria for the redesign of E Street will be available to the finalists.</p>

<p>Design Submission Requirements<br />If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p>Program and Design Criteria<br />The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. Overarching Objective of the Competition<br />Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B. Overall Site Boundaries<br />The design competition's overall study area is President's Park South which is part of the National Park System and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. The study area is President's Park South as bounded by State Place, Hamilton Place, and the South Fence of the White House grounds to the north, 15th Street to the east, Constitution Avenue to the south, and 17th Street to the west. The competition's focus is the environment along E Street between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and the environment along the perimeter of President's Park South, with the necessity of incorporating more durable security features for the White House and its grounds while preserving President's Park South's historic landscape and vistas.<br />A more detailed program describing the program elements, White House security objectives, and performance criteria for the redesign of E Street will be available to the finalists.</p>
<p>Resources &amp; Background Material Available to the Competitors<br />Background materials will be made available through NCPC's FTP site.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Assured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Request for Information<br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406 <br />
<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding an end-to-end Ka- and Ku- commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) capability for Department of Defense theater specific operations.&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong>COMSATCOM is an essential communications component for in-theater operations.&nbsp; The USCENTCOM theater of operations incurs the greatest amount of COMSATCOM usage, using Ku-band service on more than 20 different commercial communications satellites, mostly through the use of base period leases (typically single-year) with additional option year leases.&nbsp; Leases range from small fractions of a Transponded Equivalent (TPE) to multiple TPEs with an aggregate sustained demand of over 5 GHz of service and more than 1,200 terminal links/accesses.</p>
<p>With the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 President's Budget Request, the DoD is preparing for an FY12-FY14 investment to acquire long-term satellite communications services in the Ka- and Ku-bands, preferably on a single satellite, to meet COCOM theater demand, directing as many future users and migrating as many existing users as possible from Ku to Ka-band.&nbsp; (Per Appendix A, Ground Tactical demand is envisioned migrating to Ka-band whereas AISR Demand will remain at Ku-band.)&nbsp; The investment includes both the space segment and associated terminals.&nbsp; Initially, the DoD goal is to reduce costs for COMSATCOM capability in the CENTCOM theater of operations.&nbsp; In the future, DoD requires the flexibility of moving these services to other theaters of operation as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates? Describe the functions and staffing of any NOC used for operations of comparable commercial systems.<br /><strong>T12.</strong>What are the information assurance features or characteristics of your service (e.g., TT&amp;C link encryption, network controls)? How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation. From what other contracts or sources can these terminals be procured?<br /><br /><strong>Schedule<br />S1.</strong>The desired date from service activation is 31 December 2014; describe your plan to meet this schedule. What is the necessary contract award date to accomplish this? Ensure service test and checkout prior to Government acceptance of the service is included in your schedule.<br /><strong>S2.</strong>Describe the timeline for terminal and user equipment contract award to delivery and installation of equipment.</p>

Solicitation No.: VA-101-11-RP-0087
Response to Questions 
Amendment #2

1.	In reviewing the pre-solicitation, I did not see any reference to the inclusion of a fire protection engineer as part of the minimum key personnel.  Can you clarify if the VA will require this for the solicitation?

The solicitation requested provided a list with the "minimum" key personnel.  Also, the solicitation asked for additional personnel for other disciplines.  Thus, it is up to the contractor to decide to add Fire Protection to the Key personnel or Additional personnel list; regardless the contractor must identify all disciplines necessary for the project. 

2.	What is the program for the new medical research facility? 

The proposed disciplines for the programs are described in the synopsis and scope of the solicitation.

3.	What is the breakdown between lab space, administrative space and/or any other programmatic elements in the new facility?

Building 12 Replacement - 51% of estimated construction cost, Buildings 1, 6, 8 Seismic Retrofit and Parking Structure - 49% of estimated construction cost

4.	What type of research will be housed in the new facility? 

The proposed disciplines for the programs are described in the synopsis and scope of the solicitation.

5.	What is the overall budget for this project? 

The estimated construction cost range is over $100 million.

6.	Will this project be phased?

All construction for this project must be completed before October 2016 and the contractor must develop a realistic project schedule to support the deadline.

7.	Will you host a pre-solicitation meeting and jobsite walk?

A solicitation meeting and site walk will not be held before the submittal date.  

8.	What is the average completion time for this A&E Design phase?

Construction Documents is scheduled to be awarded before the end of August 2012.

9.	What is the expected time for the down-select from the SF330s for this specific solicitation?

The expected time is approximately May 2011.

10.	I'm writing to inquire whether there will be a Pre-Submittal meeting for this project at the VAMC in San Francisco?

A solicitation meeting and site walk will not be held before the submittal date.  

11.	Should we submit Form 330 Parts I & II ONLY, for the entire A/E team, or should we include a separate narrative responding to the selection criteria outlined in the RFQ (personnel, relevant experience, management plan, sustainability, past performance, etc.). I assume if we are not allowed to submit additional material, this would be covered in 330 Section H (additional information).

Please complete Form 330 Parts I & II and a narrative responding to the selection criteria in the Solicitation.

12.	Is the (12) point font minimum applicable to the Form 330s? We typically fill out these form in (10) point font.

Please use (12) point font minimum for both the Form 330 and narrative response.

13.	Does the (100) page page limit apply to everything, cover-to-cover (table of contents, cover letter, small business subcontracting plan, SOQ/330s)? Does a double-sided page count as one or two pages?

100 Page Limit:
Includes the cover letter, proposal letter, tabs, dividers, letter of transmission, front and back covers, appendices, attachments, enclosures, index, table of contents, pictures, reference letters, charts, graphs, maps, flowcharts, schedules, models, additional information, etc.(i.e. total submission quantity).

Double-sided page with the aforementioned information on both sides counts as two pages.

14.	Small Business Subcontracting Goals: Do self-certified small businesses count towards the goals? Specifically, SBs that are self-certified SB, SDB and WOSB? We work with many small businesses that are self-certified with the SBA/CCA but not Section 8(a) certified. In addition, some of the SDB firms we work with were previously certified but their exit date has passed. It is my understanding that self-certification has been acceptable for most federally funded projects.
 
Yes, Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Small Business - can be Self-Certified, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Business - must be registered and Small Disadvantaged Business Section 8(a) - must be certified 

15.	Can you advise us as to the proportion of construction cost that is estimated to be required for the new lab replacement of building 12,,, versus the remainder of the 3 buildings to be renovated?  (Or the estimated dollar amount for each building.)

Building 12 Replacement - 51% of estimated construction cost, Buildings 1, 6, 8 Seismic Retrofit and Parking Structure - 49% of estimated construction cost. 
?

16.	Can you give us an idea of a possible schedule for the project?  When would programming start?  Concepts?  SD?

All construction for this project must be completed before October 2016 and the contractor must develop a realistic project schedule to support the deadline.

17.	What will be the representation on the selection committee from various groups-VASF Administration vs Users, Mare Island VA staff, DC VA staff, etc?

VA can not disclose this source selection information.

18.	Can you describe the intention of the requested Personnel Management Plan and Firm's Partnering Plan referenced in the Management Plan criteria? Are these formal documents with templates?

The Personnel Management Plan and Firm's Partnering Plan are part of the selection criteria.
These documents are to be prepared as part of the response and the format is at the contractor's discretion.

19.	Can you provide any information about the anticipated schedule for this project, at a minimum when services might begin, and when occupancy is desired to be achieved?
All construction for this project must be completed before October 2016 and the contractor must develop a realistic project schedule to support the deadline.  VA estimate awarding the AE contract in September 2011.

20.	Is the scoring of the applicants developed during the short listing process averaged with the scoring from the interview process to produce a final score?

VA can not disclose this source selection information.

21.	Are any pages of the proposal excluded from the 100 page limitation? Many clients who express such a limitation exclude the front and back cover, tabs and dividers, table of contents, etc. Also, is a page printed on both sides counted as one of the 100 pages, or as two?

100 Page Limit:
Includes the cover letter, proposal letter, tabs, dividers, letter of transmission, front and back covers, appendices, attachments, enclosures, index, table of contents, pictures, reference letters, charts, graphs, maps, flowcharts, schedules, models, additional information, etc.(i.e. total submission quantity).

Double-sided page with the aforementioned information on both sides counts as two pages.

22.	Are the small business subcontracting goals expressed as a percentage of the work that the prime consultant sub-contracts to other firms or as a percentage of the overall contract including the portion executed by the prime contractor. 


23.	If a firm is a Small Business AND a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, does the amount contracted to them contribute toward meeting both goals or just one?

The amount contracted to them contributes toward meeting both goals.

24.	Can you share the make-up of the committee for the short listing phase and for the interview phase? Are they the same? 

VA can not disclose this source selection information.

25.	Will the committees include architects? Will they include Researchers or other Users of the building?

VA can not disclose this source selection information.

26.	The list of "other disciplines" that might participate in the project could be a lengthy one. Do you want the proposals to include all these disciplines, i.e. telecommunications, security, audio/visual, acoustics, vibration?  Including all these (plus maybe others) could make it hard to respond in less than 100 pages to all that is requested.

The solicitation requested provided a list with the "minimum" key personnel.  Also, the solicitation asked for additional personnel for other disciplines.  The contractor must identify all disciplines necessary for the project within the 100 page limitation. 

27.	Is there any flexibility on the requirement for no less than 12 point type? This will make the completion of the Part One Sections E, F, and G more difficult within the page limitation.

Please use (12) point font minimum for both the Form 330 and narrative response.

28.	Are there any clinics?  There language that suggests our scope may include medical planning and design.

There are no clinics.  Medical planning and design may be required for the Buildings 1, 6 and 8 Seismic Retrofit / Building 12 Replacement Construction project.  

29.	Please clarify if a fee proposal is required.  The amendment struck the language that "this was not a proposal", so now it is a proposal, but left the language that "no fees are to be provided".

Please complete Form 330 Parts I & II and a narrative responding to the selection criteria in the Solicitation.

30.	Does the project include the seismic renovations of B1, 6, 8?  Is there any info you can share that gives a sense of the intensity of scope for the seismic upgrade requirements to the 3 existing buildings.

The project includes the seismic retrofit of Buildings 1, 6 and 8.   Building 12 Replacement - 51% of estimated construction cost, Buildings 1, 6, 8 Seismic Retrofit and Parking Structure - 49% of estimated construction cost. 

31.	"Preference will be given to firms with working offices capable of performing all design work within fifty (50) miles" of each project site.
 
Specifically, what importance will this "preference" be given during the evaluation?  How would you measure "capability" in this respect?  
The location criterion is ranked fourth in order of importance.  VA can not disclose the source selection information.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>SP0600-11-R-0801
<DESC>This is the redacted justification and approval (J&amp;A) for other than full and open competition for privatization of the natural gas utility system at Fort Bragg/Pope AFB, North Carolina by the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC). In accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2688, utility privatization contracts may extend for 50 years where a determination is made that a 50-year contract is cost effective; the estimated dollar value of this 50-year contract is based on a May 2008 Government Should Cost Estimate prepared by C.H. Guernsey &amp; Co. The acquisition began as a full and open competition, but that process was unsuccessful in awarding a contract. The results of that process, and subsequent market research, provide the factual support for this action and are discussed in further detail in the J&amp;A. This action is justified under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1).
