<a href="mailto:janessa.m.schantin@nasa.gov">Janessa M Schantin</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA08BA64C (INTEGRATION OF ADVANCED CONCEPTSAND VEHICLES INTO NEXTGEN) with Sensis Corporation on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The objective is to extend the performanceperiod for four months. This contract modification is for the acquisition of refined results based upon theknowledge gained as a result of the extensive analysis performed during the contractedresearch, and to solicit consensus in the form of recommended inputs into theMulti-Agency Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) Next Generation AirTransportation System (NextGen) planning documents and portfolio analysis, andconsequently JPDO and NASA activities.	The Government intends to obtain this service tocontinue the support in several areas where the contractors support is unique and timecritical.    The extension is needed to enable the continuation of the current contract (whichresulted from a NASA Research Announcement (NRA)) in order to enhance the value of thedeliverables outlined in Task 9, Dissemination of Results, through further refinementand improvement of the results obtained.  The research and analysis conducted over thecourse of this contract has highlighted the need for updates to the planning documentsand portfolio analysis.  The extension will allow these results to be efficientlyincorporated into the JPDO NextGen planning documents and portfolio analysis.  Theseplanning documents consist of the Concept of Operations (ConOps), Integrated Work Plan(IWP) and Enterprise Architecture (EA).  Both the ConOps, IWP and portfolio analysis arecurrently being updated and this effort would be ideally timed to achieve the maximumbenefit.The current contractor has developed highly relevant data that the JPDO has identified asan important enhancement to their EA, IWP and JPE.   Task 9, has been focused on threeUser and stakeholder workshops (contract deliverables), technical papers andpresentations at professional technical conferences, and a final report (contractdeliverable).  This research data and information, to be most relevant to the JPDO, needsto be inserted and expanded upon into the JPDOs NextGen Concept of Operations (ConOps),EA and IWP.  Therefore, this extension will provide for the refinement and transfer ofresearch data and information to the JPDO for their specific needs.   The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period ofperformance for a period of four months, from January 16, 2010, through May 16, 2010. Thecurrent contractor, Sensis Corporation, is considered the only contractor that can meetthis requirement given the short period of performance for the extension.  Award toanother source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that isnot expected to be recovered through competition of the extension, or unacceptable delaysin fulfilling the agencys requirements.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified pointof contact not later than 5 PM PST on January 13, 2010. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Written questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Janessa Schantin atjanessa.m.schantin@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may beviewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Synopsis:

This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the Government. Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released. Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct Market Research to identify potential avenues / zone specification / identification for supporting the Army and Air Force customers within the Afghanistan Area of Responsibility (AOR). 

Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is an agency of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). DLA provides supply support and logistics services to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and other federal agencies (customers). The Subsistence Operations, a Directorate of DSCP, is planning to award a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) five-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract. The estimated solicitation issue is Spring 2010. The intended contract base period is anticipated to be 18 months with one 18 month option, and a final option period of 24 months. It is anticipated that there will be a ramp up period although the actual time for ramp up may be subject to change depending on Market Research findings. DSCP Subsistence Supplier Operations is seeking information with the intent to solicit and award a Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) service platform in Afghanistan. 

The SPV Program has been successfully implemented around the world. There are some Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) SPV open solicitations currently on the street. Interested vendors are encouraged to view active solicitations from other regions by visiting FedBizOps.gov. This will provide prospective offerors some idea of Contract Terms and Conditions, Statement of Work, Contract Administrative Data, Solicitation Provisions, Price Definitions, Rebates and Discounts Language, 832 requirements, Evaluation Criteria/ Past Performance and Reporting Requirements, etc. The SPV is the primary distribution channel (single distributor) for procurement and delivery of a full range of commercial and Government Furnished Material (GFM) food and beverage items in a geographical region. Customers order directly from the Prime Vendor via the Subsistence Total Ordering and Receipt Electronic System (STORES) with a scheduled delivery date (commonly referred to as Required Delivery Date (RDD). Dependent upon the specific customers, deliveries shall average 1-3 times per week to each customer, unless the customer and the prime vendor agree upon more or less frequent stops. The estimated annual dollar value is $780,000,000.00. Please note that the numbers of customers, frequency of ordering and dollar value are estimates and are subject to change. The SPV provides all Subsistence products for which it has been authorized to distribute by DSCP Subsistence (via STORES customer ordering catalogs).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Rogers Federal Office Building is located at 1961 Stout Street in the central business district of Denver, Colorado. This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values.</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).

<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration.<br />The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants' existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA's workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project's access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the courthouse are to improve energy efficiency of building by installing high-efficiency windows; upgrade building security and safety by replacing windows.</p>

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</p>
<p>The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Brooks Act Procurement, FAR Subpart 36.3, Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 36.303. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require contractor interviews/presentations at the Denver Federal Center, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically after 07/10/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan for acceptance by the Contracting Officer, at the Phase Two interviews/presentations, which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>

<DESC><p><em><strong>Rear Projection Dome Display Screen<br /></strong></em><br /><strong>Objective:<br /></strong>The objective of this procurement is to provide to pilots and to other decision makers an environment that simulates actual flight conditions in order to prototype modifications to the F-16 C/D block 30 aircraft. The Government has determined that the best way to simulate this actual environment is through the use of a spherical dome display screen to meet the specifications <strong>described</strong> in the paragraphs below. Rear projectors will display images of the world (sky, ground, buildings, etc.) on the outside of the translucent dome. The pilot and cockpit will be located within the dome.</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br />The scope of this procurement includes a pre-bid site survey, a post-award site survey, creation and installation of two spherical domes and support structure, acceptance testing, and other related documentation. The projector system is not part of this procurement.<br /><br /><strong>Dome Requirements:</strong><br />-16' - 17' inside diameter minimum, self supporting spherical dome.<br />-The entire dome display screen and any associated support pedestal must physically fit within a 15' 4" maximum height to allow for projectors at the polar cap. The room has a ceiling height of 19' 9".<br />-Dome Panels will be manufactured in small enough pieces to fit through 7'2" x 6'0" doorway.<br />-Continuous horizontal Field-Of-View (FOV) will cover 360 degrees except for a 5'8" x 6'8" opening in the rear.<br />-Continuous vertical FOV will be 90 degrees up and a minimum of 30 degrees look down. <br />-Vendor shall be responsible to arrange all tooling and fasteners needed to install the dome and fasten it safely to the floor. The floor is 5" concrete on crushed rock.<br />-The inner dome surface shall be coated to provide a gain of at least 1.0 to provide a good contrast ratio for rear projection surface.<br />-The pilot's nominal eye location is the center of the dome.<br />- The dome will require multiple portals near the floor for wiring and ventilation purposes, size, and location of portals will be determined by the vendor.<br />-The butt joint seams shall be translucent and allow for nearly uninterrupted viewing. Uninterrupted shall be defined as 1 arc-minute translucent seam width at an 8' viewing distance (essentially eye limited). These butt joints can contain no opaque components.<br />-The coating used shall provide uniform luminosity such that total variation of a uniform projection is no more than 20% or &frac14; fstop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows:

Electrical power for Vandenberg AFB is purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), and is delivered by two 70-kilovolt (kV) PG&E transmission lines. The PG&E transmission lines enter the Base near the northeast corner and extend in a southwesterly direction to the Base-owned switch station. PG&E ownership terminates at the line-conductor dead-end attachments on the Base-owned switch station structure. 
The Base owns the electrical distribution system from the connections on the PG&E lines at the switch station to the point of delivery for the end users (facilities served). The AF owned system included in this solicitation consists of overhead 70-kV-rated transmission circuits that feed 12 and 12.47-kV distribution substations.  South Base is primarily 12.47 kV.  The North Base and Main Cantonment areas are primarily 12 kV.
The switch station is a low-profile, outdoor, air-insulated substation consisting of eight 70 kV line terminations (two incoming PG&E-owned lines and six outgoing Base-owned lines) and two 10-megavolt-ampere (MVA) zigzag (grounding) transformers. The transmission-switching equipment provides control and over current protection for six outgoing, Base-owned, 70-kV transmission feeds. The North Loop using circuits NL1 and NL2 supplies Substations B, D, E, and F. The South Loop using circuits SL1 and SL2 supplies Substations C, K, and N. Substation A is radial-fed directly from the switch station through circuits TA1 and TA2.  The use of the term loop is primarily for description purposes.  Although the Base has the ability to feed from the connecting circuit, the connections between the circuits are normally open and not operated as a loop.  
The substations incorporate a conventional, outdoor, air-insulated design with either a single- or multi-sectionalized bus arrangement. One, two, or three load-tap changing (LTC) transformers are located in each substation to reduce the 70-kV circuits to 12/12.47-kV circuits terminating at the substations metal-clad switchgear. The substations metal-clad switchgear provides control and over-current protection for the 12/12.47-kV-rated circuits that exit the substation. The metal-clad switchgear is housed in a masonry-type building that offers protection from the elements and restricts access.
	Substation A is located on the Lompoc  Casmalia Road, approximately 0.5 mile north of the Main Gate. This substation serves the main industrial, MFH, and airfield areas.
	Substation B is located at New Mexico Avenue and 11th Street. This substation serves the main industrial area and the 7000 Area.
	Substation C is located on 13th Street between New Mexico Avenue and State Highway 246.  This substation serves the Penitentiary/FCI and the Re-entry Vehicles facilities.
	Substation D is located near the intersection of El Rancho Road and Curley Road. This substation serves the northwest portion of the Base, including the 1800 and 1900 Areas.
	Substation E is located near the intersection of Bishop Road and Grant Road. This substation serves the northeast portion of the Base, including the 22000 and 23000 Areas.
	Substation F is located near the intersection of Ocean View Blvd and Washington Avenue.  This substation is under construction as of early 2009 and will provide dedicated service to a new building presently under construction.
	Substation K is located on Bear Creek Road near Arguello Boulevard. This substation serves SLC-3.
	Substation M is located in Building 727 within SLC-4. It is a 12-kV switch station consisting of circuit breakers configured in a sectionalized duplex-bus arrangement. This substation provides control and over current protection for 12-kV feeders serving SLC-4.  
	Substation N is located on Coast Road, between SLC-4 and SLC-6. This substation serves as the interconnection between the South Vandenberg Power Plant, Substation M, and the Base electrical distribution system.
The 12/12.47-kV distribution system consists of both overhead and underground circuits.  The distribution system is based on a three-wire system.  At several substations the circuits exit the switchgear via underground ductbanks and transition through riser poles, where they continue as overhead lines. The underground distribution system consists of concrete ductbanks and concrete handholes and manholes that provide access points to the underground conductors.  The average burial depth of ductbanks is approximately four feet below ground.  The distribution system is constructed primarily in a radial configuration with provisions to interconnect circuits for temporary backfeed and for circuit isolation. Crosstie capabilities are accomplished via gang-operated switches on utility poles and pad-mounted three- or four-way switches as well as crosstie breakers between substations.  
The South Vandenberg Power Plant (SVPP), which is not included in this solicitation, provides a total of 15 Megawatts (MW) of backup generation capacity. The plant is normally operated in backup mode, except during launch operations at SLC-3 or SLC-4, when it is operated as the prime power source for these two launch facilities. The plant also has the capability to provide a significant portion of the electrical requirements of the Base in either a stand-alone configuration or parallel with the local utility. The plant is not normally run except during launch operations due to several factors including the redundancy/reliability of the utility supply and Base transmission system as well as the economic and environmental constraints of on-site generation.
In addition to the two 70-kV transmission lines that terminate at the switch station, PG&E also owns one 115-kV transmission line that traverses the Base in an eastwest direction along West Ocean Avenue. This is a public access area in which Santa Barbara County has joint jurisdiction with Vandenberg AFB.
Vandenberg AFB is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on its west side. Electrical components such as aerial conductors, transformers, wood poles, and pole-mounted switches located along the coastline show signs of accelerated deterioration (shorter useful life).  Corrosion appears to be accelerated by constant exposure to airborne salt and daily fog mists in several locations on Vandenberg AFB. In an attempt to reduce the rate of replacement of system components, the Base has begun the process of using alternate materials of construction that are less susceptible to corrosion, such as stainless steel for transformers, switches, and fused cut-outs in areas that are experiencing shorter useful lives for the metal clad components.   
Vandenberg SCADA
The Base has recently installed a new supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to operate substations. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) are located in cabinets at electrical power substations and the switch station. The Master Control Room for the SCADA system is located in Room 107 of Facility 11439, and contains the Central Control Unit, operators consoles, mass storage devices, and other required peripheral devices. The system uses a stand-alone fiber loop that extends approximately 44 miles. The SCADA system is included in the solicitation.  The SCADA system is not presently connected to the military network and operates as a stand alone system.  Approval for access to Room 107 for Contractor personnel shall be coordinated through the Contracting Officer. The Utilities Privatization (UP) Contractor shall provide the Government with ability to monitor the electrical system via read only access to the SCADA system. 
Geographically Separated Units
Vandenberg Village Transmitter Site
Located near the eastern military family housing complex, this site covers approximately 442 acres and has one 5,600-square-foot (SF) building.  Electrical power is supplied directly from the Vandenberg AFB distribution system via a 12.47 kV feeder originating from Substation C. The system includes a transformer and switchgear, plus overhead and underground distribution network. This feeder also supplies the Lompoc Federal Penitentiary and traverses through that site.  
Oak Mountain Annex
Located near Lompoc, CA, approximately 20 miles from the center of Vandenberg AFB, this site covers approximately 4 acres and has 10 buildings totaling approximately 18,000 SF.
	Electrical power is supplied directly from a PG&E-owned 12.47 kV line. The system includes transformers plus overhead and underground distribution networks.

The natural gas distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Southern California Gas Company (SCGC) supplies odorized natural gas to Vandenberg AFB at three separate delivery point locations. The delivery points are as follows:
	One delivery point is located near the North Gate, close to the intersection of State Highway 1 and California Boulevard. This delivery point supplies the Main Base and the north side of the East Housing through separate feeds and pressure regulation and metering equipment. The SCGC supply line for this delivery point is located along State Highway 1. 
	The second delivery point is located adjacent to Lompoc Road and West Ocean Avenue on South Base. The SCGC supply line for this connection is located along West Ocean Avenue. 
	The third delivery point supplies natural gas to the Vandenberg AFB Tracking Station located in the middle northern portion of the Base. 
The Air Force generally owns the natural gas distribution system infrastructure downstream of these delivery points.  
Main Base
The Main Base receives 50 psig natural gas from the SCGC-owned regulator and meter station located near the North Gate (intersection of State Highway 1 and California Boulevard).  
If required, the Main Base may also be supplied from the South Base natural gas distribution system through a 4-inch steel pipe emanating from South Base and traversing along 13th Street where it interconnects to a Base-owned pressure regulator and metering station located on 13th Street southeast of Facility 6510.  
The Main Base natural gas infrastructure supplies the privatized West Housing Area through a Base-owned regulator and metering station located north of California Boulevard and west of the North Gate in the vicinity where Ocean View Boulevard (West Housing) ends in a cul-de-sac. With the exception of a few lines that service Base facilities that are located within the West Housing Area, the distribution system infrastructure downstream from this point is owned by the Housing Privatization Contractor (reference contract exhibits between HP Contractor and Air Force for additional information).
Natural gas is distributed to service connections on the Main Base through main and service lateral piping of various sizes.  Replacement of the original metallic piping with polyethylene (PE) piping began in the 1980s.  Replacement continued with a significant project in the mid 1990s that replaced most of the remaining steel piping.  Exceptions include relatively small segments that remain steel at 50 psig and the 375 psig, 4-inch steel piping, which interconnects Main Base and South Base.  The 375 psig system includes 255 linear feet that is enclosed in a 24-inch steel casing jack and bored beneath Ocean Avenue (which separates Main Base and South Base). 
The average burial depth of the natural gas piping is three feet. PE pipe was generally installed with warning tape and tracer wires; however, PE piping may have also been installed without tracer wire. It is estimated that 2 percent of the natural gas piping lies beneath 6-inch asphalt pavements on the Main Base. 
Corrosion protection for the 375 psig steel natural gas piping is provided by a sacrificial anode cathodic protection system installed with the piping in the mid 1990s. The 50-psig steel piping is protected by a combination of impressed current and sacrificial anode cathodic protection systems. Over the years, some areas and facilities served with steel piping have become electrically isolated and are no longer cathodically protected. The extent of these isolated areas is not known.
Main Base  Facilities Supplied from within West Housing Area
There are facilities located on the Main Base that are supplied natural gas from the West Housing Area natural gas distribution system, which was privatized to the Housing Developer. These facilities include the 14000 Area located west of Utah Road, north of Wyoming Avenue, and south of Juniper Street; the 16100 Area located west and north of Summersill Avenue, east of Utah Road, and south of Montana Avenue; and the Base Chapel (Facility 16200), which is located east of Summersill Avenue and west of Noble Road. Natural gas distribution infrastructure downstream from the points is included in this Utilities Privatization Solicitation with the exception of the old Base Chapel, whose demarcation point with the Housing Developer results in no inventory upstream of standard PODs that can be privatized.  In other words, the HP Contractor is required to provide delivery service to the old Chapel. Reference Section J2.12.2.3, Utility System Points of Demarcation, and Table 11. 
Natural gas is distributed at 40 psig to approximately seven service connections in these areas through approximately 3,800 linear feet of main and service lateral piping that range in size from 1.25 inches to 3 inches. The infrastructure in this area consists of steel piping and valves originally constructed in 1942 and the late 1950s to 1970. The average burial depth of the natural gas piping is 3 feet. It is estimated that 2 percent of the natural gas piping lies beneath 6-inch asphalt pavements in these areas. Corrosion protection for the steel natural gas infrastructure is provided by impressed current cathodic protection systems.
East Housing
East Housing is supplied from a single delivery point, an SCGC-owned regulator and meter station located near the North Gate (intersection of State Highway 1 and California Boulevard). At this delivery point gas is reduced to 40 psig for delivery throughout the East Housing Areas northern system (the southern distribution system has been abandoned and is not included in this UP Solicitation).  The northern distribution system supplies natural gas to facilities north of Sumac Street and ends in the vicinity of Mulberry Drive and Walnut Street.
The housing units in the East Housing area have been demolished to the foundation and the natural gas piping capped at the housing unit slabs.  Currently, the East Housing natural gas distribution system supplies natural gas to facilities associated with the Vandenberg Middle School, Los Padres Elementary School, and Martha Negas School; however, the entire natural gas distribution system (mains, sub mains and laterals) up to the housing unit slabs remains active. The Offeror shall propose a Transition Period project to sever the natural gas distribution infrastructure, including removal of aboveground infrastructure and abandonment in place of existing belowground natural gas infrastructure (see 2.10 Specific Transition Requirements).   
South Base
The South Base receives 375 psig natural gas from the SCGC-owned meter station located on South Base on Lompoc Road near West Ocean Avenue. 
The South Vandenberg Power Plant (SVPP - Facility 525), which is at the southernmost end of the natural gas distribution system, requires natural gas to be distributed at 375 psig. To accommodate other end users the natural gas distribution system utilizes nine district regulator stations to reduce distribution pressure to 50 psig. The district regulator stations provide initial pressure regulation (375 psig to 50 psig) for one facility to multiple facilities served by one district regulator station and the facility-specific service regulators further reduce the pressure from 50 psi to building service pressure.  SVPP includes a SCGC-owned metering station to track the consumption of natural gas at that facility.
The South Base natural gas distribution system is interconnected with the Main Base natural gas distribution system through a 4-inch steel piping main at the intersection of Arguello Boulevard and Clark Street. From there, piping traverses north onto Main Base along 13th Street, where it interconnects to the Base-owned pressure regulator and metering station located on 13th Street southeast of Facility 6510.
Natural gas is distributed at 375 psig on South Base through approximately 55,300 linear feet of steel main piping ranging in size from 0.75 inch to 8 inches. Most of this piping is 8 inches; the other smaller diameter piping supplies the district regulator stations or the South Base/Main Base interconnection piping. The 8-inch 375-psig natural gas distribution system on South Base was originally constructed in 1988 along with sacrificial anode cathodic protection systems. The 4-inch 375-psig piping, valves and the sacrificial anode cathodic protection system that interconnects the South Base and Main Base systems was constructed in the mid 1990s.  
The average burial depth of the natural gas piping is 3 feet. PE pipe was generally installed with warning tape and tracer wires; however, PE piping may have also been installed without tracer wire. It is estimated that 2 percent of the natural gas piping lies beneath 6-inch asphalt pavements on South Base. 
A sacrificial anode cathodic protection system and 56 test stations installed with the buried 375-psig steel piping in 1988 provide corrosion protection for the piping. The sacrificial cathodic protection system for this piping is nearing the end of its expected useful life and the aboveground test stations/gas-line markers show signs of severe atmospheric corrosion.    
Due to the accelerated atmospheric corrosion rate of aboveground steel piping and valves in proximity to the coastline on South Base, Vandenberg AFB has begun replacing the aboveground steel piping and valves associated with the district regulator stations with stainless steel-type construction. Currently, the piping, valves, strainers, and fittings for five of the nine district regulator stations have been replaced with stainless steel-type construction. These include the district regulator stations at or near Facilities 836, 840, 870, and 753 and SLC-4. The pressure regulators and pressure-relief valves at the district regulator stations are constructed with typical component materials (ductile-iron body and aluminum or cast-iron diaphragm cases for the regulators and steel or cast iron for the pressure relief valves) and have not been replaced. The district regulator stations at or near Facilities 848 and 852 and both district regulator stations at SLC-3 are constructed of painted steel piping and valves and similar types of regulators and pressure-relief valves and show signs of corrosion.
The 8-inch 375-psig natural gas main piping has limited isolation valves to isolate portions of the system. To conduct repair work on the system the entire 8-inch line has to be isolated and the system purged. This limited ability to isolate the system for repairs could adversely affect equipment supporting the Space Launch Complexes. The Government recognizes this project as an immediate need associated with the system. 
Vandenberg AFB Tracking Station
The Vandenberg AFB Tracking Station natural gas distribution system receives natural gas from the SCGC-owned regulator and meter station located in the middle northern portion of the Base. The natural gas from this delivery point is reduced to 50 psig for delivery to the facilities served. 
The natural gas distribution system supplies two service connections through approximately 6,800 linear feet of main and service lateral piping ranging in size from 1 inch to 2 inches. The infrastructure in this area was constructed in the 1990s and consists of steel and PE and an impressed current cathodic protection system. The average burial depth of the natural gas piping is 3 feet. It is estimated that 1 percent of the natural gas piping lies beneath 6-inch asphalt pavements.


Vandenberg Village Transmitter Site
Located near the eastern military family housing complex, this site covers approximately 442 acres and has one 5,600-square-foot (SF) building.  This site has no natural gas components. 
Oak Mountain Annex
Located near Lompoc, CA, approximately 20 miles from the center of Vandenberg AFB, this site covers approximately 4 acres and has 10 buildings totaling approximately 18,000 SF.  This site has no natural gas components.

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The water distribution system at Vandenberg AFB serves the entire Base population, portions of the fire protection system, and the U.S. Lompoc Federal Penitentiary. Vandenberg AFB has two sources of water, the Central Coast Water Authoritys (CCWA) California State Project Water and water from the Bases wells. The CCWA is intended to be the Bases primary source of water. The Bases wells are used to supplement the CCWA source during periods that exceed CCWA supply or when CCWA supply is unavailable. CCWA is not a firm water supply as CCWA supply can be taken out of service for any 30-day period with minimum notice.
Water delivered to Vandenberg AFB originates from the California Aqueduct system and is treated by the CCWA in the 43-million-gallon-per-day (MGD) Polonio Pass Water Treatment Plant. The water is transmitted to Vandenberg AFB via a 140-mile pipeline that also serves as a supply line to numerous retail domestic water distributors in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. This supply pipeline is known as the Coastal Branch Aqueduct (CBA). The Vandenberg AFB water distribution system connects to the 39-inch CBA near Firefighter Road and State Route 1. The CBA is not a part of the Vandenberg AFB water system, but it does cross the base through an easement granted by the Air Force. The pipeline enters Vandenberg AFB near the town of Casmalia and traverses the Base in a southerly direction, exiting east of the main gate area. A Base pipeline conveys water from the CBA connection to a blending station located at the Base Main Reservoir.
During those periods when the Base uses well water to supplement the CCWA water, the well water is treated and blended with CCWA water at the San Antonio Water plant (Plant 2). The San Antonio Water Plant is the Bases main water treatment facility. At the plant, the water is treated with sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and is stored in a 2-million-gallon (MG) aboveground steel reservoir. From the reservoir, the water is pumped into the two 4-MG underground concrete reservoirs. Additional treatment provided at the reservoir area includes sodium silico-fluoride solution (fluoridation of water), sodium hypochlorite (disinfection), and aqueous ammonia. From the reservoir area, water flows by gravity to the Main Cantonment distribution system and to other areas of the Base through five distribution pump stations and pressure-regulating valves. 
Additional disinfection treatment is located at the main water reservoirs (Facilities 20211 and 20222) on Firefighter Road, where the incoming state water is analyzed and chloramines levels are boosted. To maintain chloramine levels, Vandenberg AFB also has a remote treatment plant at Facility 700 on South Base for disinfection. Additional treatment also occurs at some of the remote storage tanks.
At least one month each year, the CCWA service is not available.  During that time, the Base switches to well water.  The well water is chlorinated to reduce the need for flushing water from dead-end segments of the line.  The CCWA service uses chloramines.  As a result, flushing is required throughout the system when switching from one source to another.  
Currently, a perennial service contract is in place to manage water quality. The contractor monitors water quality at various locations, conducts flushing operations, and produces drinking water quality reports. The UP Contractor will be required to perform these operations. Because of the great size of Vandenberg AFB, the distances between facilities, and the length of pipe runs in the water distribution system, Vandenberg AFB has encountered difficulty in maintaining potable water standards (chlorine residuals). These great distances have made it economically infeasible to loop water mains in the past. Consequently, it is necessary to regularly flush sections of water lines so that water quality standards are maintained.  Although this is wasteful of water resources, it is a necessary aspect of the existing configuration.  Flushing is also necessary to control nitration and it is necessary to switch once a year from chloramine residual to using a free chlorine residual for at least thirty-days. One week before flushing, coordination and concurrence with the Government is required to assure sufficient water is available and to conserve water.  Additional data regarding flushing requirements can be found in the Water Quality Action Plan, available in the technical library.  Vandenberg AFB has discussed in the past the possibility of installing automatic flushing devices at approximately 21 various locations on the installation to reduce the need for manual flushing but this project is not presently designed or funded. 
One elevated tank, the main reservoirs, and the water pump stations provide system pressure. The system water pressure during normal operations ranges from 51 to 114 pounds per square inch (psi) based on fire hydrant flow tests conducted as part of the water distribution model (Source: Basewide Water Distribution Model, Vandenberg AFB, California, Penfield and Smith, 30 August 2006). 

Water Wells
There are four on-Base groundwater wells located on the Main Base, completed in the San Antonio Groundwater Basin, which are used for the groundwater supply. The wells were constructed in the 1960s (Wells 4 and 5, upgraded in 1996), the 1970s (Well 6, upgraded in 1999), and the 1990s (Well 7A). The capacity of these wells ranges from 850 gallons per minute (gpm) to 1,250 gpm. The wells are excluded from this solicitation. The POD is as defined in J3.12.2.3 Utility System Points of Demarcation, Table 11, Unique Points of Demarcation. Water from the wells is treated first at the wellfield by one of two degasifiers, which are included in this solicitation, to remove hydrogen sulfide. Each degasifier provides treatment for two wells. From the degasifiers, the well water gravity flows to the San Antonio Water Plant. 
Three additional wells, Wells 1, 2, and 3, are not in operation and are not included in this solicitation. These wells are located on South Base and are not interconnected with the potable water system.

Pump Stations
Vandenberg AFB has one main pump station (Facility 22313) and five distribution pump stations: Canyon Pump Station (Facility 23150), East Housing Pump Station (Facility 30080), North Vandenberg Pump Station (Facility 1991), Tank A Pump Station (Facility 686), and Tank B Pump Station (Facility 621). The capacities of the pump stations range from 10 to 100 horsepower and from 125 to 500 gpm. Each of the five distribution pump stations is equipped with two pumps and no emergency generator. The main pump station (located at the San Antonio Plant), Facility 22313, is equipped with four pumps capable of 1,600 gpm. 
The five distribution pump stations transfer water between the water distribution mains and the storage tanks. Each of the stations is equipped with automatic controls that operate the pump as needed. There are numerous fire pumps located throughout Vandenberg AFB but they are excluded from this potable water system package. The Air Force will retain ownership and operation and maintenance responsibility for these pumps.

Tanks
The water-demand requirements for Vandenberg AFB are supported by water tanks and reservoirs that provide operational flexibility during the peak-flow-demand periods, equalize system pressure, and provide emergency storage capacity. The potable distribution system utilizes 15 tanks and reservoirs for storage. The tanks are steel, with the exception of the two 4-MG underground storage tanks that are constructed of concrete. Chemical treatment of Base water occurs at the San Antonio Water Plant (Tank 22313) and the Main Reservoir (Tanks 20221 and 20222), and at remote tanks far removed from the initial storage points, such as Tanks 700 and 462. 
All the metal tanks currently in use, except for the three small tanks, are reported to be protected with cathodic protection systems. However, the 2004 Tank Inspection Reports reported the cathodic protection system in Tank 22313 was in need of replacement and there were no cathodic protection systems for Tanks 462 and 700. In addition, the condition of the cathodic protection system for Tank 23211 was unknown. The 2005 Cathodic Protection Annual Performance Booklet reported readings below the recommended standards for Tanks 700 and 22313, and no information was available for Tanks 31770 and 23211. The 2006 Cathodic Protection Annual Performance Booklet also reported that the cathodic protection system for Tank 23211 had been repaired.
Vandenberg AFB has other water tanks that are not included in this solicitation. Tank 15003 (an elevated steel tank in the Trailer Park) and Tank 1505 (an elevated steel tank in Munitions Area) were disconnected from the water distribution system. Other tanks identified on the system maps and in Real Property records and not specified herein are also not included in this solicitation and are either not connected to distribution system or they only support fire systems.

Water Distribution Mains
Distribution mains and laterals in the Base water system range in size from 0.75 to 36 inches in diameter. The construction of the Vandenberg AFB water distribution system began in 1940. However, the Base closed in 1946. In the 1950s, the Base was re-activated and the temporary 1940s infrastructure was replaced with a permanent system. The system has periodically been upgraded and expanded to handle increased system demands and to support new missions. As the Base moved from an Army installation to its Ballistic Space and Aeronautical missions during the 1950s to the 1970s, new SLCs were constructed outside the Main Cantonment area and supporting facilities were constructed within and around the cantonment area.
The existing water distribution system includes two backbone pipelines. These 36-inch backbones, running from the main reservoir facility to the Main Cantonment area, are critical for providing capacity for water transmission and fire-flow demands. The 36-inch pipelines from the two 4-MG storage tanks are interconnected with other smaller mains, forming a gridiron distribution system that serves the Bases facilities. The water distribution system includes metered and un-metered service connections and several air release structures. There is an 8-inch pipeline connecting North Vandenberg and South Base.
The general buried depth of the potable water pipe is in the range of 3 to 5 feet with an average depth of 4 feet. Multiple isolation valves are located throughout the water distribution system to facilitate isolation of water line segments for repairs. Fire hydrants function to provide water for fighting fires and are also used occasionally to flush the potable water system. Cast-iron mains are protected from corrosion with sacrificial cathodic protection systems. Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has been installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects.
Generally, replacement buried water lines may be installed using open-cut trenching techniques. An estimated 2 percent of the distribution system piping is beneath paved surfaces.
A corrosion control study of Vandenberg AFB was conducted in June 1980, Corrosion Analysis Report Vandenberg AFB, California, by Air Force Engineering and Services Center. The report indicated that soil resistivity varied throughout the Base. The report stated, Most soil resistivities were below 10,000 ohm-cm and many dropped below 5,000 ohm per centimeter (ohm-cm), indicating the soil is generally corrosive to buried aluminum, steel and, to some extent, cast iron. The report characterized the Vandenberg AFBs soils as having a high corrosion risk to metal materials. Corrosion of underground metal utilities is prevalent at Vandenberg. This is due to very low resistivity soil throughout the base and large amounts of underground metal construction. A majority of earlier underground metal utilities have failed. Exceptions are the cathodically protected steel gas distribution piping and much of the 1940 vintage unprotected cast iron water mains. Corrosion failures on these two utilities are also occurring but not excessively. Based on the reported information, the soil has a high corrosion potential for unprotected metal piping with gradual effect in cast-iron piping.

Vandenberg Village Transmitter Site
Water is supplied by a 2,150 linear feet 1.5-inch line from the Base owned meter at the connection to the Vandenberg Village Community Services District water system to the facility served. The water is supplied by the Vandenberg Village Community Services District water system and the Base is billed for what is used by the transmitter site.  
Oak Mountain Annex	
This site has its own well, tank, and water distribution network.  The water distribution system serving the Oak Mountain annex facilities is considered a non-potable system.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

The Vandenberg AFB wastewater collection systems consist of laterals, mains, manholes, cleanouts, lift stations, generators, and holding basins. The wastewater collection system infrastructure, which was constructed predominantly in the 1940s and early 1950s, has periodically been upgraded and expanded. The system being privatized includes trunk, main, and lateral sewer lines, 15 lift stations (11 on the Main Base and 4 on South Base), approximately 651 manholes, one treatment pond, one holding basin, and one package WWTP. Lift stations within buildings, within the housing areas, and within several of the launch sites are maintained by others and are not included in this solicitation. In addition, septic tanks and associated drain fields are not included in this solicitation. 
The wastewater collected in the Main Base gravity system flows from Vandenberg AFB to the City of Lompoc Regional Wastewater Reclamation Plant (LRWRP) through a sewer main constructed in 1978. The lines diameter varies from 12 to 24 inches (depending upon the line slope), and includes three siphons. A lined holding pond was also constructed along the line near the Base boundary to temporarily store peak flows from the Base that exceed the capacity of the line or to reduce peak flows to the LRWRP. When the peak flows recede, the wastewater in the pond is drained back into the line to flow to the LRWRP. Wastewater flow is measured with a 14-inch sonic flowmeter owned by LRWRP, installed within a vault, which is located near the Lompoc wastewater treatment plant. The permitted monthly average discharge from Vandenberg AFB to the City of Lompoc is 1.3 million gallons per day (MGD).
Since the 1990s, as lines were replaced and new lines added, the replacement piping has been either cured-in-place liners, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and the new manholes have been constructed of pre-cast concrete. PVC is the preferred material for pipeline replacements. Depth of burial for wastewater collection mains ranges from 4 to approximately 15 feet, with an average of approximately 8 feet. The average depth of buried building service laterals is approximately 6 feet. An estimated 2 percent of the collection piping is beneath paved surfaces. Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has been installed with non-metallic replacement pipe or new construction pipe since the 1990s. The original vitrified clay pipe was not installed with tracer wire or marking tape.
Within the Main Base, there are ten wastewater lift stations used in the Bases collection system, which include lift station (LS) 1450, LS 1618, LS 1628, LS 1755, LS 1758, LS 1978, LS 1987, LS 2526, LS 3250, and LS 9340. LS 1758, LS 1987, and LS 3250 are equipped with emergency generators. LS 1758 is also equipped with an emergency holding basin. LS 1450, LS 1618, LS 1628, LS 1755, LS 1978, and LS 1987 transfer wastewater from a small group of buildings to a septic system. LS 3250 collects wastewater generated near Building 3000, and then pumps it via 6 inch and 4-inch force mains to the Main Base gravity collection system. LS 1758 collects wastewater generated near the Flightline; and pumps it via a 6-inch force main to the Main Base gravity collection system. LS 2526 and LS 9340 collect wastewater from a single facility or small group of facilities and discharge to the Main Base gravity collection system. Lift stations are not monitored by a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.
South Base
South Base is located south of Main Base with West Ocean Avenue dividing the two portions of the Base.  South Base consists of four main areas with wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure. The four areas are identified as: South Base Area, SLC-3, SLC-4, and SLC-6. All four areas have independent collection and treatment systems. 
The South Base Area collection and treatment system is excluded from this solicitation. The collection systems within the actual launch complexes at SLC-3, SLC-4, and SLC-6 are excluded from this solicitation.  However, facilities in the vicinity of the launch complexes that are not within the restricted area of the complex but have lift stations pumping to septic tank systems are included. An example is the facilities surrounding SLC-6 that utilize two lift stations to transfer wastewater to the single septic tank serving all facilities at and around SLC-6.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
FOR A THIRD PARTY BILL PAYMENT SERVICE


The Center for Transportation Management (QMCC) of the General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to seek information and sources for a third party bill payment service provider.  

QMCCs goal is to become the provider of choice for all transportation needs across the Federal Government and create a contemporary world-class portfolio program that consistently meets the needs of the Federal community.  

GSA periodically procures rates from Transportation Service Provider (TSPs) and makes them available in a transportation management solution (TMS) to all federal civilian agencies for their shipping needs. The end customers are Federal agencies and users from customer agencies order the shipments. QMCC seeks to identify third party bill payment service providers (3PPS) with the ability to process and pay invoices received from TSPs for Household Goods (CHAMP) and Freight Management Program (FMP) shipments in addition to receiving payments from the customers for their shipments. GSA is also considering including small parcel shipments in the payment process and prospective vendors are encouraged to offer solutions for these shipments. The service should be supported by an Invoice Presentment and Payment solution that can integrate with our TMS solution and customer financial systems. 

GSA charges a transaction fee, also known as the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF) to all TSPs for providing transportation services to federal civilian agencies. The IFF is computed as a percentage of the shipment charges, which varies for freight and household goods shipments. The 3PPS shall have the capability to collect the IFF from the TSPs and remit to GSA.  

There are approximately 270 approved CHAMP TSPs and 1600 TSPs for the FMP. The anticipated number of shipments for household goods and freight shipments combined are 100,000 per year. 

GSA recently issued an RFI for a TMS solution for market research purpose. The RFI can be found at FBO at and provides information on the TMS solution:
https://www.fbo.gov/index?&s=opportunity&mode=form&id=c5112dfad68f18a51cb443defac15869&tab=core&tabmode=list

QMCC is focusing on the following key principles:
	Streamlined Invoice-To-Pay process
	Efficient collection of IFF
	Performance of the overall service
	Cost effectiveness
	Information security
	Scalability
	Ease of Use
	Implementation schedule

The solution shall provide the following:

1.	Customizable with GSA standards such as the GSA logo, banner, and useful links, FAQs, which can be found on www.gsa.gov.
2.	Support additional government specific master data attributes such as business size and type (example: 8(a), small business, minority owned etc.)
3.	Support any hierarchical structure of the government agencies and the underlying bureaus and associated users that would utilize the service.

<DESC>This draft Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is issued by the US Department of Energy to solicit input on the Energy Innovation Hub - Modeling and Simulation for Nuclear Reactors program.  The draft FOA outlines the planned scope of the Hub program, evaluation criteria, terms and conditions, cost-share requirements, and the process for awarding a cooperative agreement to establish and operate the Modeling and Simulation Hub.
This draft FOA provides an opportunity for public review and comment.    Input from interested parties will be considered in the development of the final FOA, which DOE expects to release in January 2010.  Accordingly, to best ensure consideration, parties wishing to provide comment/input are encouraged to do so as soon as possible, but no later than January 11, 2009.   Comments/inputs should be sent via email to minorkl@id.doe.gov.   
NOTE:  This document is not a funding opportunity announcement, but is a draft FOA only issued for public information and comment.  Any resultant final FOA will be issued on the Grants.gov website at http://www.grants.gov/ 
The purpose of the Energy Innovation Hubs will be to assemble the most talented scientists and technologists to focus intense research and development efforts on the critical areas listed above.  The Hubs are designed to accelerate the current state-of-the art energy science and technology toward their fundamental limits and support high-risk, high-reward research projects that produce revolutionary changes in how we produce and use energy.  Ideally, each Hub will have a central location housing many investigators, who will likely span multiple disciplines.  Each Hub may be led by universities, private for-profit or non-profit firms, or government laboratories.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE DARPA-SN-10-17, PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE DEEP SEA OPERATIONS PROGRAM (DSOP)
<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Deep Sea Operations (DSOP) program on January 19, 2010 from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM in Arlington, Virginia at the Executive Office Center located at: Strategic Analysis, 4075 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22203 in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-10-20 (expected to be released prior to the Proposers' Day Conference). The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Deep Sea Operations program; and to promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for one-on-one exchanges with the government team.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />Air and space were once unused operational domains which today are central to our nation's security and economic vitality. As technology drives peer nation parity in traditional domains, the deep ocean offers an unused operational space to achieve significant gains in strategic capability. DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for the Deep Sea Operations with the program goal to introduce surveillance that operates at extreme ocean depths to detect quiet submarines overhead. Proposers will be asked to identify system concepts and technologies for which they will perform trade studies to help shape future development. Proposers may also propose data collection to validate key assumptions central to the success of their solutions.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: <br />All participants must pre-register for the conference no later than 4:00 PM EST January 15, 2010. Please include the subject "DSOP Proposers' Day" in all submissions and correspondence. Details on the conference, including registration information and directions to the facility are available for download at the BAA information website http://www.solers.com/BAAinfo-reg/dsop/. There is no registration fee for attendance.</p>
<p>A portion of the Proposer Day event will be classified. Participants who wish to attend during the classified portion must have at least an active DoD SECRET clearance and must have their Security Office submit a Visit Request Form no later than 4:00 PM EST January 15, 2010. Visit requests should be sent to Michael Quantrille, Program Security Representative, via email to michael.quantrille.ctr@darpa.mil, fax to 703-248-1910 or JPAS to DDAAUS4.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day is voluntary. Attendance is not required to propose to the BAA for this program. Due to space limitations at the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.</p>
<p>Additionally, attendees who would like to meet with the program manager and government team for one-on-one discussions may register to do so through a link on the BAA information website. Eight 20 minute sessions will be allocated during the afternoon, which will be made available in the order with which proposers register, until all allocations are filled. Separately, nine (9) 20 minute sessions will available at DARPA the following day, January 20, 2010.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 5 START CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-S5-06-04. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT. The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #19 is to obligate $90,000.00 for a Targeted Brownfields Assessment (TBA) of multiple South Fairmount Properties, City of Cincinnati, County of Hamilton, State of Ohio. The period of performance will be from December 30, 2009 through May 31, 2010. Requirements for TO #19 include the following: 1) attending meeting(s) and conference calls with Local, City, State and EPA representatives; 2) preparing a site-specific Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and Health &amp; Safety Plan (HASP); 3) completing an area-wide American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) compliant Phase I investigation of the South Fairmount Neighborhood; 4) conducting Focused Phase I sampling activities as necessary; 5) preparing a Phase I Report; 6) preparing the Property Profile Form (PPF) or entering site-specific information into EPA Assessment, Cleanup and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES) Database; 7) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA" or "the Act") contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intention to award a sole source FOLLOW - ON contract to Smith Root Incorporated (SRI) of Vancouver, Washington, for the purpose of acquiring additional supply and install services, whereby, SRI will supply</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN"> <span>and install their uniquely designed and patented pulse generators to enable the proper operation of the Dispersal Barrier IIB electronic systems. </span></span>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Under this District's previously issued sole source contract to SRI, the company supplied and installed the pulse generator devices, which are customized and are considered the only ones of its type capable of meeting the demands of the Dispersal Barrier technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN">All intellectual property rights pertaining to these unique components belong exclusively to SRI, including, but not limited to copyrights, patents and trademarks which are expressly reserved to SRI and covered by their </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Patent 4750451. Further, SRI has research, proprietary arts, trade secret technology not open to the public that they use in fish barrier designs and components therein; thereby </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN">making SRI the only source capable of satisfying the government's requirements of this proposed contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To further add, the assembly (customization) and installation of these key components will require the use of SRI's uniquely skilled and highly reliable labor force, already having the intimate knowledge of the Barrier's mechanical and electronic systems. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Under their previously awarded contract, SRI performed at an optimal level, as its labor force demonstrated its capabilities to properly assemble their patented components, and remain on schedule to meet the critical timeframes imposed by the tight overall project schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, it is deemed necessary to obtain the supply and install services from the original source (SRI) to continue an agile operation of the Barrier without disruption and to avoid a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered by way of competition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In addition, the government cannot afford any delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements since the Barrier itself protects the ecosystem from two species of Asian carp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The massive and voracious fish, which can grow to 4 feet long and weigh 100 pounds, are known for their ability to leap up to 8 feet out of the water as motor boats speed by, injuring fishermen. Scientists fear that the fish, which can eat the equivalent of 40 percent of their body weight every day, could damage the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, which is the largest fresh water system on earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Under the proposed contract, all work including system testing will be complete September 30, 2010 (includes time for delivery and install of the components).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract will result in a firm-fixed price supply contract. </span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. 2010-N-11869 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 29. This procurement has been set aside 100 percent for Small Businesses. The associated NAICS code and small business size standard are 541618 and $7 Million. The total period of performance under this contract shall be 12 months from date of award.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to extend its use of standard vocabulary in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) implementation specifications under development reporting beyond healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) data from healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Phase IV of the CDA for HAI reporting project will extend technical guidance for reporting additional NHSN event types, previously developed in Phases I, II and III of the project, to a new set of reporting requirements. These reporting requirements include vocabulary needed to convey HAI data in accordance with (1) NHSN specifications, (2) healthcare informatics and information technology standards, and (3) Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) requirements.</p>
<p>Phase IV of the CDA for HAI reporting project will provide a standards-based solution that enables healthcare facilities that use commercial infection control surveillance applications, electronic health record systems (EHRs) and electronic medication administration record systems (eMAR) to report Pharmacy, Dialysis and Blood Safety event data to NHSN without manually enter into NHSN.</p>
<p>CDC goals are 1) to provide additional options for submitting data to NHSN, the CDA work products shall be maintained and updated as needed; and 2) to use healthcare industry standard vocabulary for collecting HAI data from disparate infection control surveillance systems. To achieve CDC's goal of using healthcare industry standard vocabulary for collecting data from disparate software applications the following objectives must be accomplished:</p>
<p>&bull; Dialysis Event Form; Dialysis Denominator Form; (2 forms)<br />o Outpatient Dialysis Survey<br />o Dialysis Event<br />&bull; Antimicrobial Use and Resistance (AUR) and Pharmacy Data - Monthly Report Form (1 form)<br />o Antimicrobial Use and Resistance (AUR)<br />Pharmacy Data - Monthly Report Form<br />&bull; Biovigilance event forms (4 forms)<br />o Hemovigilance Incident <br />o Blood Product Incident Summary Data<br />o Monthly Reporting Denominators<br />o Adverse Reaction</p>
<p>Thus, CDC seeks services of a qualified contractor to provide the following tasks and sub-tasks:</p>
<p>1. Develop Implementation Guide additions including clinical statement design<br />2. Produce complete sample instance document (XML)<br />3. Develop generate-narrative transform<br />4. Develop Schematron and test files<br />5. Modify display transform<br />6. Incorporate vocabulary into PHIN VADS<br />7. Attend Spring and Fall HL7 WGM (travel expenses and hours for 1 person)<br />8. Migrate templates into data element database</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-37.  This action is set-aside for small businesses, NAICS 332312, Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  Note that non-manufacturer small businesses must offer the product of a small business to qualify for the set-aside.  The National Park Service (NPS) encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror or offerors whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.  We reserve the right to cancel this solicitation.
BACKGROUND: The sectional barge will be used in conjunction with the Stehekin Erosion Control Program on Lake Chelan at the north end of the lake, within the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The barge's main function will be to transport building materials, including but not limited to rock, gravel, sand, conventional building materials, tools and supplies, and large woody debris washing out into Lake Chelan from the Stehekin River, using a knuckleboom crane mounted on the barge deck and fitted with hydraulic butt grapples to load and unload. The barge will be moored outside and exposed year-round to the elements. The barge will not be self- powered and will require a vessel, not included in this procurement package, to move it from location to location. Offeror shall provide that each section of barge be fitted with an industry-standard rake as barge will be beached along the shoreline at regular intervals during normal usage (see below). Upon request, NPS will provide photographs of similar barge and crane that we own and operate on Ross Lake for reference purposes (send an e-mail to sarah_welch@nps.gov; note that prices paid for those items are irrelevant to the current solicitation due to the elapsed time on prior purchase and will not be disclosed).  Maps and information about the park are at www.nps.gov/lach .
REQUIREMENTS: ITEM 1, BARGE - Due to budget constraints, NPS prefers offers of reconditioned or used sectional barges which conform to the specifications below, although new barges will be considered. Offered products shall meet our minimum performance specifications to be considered.  You may suggest and price additional features as options; for example, including fixtures for towing, mooring, and anchoring is acceptable.  However, offers for barges that exceed the maximum dimensions stated in the solicitation (20' W x 50' L, including rakes) will not be considered.(1) Barge (comprised of two equally-sized sections pinned together) with industry-standard rakes to address the conditions and requirements identified herein. The desired configuration is for a square (box) stern and sloped (raked) bow for the full width of each section.  If the rake is a separate item to be attached to the barge sections, rather than part of the overall design and fabrication, then the attachment system should follow that described in specification (3), below.  It is preferred that the system holding barge sections together and the system holding rakes to sections should be the same.  Rake surface should match the surface of the barge sections in condition and elevation. (2) Overall barge measurement shall not exceed 50' in length including rakes and width between 16' and 20' (no wider than 20', with 20' preferred).  Assembled barge dimensions will be 20'x50'x4'-5'unless otherwise approved and accepted.  (3) It is preferred that oval access hatches to below-deck barge cavities be installed, preferably located around the perimeter of the barge sections centered at approximately 20" from edges.(4) The barge shall be designed to haul loads of 40-50 net tons @ 65% submergence. (5) The barge shall be designed to remain stable and seaworthy in high winds, and on seas of up to 5 ft.  (6) The barge shall have a draft of 10"-12" light draft and 36"-40" maximum draft.  (7) The barge, new or used, shall be sandblasted and painted with appropriate marine-rated, industry standard undercoat and finish coat, a marine grey preferable, including a non-skid deck coating, prior to delivery.  (8) The hull of the barge shall be constructed of 1/4" steel, minimum. Aluminum is not preferred even if it meets our load capacity specs. The nature of the rocky shoreline where we moor makes aluminum a less favorable option.(9) The barge shall have a continuous extruded rubber rub rail (4.5"w x 3.75"h) on port, starboard and stern centered at 10" below the top of deck surface. (10) The barge shall have 12" tie-down cleats installed port and starboard, bow and stern (centered on 10" from edge and 3' from bow and stern) on the assembled barge and two intermediary cleats, evenly spaced, between the bow and stern cleats on both port and starboard sides. All cleats shall be through-bolted with " to " stiffener plates. (11) Barge sections shall be pinned together with full-length pins and fully secured prior to launch. A vertical " minimum pin assembly through welded tubing and/or locking channels on the barge sections at approximately every 5' is one acceptable method. Other pinning options will be considered upon submittal.  (12) The deck of the barge shall be reinforced with a design approved by a marine architect to accommodate the installation of the Hiab H111.33 knuckleboom crane (see Item 2). NPS prefers a crane mount location approximately 6'-10' back from the bow and to the starboard side of the center seam, as close to the seam as possible, between the barge sections. This request is subject to marine engineer approval.
ITEM 2, INSTALL CRANE ON BARGEThe barge vendor shall provide basic plans with offer, subject to review by NPS, for installation of knuckleboom crane on the deck.  After award, barge vendor shall provide an engineer-stamped drawing for exact deck reinforcement and installation.  After engineered plans are approved by NPS, install crane on reinforced barge deck.  Note that installation shall be by persons experienced in this type of work.  The crane has been purchased by NPS and is staged in Ohio.  NPS will arrange and pay for the transport of the crane to the barge vendor or mutually-agreed-upon subcontractor-installer.  NPS will have the crane appurtenances (reels, hoses, hydraulic controls, grapples, power pack, etc.) delivered separately to NPS, and NPS will install these items after acceptance of barge.
Crane details:  It is a Hiab H111-3.3 (aka Hiab XS 111 B-3 CLX) knuckleboom crane with "L"-type marine base, rated to lift 2,000 lbs. at 32' distance.  Weight is 2870 lbs (not including oil and hose reel); height (folded) is 85"; width (folded) is 90".  Detailed specifications can be viewed at http://www.hiab.us/default.asp?productGroupId=13974&productId=25302&docId=21508&tab=downloads
ITEM 3, DELIVERY AND ASSEMBLYBarge vendor shall deliver, assemble, and launch sectional barge, with crane installed, on Lake Chelan at Old Mill Park, Manson, WA.  Delivery shall occur within 60 days of contract award.  Note earliest possible delivery timeframe (e.g. 30 days after award) in your offer.  FOB point is Destination.  Lake Chelan is a reservoir whose elevation varies with the seasons.  Current lake level can be monitored at http://www.chelanpud.org/lake-chelan-lake-levels.cfm.  
Old Mill Park is a public boat launch administered by Chelan County, located approximately eight miles north of Chelan on the southeast shore of Lake Chelan. Vendor shall be responsible for assessing suitability of this delivery site. The launch site includes three slips with cement ramps going down into the lake.  The center slip is the widest (24') and is defined by floating sidewalk-sized cement docks on either side anchored by pilings spaced approximately 6-8' apart; vendor should launch in this 24'-wide slip. The length of the docks exceeds 50', and is likely close to 80'.  On the outside edge of a neighboring slip, there is a log boom with pilings spaced along its length, which is overall 75' - 100'.  The launch site also has an ample, flat parking area for assembly of barge. Upon assembly, launch is in a straight line within 100' of assembly area. Vendor may choose to assemble barge on land or in the water.  Photos are available at http://mansonparks.com/references.html.  Additional photos can be e-mailed upon request (send an e-mail to sarah_welch@nps.gov).  Driving directions are at http://www.chelanpud.org/driving-directions-to-old-mill-park.html.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 5:<br /></strong></span>You released some additional information this morning regarding the switching requirement for Room 236. Your reply was "It is expected that the matrix switcher and touch screen system will handle all incoming source feeds and disburse them with a single feed to each LCD monitor." The original document states that the four monitors will display "CATV, CCTV and approximately 8 PC feeds". It does not say that the projector should handle CATV or CCTV feeds. If literally all feeds must go through the matrix switcher per the reply, that changes the design in a significant way. I wanted to clarify whether or not this was intended, and whether I should change my design to meet this new information?<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer 5:</span></strong><br />For room 236, basically everything will be routed through the matrix switcher which is controlled by the touch panel controller. All feeds should be routed through the matrix switcher which in turn can route any input to any output device, monitors and projector. The Government will be responsible for supplying the CCTV and CATV source to the switcher. All other cables from the PCs are provided by the contractor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this posting. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HHM402-10-R-0013 is issued as a Request for Proposals. The NAICS code is 541519 other computer related services and the business size standard for this NAICS is $25 million. This procurement is a total small business set aside. All prospective offerors must have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bnp.gov. The period of performance for each IDIQ Contract will be from date of award for 12 months with four option periods of 12 months each.
<p>This requirement is for two Areas of Expertise:<br />Area of Expertise 1: Support desk/customer support operations by TS/SCI personnel located in the DC metro area with occasional travel for training at a Government facility; and <br />Area of Expertise 2: Completion of technical architecture implementation and provision of systems technical operations and maintenance support by TS/SCI personnel located in the DC metro area at a Government facility.</p>
<p>The Virginia Contracting Activity intends to award one or two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts. An offeror may propose for one Area of Expertise or for both Areas. Should one offeror be the successful awardee for both Areas, the Government will award one IDIQ Contract. The Government intends to award one or two IDIQ contracts to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Task orders will then be issued for the specific projects submitted by customer agencies as fixed price and/or fixed price with additional performance incentives; task orders will not be competed.</p>
<p>Proposals and questions are to be emailed to Mishelle Miller at <a href="mailto:Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil">Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil</a>. Only emailed questions will be accepted. Questions must be emailed prior to&nbsp;1 PM Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2010; questions and their answers will be posted on this website as soon as possible.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The following constitute amendment 1 of Solicitation HHM402-10-R-0013. These are questions and answers. The deadline for questions remains as 1 PM Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2010 and deadline for proposals is 1 PM EST on Tuesday, January 26, 2010. Please email all correspondence to Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil (note correction on email address).</p>
<p>Q1. I noticed that the file has a size of 0.00 Kb, and when attempting to select the link, the system returned an error message.<br />A1. The link titled Unnamed File under Appendix of Documents from Statement of Objectives does not point to any document. The link cannot be removed.</p>
<p>Q2. The link for section I returns "page not found".<br />A2. Sorry, I failed to upload correctly the Solicitation Form through Section I under the package Solicitation. I have uploaded a new package and the link there is for the Solicitation Form through Section I.</p>
<p>Q3. I was not able to find SF1449 with block #8 listing the "offer due date/local time".<br />A3. I did not upload the Solicitation Form, SF1449, correctly. That is now fixed; I have uploaded a new package and the link there is for the Solicitation Form through Section I.</p>
<p>Q4. The fedbizopps announcement states "...Proposals and questions are to be emailed to Mishelle Miller at Mishelle.Miller@Government.mil. Only emailed questions will be accepted. Questions must be emailed prior to 1 PM Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2010; questions and their answers will be posted on this website as soon as possible..."<br />A4. Email all questions, proposals, etc. to Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil. The proposal deadline is on the new package, Solicitation Form through Section I, and the deadline is also on the right side of the www.fbo.gov notice under General Information in the section titled Response Date. The deadline for proposals is January 26, 2010 at 1:00 pm Eastern.</p>
<p>Q5. Volume V Security - missing from all documents reviewed was a statement of what is expected to be addressed in Volume V.<br />A5. Look at the package entitled Solicitation and the link for Solicitation Section L. Section L, L 5.3.3. Contents of Volume IV: Security should instead state Contents of Volume V Security. The contents of Volume V Security are "The Offeror shall provide the CAGE codes for all Facility clearances."</p>
<p>Q6. What is the proposal due date?<br />A6. The proposal deadline is on the new package, Solicitation Form through Section I, and the deadline is also on the right side of the www.fbo.gov notice under General Information in the section titled Response Date. The deadline for proposals is January 26, 2010 at 1:00 pm Eastern.</p>
<p>Q7. Is this project considered a new requirement? If this project is not considered a new requirement? Who is/are the incumbent? What is/are the contract numbers?<br />A7. This is a new requirement. I am not providing information about other contractors or contract numbers in relationship to HHM402-10-R-0013.</p>
<p><br />Q8. Regarding Solicitation # HHM402-10-R-0013, this is a request for an Introduction and Capability Meeting with the activity Program Manager and the Contract Officer supporting this Contract Management System Support Desk and Technical Architecture requirement. In addition, this is a request for HUBZone set-aside classification for this requirement/solicitation.<br />A8. Thank you for your interest; this requirement is 100% set aside for a small business and will not be set aside for HUBZone. Any request for a meeting with the technical experts is inappropriate since the Solicitation has been posted.</p>

<DESC><p>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is seeking interested contractors to provide continuation of services to contract no. FA8819-04-C-0002 for Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Block 10 Space Vehicle (SV) storage in a launch ready state, launch processing, risk reduction, and on-orbit checkout of the SBSS Block 10 system. The Government intends to use the responses to this synopsis to assess whether or not a sole source contract is appropriate.</p>
<p>Contract no. FA8819-04-C-0002 was awarded to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems acting in capacity as the integrating contractor for a Boeing Company subcontract team. The Boeing team was responsible for the development, delivery, launch and operations of the space vehicle and ground elements. Due to delays in providing Government furnished launch services, the scheduled launch date of October 2009 was not met. FA8819-04-C-0002 will now be completed and a separate contract will be established for the activities described below. The Boeing team was responsible for the development, delivery, launch and operations of the space vehicle and ground elements and possesses highly specialized system knowledge to meet government requirements in a timely and cost efficient manner.</p>
<p>The scope of work will include: storage, maintenance and transportation of the SBSS Block 10 space vehicle; maintenance of the SBSS ground segment and engineering support hardware and software; resolving parts obsolescence and shelf-life issues; launch call-up and preparation activities, including processing at a designated payload processing facility; launch and early orbit support; on-orbit commissioning, checkout and calibration; and studies to support risk reduction and mission assurance.

<DESC>From the Project Manager,<BR>Robotic Systems Joint Project Office<BR>Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems<BR><BR>1.  Robotics Systems.  The Project Manager, Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RS JPO) located at the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) in Warren, Michigan, currently manages several robotic Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platforms fielded within the United States and overseas in support of our Army and Marine Corps forces in performing unmanned reconnaissance, surveillance, and route and area clearance missions of IEDs and land mines.  Each platform has its own Operator Control Unit (OCU) that provides control of a UGV and its unique mission capability payloads.  The RS JPO is seeking substantive information to contribute to the development of interoperability standards for UGVs.  The RS JPO is pursuing an iterative, progressive (crawl, walk, run) approach to standards determination.  This information could form the basis of UGV interoperability profiles that would be used in future UGV acquisition performance requirements.       <BR><BR>2.  Request For Information.  This request is for technical information and considerations for developing UGV non-proprietary interoperability standards that will provide for commonality of interfaces, third party payload modularity, interchangeability of payloads between OEMs, common control and control interfaces based on open standards and open interfaces resulting in competitive Unmanned Ground Vehicle procurements.  <BR><BR>The RS JPO requests that all interested companies furnish specific responses to the questions provided and complete a company information questionnaire.  Additionally, respondents should provide any supplemental information or commercial literature describing the technical considerations for interoperability addressing the logical (JAUS), physical, transport, and common data link interfaces.   The Government does NOT wish to obtain proprietary or otherwise protected documents as a result of this Request For Information.  Further, all documents received will not be shared, released or disclosed outside of the U.S. Government.  The Government may return such data or documents submitted that have proprietary or protected markings.  The Government is under no obligation of any kind to proceed with an acquisition in anyway related to this market survey.  This survey is not intended as a solicitation of any proposal.<BR><BR>Please note that the RS JPO is planning a future engagement with industry in 3rd Quarter 2010 to further expand and develop this initial effort, announcement posting is anticipated for 2nd Quarter 2010. <BR><BR>3.

What business type is your company (large, small, small-disadvantaged, women-owned or 8(a)?  Is your company located in a labor surplus or HUB-zone (See FAR Part 19 Small Business Programs)?<BR><BR>2.  What products/services does your company primarily manufacture or provide?  Please list the names and/or identifying numbers of the specific systems you are describing in response to this questionnaire.<BR><BR>3.  How long has your company been in business?<BR><BR>4.  List your North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.<BR><BR>C.  Interoperability Standards:<BR><BR>1.  What expertise does your company have and approximately how many years of related experience in the following areas? (check all that apply):<BR><BR>	Sealed Electrical connectors  _____ years experience<BR>	Electrical Shielding  _____ years experience<BR>	Manipulators/ end effectors  _____ years experience<BR>	Mechanical connections  (Locating features & Quick Release)  _____ years experience<BR>	Radios  _____ years experience<BR>	Software Architecture  _____ years experience<BR>	Video Encoding  _____ years experience<BR>	Payloads  _____ years experience<BR>	Network Architecture  _____ years experience<BR>	JAUS Messaging  _____ years experience<BR>	Robot Platforms  _____ years experience<BR><BR>2.  Would your company be interested in partnering with the RS JPO and participating in development of open interoperability profiles for UGVs?  If so, select the areas of expertise that your company can support:  <BR><BR>	Electrical connectors <BR>	Manipulators<BR>	Mechanical connections<BR>	Radios <BR>	Software Architecture <BR>	Video Encoding <BR>	Payloads <BR>	Network Architecture <BR>	JAUS Messaging <BR>	Robot Platforms <BR><BR>3.   What experience does your company have with the development of Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems  (JAUS) in accordance with the SAE JAUS standard to facilitate UxV interoperability?  In what areas was additional specification, adaptation, or extension necessary in order to achieve the desired goal?<BR><BR>4.  Department of Defense has mandated that all UGVs use JAUS as the logical architecture for controlling UGVs.  What is the best way to implement JAUS in producing a fully open and interoperable system?<BR><BR>D.  Physical Architecture/Interfaces?<BR><BR>1.   One of the challenges with achieving interoperability is to ensure that various payloads and accessories can interface with the base UGV platform.  This will require open standards that the UGV vendors and payload vendors can implement. Based on these challenges, and in light of supporting interoperability standards for UGVs, what is your companys recommendation on the following and why?<BR>"	Electrical connector standards<BR>"	Wire harness requirements (gauge, shielding, etc&)<BR>"	Data standards to and from payloads<BR>"	Data standards between internal components<BR>"	Power provided / required by payloads<BR>"	Data processing locations (processor on UGV or payload)<BR>"	Mechanical attachments (mounting)<BR>"	Grouping of payloads into families<BR><BR>2.  There already exist several payloads and accessories for UGVs. How does (or would) your company propose interfacing with these items? <BR>"	Internally developed items<BR>"	Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) items<BR>"	Externally developed items (outside vendors)<BR>"	Legacy items (existing items)<BR><BR>3.  There are several challenges and opportunities in developing a physical interoperability standard. What are your companys concerns in developing open, non-proprietary interoperability standards with regards to these areas?<BR>"	Electrical connections<BR>"	Physical connections<BR>"	Power requirements<BR>"	Data requirements<BR>"	Data processing<BR>"	Requirements from the UGV vendors<BR>"	Requirements from the Payload vendors<BR>"	Multiple standards for various payloads<BR><BR>E.  Modularity/Common Control?<BR><BR>1.  One of the benefits of having a defined interoperability profile is that modular components can be used to increase the number of mission profiles a UGV can perform. Based on component modularity, what are your companys comments on the following items?<BR>"	Warfighter Machine Interface (WMI) software updates for various payloads<BR>"	Open standards to allow other vendors to develop payloads<BR>"	Plug and play capability<BR>"	Inhibit zones for various modules<BR>"	End effecter usage<BR><BR>2.  Using non-proprietary common control architecture would allow the warfighter to control multiple robotic assets with one controller. What are your companys recommendations on the development of a common control standard with regard to the following aspects?<BR>"	Central Processing Unit (CPU)<BR>"	Radio<BR>"	WMI  input devices<BR>"	WMI  Display devices<BR>"	Display formats<BR>"	Software<BR>"	Controller payloads<BR>"	User defined setups<BR>"	Wireless handheld controllers<BR>"	Power<BR>"	Electrical connectors<BR>"	Prioritization of message<BR><BR>E.  Data Link, Common Data Link?<BR><BR>1.  Describe your company's experience in sharing and distributing UxV data to include battlespace objects, video, and metadata across unmanned ground and air vehicles from within a common operator control unit.<BR><BR>2.  The challenges with radio frequency Data Link include maximizing Line of Sight (LOS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) range, limited bandwidth, high data rates, latency, interference rejection/ avoidance, low power consumption, small size, etc.  Based on these challenges and in light of supporting an interoperability standard for UGVs what is your companys recommendation on the following and why?<BR>"	Video Encoding<BR>"	Interleave<BR>"	Modulation<BR>"	Channelization of video, platform control, payload control, diagnostics and status<BR>"	Antennas<BR>"	Adaptive power control<BR>"	Bandwidth throttling/ Adaptive Coding and Modulation <BR>"	Power <BR>"	User Datagram Protocol vs Transport Control Protocol (TCP)<BR>"	Prioritization of messages<BR><BR>END OF QUESTIONS<BR><BR>NOTE:  The Government is not asking you to develop or provide drawings or develop any technical data in response to this RFI market survey.<BR><BR>Questions regarding the market survey should be directed to Damon McNally, TACOM Contracting, at damon.mcnally@us.army.mil or (586) 282-5185.

BLIZNYUK, CHAIRMAN, DONETSK OBLAST COUNCIL, DONETSK REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, PUSHKINA BLVD, 34, DONETSK, 83105, UKRAINE +38 062 334 20 40.</p>
<p>UKRAINE: DONETSK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IMRPOVEMENT AND EXPANSION PROJECT FEASIBILITY STUDY The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to:</p>
<p><br />1.determine the requirements for expanding/improving the airport facilities at Donetsk International Airport; <br />2.determine the viability of the latest design for a new terminal complex that the Grantee is proposing and propose two alternate schematic plans; <br />3.assess the financial feasibility of the three plans; and,<br />4.determine a financing strategy based on the use of multinational bank funds and local and private funding.</p>
<p>Donetsk Airport is the fourth largest airport in Ukraine. Donetsk Airport serves Donetsk Oblast and areas of heavily populated surrounding oblasts, so the total population of the area served by the airport is approximately six million. Donetsk Airport is the main hub of the fast-growing Ukrainian air carrier Donbassaero, and the airport also is served by other European airlines, such as Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines. The airport is owned by the Donetsk Oblast Council, which is responsible for development and upkeep of the terminal and associated facilities. The current Soviet-era passenger terminal building was built in the 1970s and does not meet current standards for international passenger facilities. Furthermore, Donetsk Airport has experienced rapid traffic growth over the last five years, with passenger traffic growing at a rate of 18% per year and aircraft movements increasing at a rate of more than 5% per year. Although airport officials report that the existing terminal is unable to effectively handle current traffic, recent projections estimate that the number of annual passengers at Donetsk Airport will increase from 650,000 in 2008 to more than one million by 2017.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $520,209 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

The system shall be capable ofsupplying auniform spray across the nozzle array with variable water content.	The waterflowrate per nozzle shall not vary more than plus or minus 3% across the nozzle array.Water passages shall not freeze whether water is or is not flowing through thespraynozzles.  Ice particle size and ice water content shall be controlled remotelyfrom thecontrol room.  This award is consistent with NASAs continuing investmentin high-risk,cutting edge technologies and is responsive to congressional directionto conductresearch on technologies where icing can occur on aircraft turbineengines as they flythrough clouds or as they sit idling on the ground during coldfoggy conditions.  Theseicing conditions can cause physical damage to the engineif the ice sheds and strikesengine hardware. The United States Federal AviationAdministration and the EuropeanAviation Safety Agency require aircraft turbine engine manufactures tocertify that theirengines can operate in these icing conditions without serious lossof power, thrust ordamage to the engine hardware as a result of ice shedding.
