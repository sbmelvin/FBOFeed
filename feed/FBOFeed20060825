<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a requirement for a specialized Consultant Review Board (CRB) to review the seismic source characterization of the Foothills fault system (FFS).  The FFS is the closest potential fault source to Folsom Dam and at low annual probabilities of exceedence may be the controlling seismic source. The CRB will provide an independent review of the seismic source characterization of the FFS that is being developed and used in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) and ground motion evaluations for Folsom Dam.  Folsom Dam and Reservoir are located on the American River, approximately 15 miles east of downtown Sacramento, California at the western edge of the Sierra Nevada Foothills.  Reclamation's Seismotectonics and Geophysics Group is revising the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and ground motion parameters for the dam as part of the Corrective Action Analyses (CAA).  As such, Reclamation has the requirement for an independent review of the seismic source characterization of the FFS to ensure Reclamation has the latest, most up-to-date, best interpretation of the available data. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13 and Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Subpart 12.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other service will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The source is comprised of: [Dr. William Lettis, William Lettis and Associates; Dr. James McCalpin, GeoHaz Consultants; Mr. Thomas Sawyer, Piedmont Geosciences; Dr. Frank H. (Bert) Swan; and Dr. Robert Youngs, Geomatrix Consultants.]  Reclamation prepared a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition to support this acquisition. Any individual or firm who believes it can provide the required services, described above, are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  However the individual or firm believing it can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above, in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered strictly for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at 303/445-6345 or e-mail at jcollins@do.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) and Tax Identification (TIN) numbers.

<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Coastal and Marine Geology Team (USGS) has a requirement for marine seismic reflection profile data offshore the western United States. WesternGeco, a major geophysical contractor based in Houston, Texas, holds large quantities of marine geophysical seismic reflection profile data acquired over the past 30 years offshore western United States within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.  These data are of diminishing commercial value, and the company has offered to transfer the data to the USGS for the cost of conversion to modern media.  These data were acquired by WesternGeco and are the sole property of that company.  Given the costs of original acquisition and processing, the re-acquisition of these data is out of the question.  Furthermore, these data have particular value because modern environmental concerns would significantly increase the cost of reacquisition.  The data consist of several components (digital files and associated paper records), and as the owner and manager of these data, WesternGeco is uniquely qualified to organize all of the components for delivery. Therefore, the Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) to WesternGeco.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish comparable data shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ; no written solicitation will be issued.  This may represent the Government's only written notice of this procurement.                                                                  This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-12, effective 04 August 2006.  For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Region 3, intends to procure on a sole-source basis with VEMCO (a division of Amirix Systems Inc.), remote electronic transmitters and receivers to perform an Asian carp telemetry project on the Illinois River. The remote ultrasonic receivers placed in the Illinois River will be part of the larger telemetry array that currently exists on the Mississippi River drainage.  Compatibility between ultrasonic transmitters and receivers is necessary to ensure that the telemetry array functions properly. In addition, the purchase of VEMCO transmitters and receivers is required so that fish tagged by the Service can be detected on the array already in place on the Mississippi River. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000. Award of a purchase order is anticipated to be approximately September 6, 2006.

This program is aimed primarily to support USAID/Afghanistan’s Infrastructure Objective to create a thriving economy led by the private sector.

The objective of this program is to provide USAID/Afghanistan a full range of technical assistance and physical support to assist the Government of Afghanistan (GoA), Afghan people, and private sector to achieve objectives that mesh with and will contribute to the achievement of four infrastructure sector objectives –   Energy and Natural Resources, Transportation, Public Buildings, and Urban Development/Water & Sanitation.  Work in all sectors will include three main components:

1)	technical assistance in the four sectors for institutional development and capacity building, including  policy formulation, planning, studies, training and operation and maintenance; 

2)	engineering, including design, reconstruction and construction of infrastructure systems and facilities; and,

3)	provision of equipment and commodities to support the operations, as well as infrastructure-related equipment and materials.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this solicitation is 935.  As such, this procurement is open to all offers from USAID Geographic Code (Source, Origin and Nationality) 935 which include all countries, except for those designated by the US Government as foreign policy restricted countries.  The current foreign policy restricted countries are as follows:  Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR.  USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

USAID anticipates awarding a single award with a period of performance for 5 years at a total estimated ceiling of up to $1.4 Billion.  The RFP is expected to be issued on November 14, 2005 and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  It will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued on the website along with the RFP.  Please check the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) periodically.

Any questions should be submitted via email to the point of contact at:  apsobangkok@usaid.gov.

EXHIBITION AND RELATED OUTREACH ACTIVITIES
                      August 14, 2006         

  BACKGROUND 

Executive Order (E.O. 13287), requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal agencies to inventory, preserve, and showcase federally-managed historic and cultural ?heritage? resources, and to foster heritage tourism in partnership with local communities and the private sector. NOAA has been working to preserve its heritage resources, from historic maps and charts to buildings and shipwrecks?and make them available through innovative programs and partnerships. To meet this requirement, NOAA requires the services of a contractor to design, construct and oversee the installation of a specialized version of the ?Treasures of NOAA?s Ark 2007? exhibit to be displayed at NOAA?s Silver Spring campus from February 5 ? 14, 2007.
A major component of the 2007 exhibition is the incorporation of the 2007 NOAA 200th Celebration of Coast and Geodetic Survey?s contribution to our nation and NOAA. Heritage Week Treasures of NOAA?s Ark will function as the kickoff keystone event for the 2007 NOAA 200th Celebration.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to extend the period of performance and increase the ceiling on FAA GSA Schedule Order DTFAWA-04-F-00080, which provides systems engineering and software support for system operations programs. This Order was placed with Flatirons Solutions Corporation of Boulder, CO. The current Order was awarded in September, 2004 with a 1-year period of performance, plus a one-year option. The FAA has begun the process of a competitive acquisition for the follow-on contract and anticipates contract award by February 12, 2007 (please reference the RFO/SIR issued July 28, 2006). This action is needed as the competitive follow-on procurement for this contract is not scheduled to be awarded until February 12, 2007, and the current Order expires November 12, 2006. Because of the necessary support provided under the current Order, an extension of the current Order plus an increase in the overall ceiling of $7,785,974 will be needed pending award of the follow-on contract.  It is also necessary to plan for an appropriate transition should the follow-on contract be awarded to a contractor other than the incumbent contractor.  Thus, the current Order would be extended from November 12, 2006 to April 12, 2007 with the ceiling increased by $3,500,000 from $7,785,974 to $11,285,974. If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer Mr. Tim Eckert no later than close of business, September 5, 2006, at the number specified in this announcement.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries for follow-on services to conduct aerial surveillance, monitoring and management of right whales in Cape Cod Bay.  The proposed contract action will continue ongoing management of habitat and conditions that impact right whales, including ship strikes.  Cape Cod Bay is the last near-shore feeding habitat that continues to support right whales along the eastern seaboard of the United States, and was designated a Federal Critical Habitat in 1994.  On average, from one-quarter to one-third of the known population are identified in Cape Cod Bay and adjacent waters each winter and spring.  The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries began a Right Whale Conservation Program in 1997 based on an intensive surveillance and monitoring program that focus on winter and spring months.  The intent of the contract is to conduct research to reduce the threats of human induced mortality attributable to vessel collisions and entanglements, and to gain a better understanding of both the spatial and temporal distribution of individually identified whales.  The statutory authority for this action is 41. U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Congressionally mandated funding has been allocated for this advancement of right whale research and protection.  The anticipated performance period is for one year from the date of award, plus two one-year option periods.  The applicable NAICS is 924120.  All responsible parties may submit an offer that will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement and installation of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) communications equipment and Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE) to allow implementation of NATO General Communications System (NGCS) Nodes at the Joint Warfare Center (JWC) in Stavanger, Norway and at the Joint Forces Training Center (JFTC) in Bydogoszcz, Poland.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use the ICB Best Value Procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid that is the best value for the money offered in accordance with the following evaluation criteria: 60% price, 30% engineering, and 10% management. 

NC3A plans to place a single contract with one contractor. No partial bidding will be allowed.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of 100,000 Euros ($127,400 USD). Should the selection and award procedure exceed 12 months from the bid closing date, firms will be requested to extend the validity of their bids and bid guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

The project is expected to be completed after 16 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC). 

The estimated value of this project will not be disclosed at this time. NC3A has determined that the disclosure of the budget information to prospective bidders may be detrimental to the execution of fair competition. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-12089-NJC. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference. 

The IFB package will contain only NATO UNCLASSIFIED material. Prospective bidders should be aware, however, that contractor personnel will be called on to work at a NATO site in conjunction with the contract and that such contractor personnel will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET.
SCOPE OF PROJECT
 
The contractor will provide communication equipment, constituting NGCS Nodes, at two NATO centers so as to integrate the centers into the NGCS. These centers are the JWC in Stavanger, Norway and the JFTC in Bydgoszcz, Poland. 

Operational Objectives

The operational objectives of the contract are as follows, for each site:

- Provision of smart connectivity through existing NATO Bandwidth Management Equipment (BME) network as part of the NGCS;

- Provision of a telephone network for local and distant telephone communication and services that is highly reconfigurable in training areas;

- Provision of packet transport connectivity mainly from local Automated Information System (AIS) infrastructure through the existing NATO Packet Transport Component (PTC) as part of the NGCS for all types of data exchange purposes

Contract Description

This contract is set up to provide communication capability at both the JWC and the JFTC sites. The work is divided, at each location, into the following five portions:

- BME and transmission will include (not exhaustive list) relocation, reconfiguration and integration of already installed BME at the JWC and JFTC in the existing NATO BME network and connection of BME to available leased transmission services interfaces acquired by NATO as part of separate contracts;

- Center Telephone Network (CTN), which will include (not exhaustive list) the provision, installation, configuration and connection to related networks of telephone systems and all related devices at JWC and JFTC;

- NATO Core Network (NCN), which will include (not exhaustive list) the relocation, reconfiguration, and integration of already installed NATO Core Switch (NCS) at JWC only in the existing NCN;

 - PTC, which will include (not exhaustive list) the provision, installation, relocation, reconfiguration and integration of already installed PTC nodes at JWC and JFTC;

- Complementary Efforts and Services (CES), which will include (not exhaustive list) the installation, configuration and integration of PFE, mainly consisting of cryptographic devices, and any additional effort required to deliver a full communication capability at each location. 

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued.

Personnel working on this project at NATO sites are required to have a NATO SECRET security clearance. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for those personnel.
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 27 September 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: end of October 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: December 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: April 2007

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: High-Impact California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) Projects Resulting in Evidence-Based Policy or Program Changes with The Regents of the University of California, UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 10960 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1550,  Los Angeles, CA 90024

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The Applied Research Program?s (ARP) mission is to evaluate patterns and trends in cancer control using population-based surveys.  An essential contribution to this effort is the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). Widely regarded as a state-of-the-art health survey, CHIS is nationally recognized for its inclusiveness of ethnic and racial diversity through sample design and linguistic and cultural adaptation of its questionnaires, its more precise measurement of health insurance and access to care, the broad array of public health issues it covers, its extensive formal structures for community participation in designing the survey, and its comprehensive and wide dissemination of results and data to diverse constituencies.  

CHIS data have been used by researchers, policy makers, advocates, media and foundations at the local, state and national levels as well as by health care providers.  Evidence from CHIS has been used to expand health coverage, obtain additional funding and modify programs that have improved health and health care in California.  

Contractor requirements:  1) Identify examples in which CHIS data have contributed to changes in policy, programs or other public health activities. A) Create an inventory of cases using CHIS data identified from administrative files, workshop/training attendees, users of Center publications, media hits, funders, and local health departments and B) define high impact examples by specifying the criteria they will use for selecting them. The total number of case studies and criteria used to select them will be agreed upon collaboratively with NIH and the Center staff.  The case studies will include examples of primary and secondary prevention that affect a range of diseases (e.g., tobacco control, diet, weight, and physical activity) that will be of use to the NIH Office of Disease Prevention and other NIH Institutes and Centers as well as the National Cancer Institute.  2) Select from the inventory high-impact examples for in-depth examination. Selected case studies will include a broad range of different types of impact including policy, program planning and development, as well as advocacy efforts. High-impact studies should include a variety of outcomes such as primary prevention, screening and health insurance.  Examples of topics could include obtaining funding to improve access to care, supporting new efforts to cover the uninsured, using data to better serve ethnic or immigrant communities, and building healthier communities, among others. Subjects of interest may include diabetes, asthma, cancer screening, food insecurity, children?s health insurance, diet/nutrition, obesity, physical activity and tobacco use. Contractor shall conduct qualitative research with key informants including researchers, advocates, officials and others to understand the process by which CHIS data and products were effectively used. The project will use accepted techniques of qualitative research.  

The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research is the only source known to the NCI that has qualified researchers to conduct this case-study project. The Center has unique access to lists of CHIS users generated from its multiple channels of dissemination and interaction with varied constituencies throughout the state.  Also, UCLA Center for Health Policy Research staff brings to this project an exceptional depth of knowledge of the survey data and affiliated researchers and has experience in conducting both qualitative case studies and quantitative research.  Any other potential contractor would need to access the Center?s confidential data and develop equivalent expertise about CHIS prior to planning and conducting the project.  In addition, The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research founded  the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 1994.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Phase II study of Depsipeptide in Patients with Cutaneous and Relapsing Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma with City of Hope, National Medical Center, 1500 E. Durante Road Durante, California 91010.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The NCI, CCR studies a large variety of lymphomas and has found depsipeptide (FR901128) to be effective in the 
clinic and in patients with lymphoma. Depsipeptide is a member of a new class of agents, the histone deacetylase 
inhibitors (HDI), currently being evaluated in clinical trials.  Due to promising activity observed in phase I testing, 
a phase II trial of depsipeptide is ongoing for patients with cutaneous or peripheral T-cell lymphoma.  The first 
patients (43) were enrolled and treated with depsipeptide at NCI for this phase II trial.  It was felt that clearly 
depsipeptide showed promise as a drug that could become a future therapy for lymphoma but there needed to be
a specific number of patients to be sure that this was statistically significant.  The conclusive phase II trial will be
expanded to institutions throughout the United States and other countries.

Specific Project: Clinical Protocol - NCI-01-C-0049: Objectives: 1) determine the response rate and long term 
clinical effects in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma treated with depsipeptide and 2) Evaluate the molecular effects of depsipeptide in these patients.  Patients eligible for this protocol must have: 1) Measurable cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or pheripheral T-cell lymphoma, 2) No CNS lymphoma, 3) Four weeks since prior chemotherapy, 4) Three weeks since prior major surgery and, 5) Performance status: ECOG 0-2.

Contractor Requirements:  The contractor shall discuss the NCI Clinical Protocol with patients? with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma.  If the patient is willing to participate in the study, the contractor shall perform the necessary physicals and testing needed for a baseline assessment of the patient?s condition and to be sure of their eligibility as outlined above.  Once patient is enrolled, they will receive depsipeptide and be treated on designed intervals. Patient shall have blood tests, ECGs, MRIs, Muga scans, review of numerous medical records and physical histories.  

Large medical centers were contacted regarding the Phase II study and the only medical center that responded was The City of Hope.  They currently have patients from the West Coast area that are eligible for the Phase II Clinical Protocol and come from a variety of cultural backgrounds which will add to the number of current patient population under this study.  As a result of the patients? diverse cultural backgrounds, their diversity will be beneficial to determine the utility of depsipeptide as a future cancer therapy. The City of Hope National Medical Center is the only source known within the United States that have patients eligible for this study.

Period of Performance:  Award through six (6) months.  Only one (1) award will be made.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Cancer Risk following Radiation Exposure from Computed Tomography in Children an Adolescents-Pilot Study with Sir James Spence Institute, 		 Pediatric and Lifecourse Epidemiology Research Group, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne
United Kingdom.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

Empirical data is lacking and the data available from potential collaborators in the U.S. is of insufficient quality and comprehensiveness for scientific research, researchers from the NCI and the Pediatric and Lifecourse Epidemiology Research Group (PLERG) in the University of Newcastle, proposes to perform  a cohort study in the United Kingdom (UK). The study includes the evaluation of cancer incidence and mortality among 200,000 children who had CT examinations in large radiology departments in the United Kingdom (UK) between January 1985 and December 1995, This contract is to survey potential large radiology departments in the United Kingdom (UK) to assess the availability, the quality, and completeness of their computerized CT listings and historical medical files. The data obtained in the survey will allow us to determine which departments will be included in the cohort study.  To allow sufficient statistical power, a study on late effects of pediatric CT scans should include a large cohort of scanned children and long follow up period. NCI plans to achieve this by assembling a cohort of 200,000 children and adolescents who received CT scans 10 to 20 years ago and were retrospectively followed for cancer occurrence using medical records. The estimated follow-up period of the planned study will cover approximately 2.3 million person-years. 

Unlike the USA, The United Kingdom has nation-wide registries for incident cancers and for causes of death which enable reliable, objective outcome assessment. It also has a national health service (NHS) that guarantees everyone receives medical care. In the NHS most, if not all, pediatric CT scans are performed in hospital radiology departments so that near-complete exposure assessment data can be obtained, and equally important, the records of these scans are stored for at least 20 years. Therefore, NCI investigators plan to examine the possibility of conducting the study in the United Kingdom.  The requested service is to conduct a survey of at least thirty (30) radiology departments in the UK.  The data to be collected are necessary to the planning the cohort study.

The section on Medical Biophysics, LIMB, has developed a theory of chronic photochemical injury driving Age-related Macular Degeneration and a biophysical model of the age-dependent changes in different fluorescent photoproducts (A2PEH2, A23, A2EO and A2Eon) that accumulate in the retina in concentrations related to the spectral imbalances of the light retina the retina which increase with age.  In order to test this hypothesis, it is necessary to image the retinal autofluorescence in a manner that can separate the contribution of these major fluorescent molecules which requires a combination of images using different excitation and emission wavelengths.  In order to achieve this it is necessary to procure this equipment from Heidelberg Engineering.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however; all responses received, before the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Venture Capitalist Consulting Services and intends to issue a noncompetitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to Alan Marty for continued services. The current contract expires September 30, 2006. The extension will cover the  period October 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. The contractor shall provide consulting as a Venture Capitalist for the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Demonstrations Team. It is anticipated that the RFP will be released during the third quarter of calendar year 2006.	 Extension of the Venture Capitalist Consulting contract through March 31, 2007 will allow for continued assistance to NASA in assessing the business and management performance of selected COTS partners and their financial progress and viability; monitoring business and management information received from partners and assessing the information for trends that might indicate programmatic risk, and proposing to NASA strategies for abating such risk; doing due diligence on companies that require large sums of private investment to perform negotiated milestones; and attending periodic meetings or briefings at partner locations as directed by NASA.  Mr. Marty is uniquely qualified to perform the services needed by NASA. Although there are numerous venture capitalists performing consulting services, there are many fewer with experience within the aerospace industry and there are no others with the depth and breadth of experience within NASA based on his involvement in Red Planet Capital, Ames Commercial Space Portal, the Innovative Partnerships Program, and Commercial Orbital Transportation Services. The extension will provide for continued services during the six month period October 1, 2006 through March 31, 2006, critical to success of the project.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Oblon, Spivak, McClelland, Maier, & Neustadt, PC, 1755 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202 to provide legal consultation and assistance in the field of trademark law for the period September 2006 through September 2007, in accordance with the statement of work.
Background:  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is faced with a unique situation in which excellent quality of legal consultation and assistance in the field of trademark law is needed on very short notice.  The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has authority to conduct all trademark-related work on behalf of all the agencies in the Public Health Service (PHS). The NHLBI has a complex trademark issue which OGC has been handling, but additional guidance from experienced attorneys specializing in trademark law is now required.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall initiate all necessary negotiations and administrative proceedings required to bring to a satisfactory conclusion actions undertaken by the OGC under a previous purchase order (263-MQ-607935) regarding the trademarks claimed by the American Heart Association (AHA) that appear to be confusingly similar to NHLBI?s NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY marks and RED DRESS Design marks.  Contractor shall begin discussions with counsel representing the AHA to outline terms for a possible agreement between the NHLBI and the AHA regarding the disputed trademarks.  Extensive materials have already been supplied to contractor as part of their work on the matter in question and contractor has rendered its expert opinion concerning the strength of those materials in support of the rights of the NHLBI.  Contractor shall, after consulting with OGC and NHLBI,  draft correspondence to counsel for the AHA transmitting such of those materials as it deems appropriate in an effort to convince the AHA of the validity of the NHLBLI claims of priority.  Depending upon the response of the AHA, Contractor will either initiate negotiations for a settlement with counsel for the AHA or prepare drafts of the Notices of Opposition for any American Heart Association? applications to register the NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY marks and/or RED DRESS Design marks that have published for opposition within the period of performance for this purchase order as well as Petitions to Cancel any registration issuing in the name of American Heart Association?s for NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY marks and RED DRESS Design marks within the period of performance.   Deliverables:  Contractor shall provide suggested strategy to OGC and NHLBI, written and oral communications with counsel for the AHA providing relevant supporting materials for the claims of the NHLBI along with an analysis indicating the strength of those claims.  Contractor shall prepare drafts of the Notices of Oppositions, if settlement with American Heart Association is not possible, for any American Heart Association?s application to register the NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY marks and/or RED DRESS Design marks that have published for opposition within the period of performance of this purchase order or the previous purchase order, and Petitions to Cancel any registration issuing in the name of the American Heart Association for NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY marks and RED DRESS Design marks within the period of performance of this purchase order or the previous purchase order or, after consultation with OGC and NHLBI,  the contractor shall prepare appropriate correspondence related to settlement and appropriate terms for a settlement  to indicate that American Heart Association has dropped its claim of ownership.  Contractor shall provide written communications and draft and file briefs, petitions, and other papers related to advocating NHLBI?s claim before the Trademark Office, up to and including positioning the case for appeal before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or a federal district court.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Oblon, Spivak, McClelland, Maier & Neustadt (Oblon) has already performed  extensive work on NHLBI?s claims to National Wear Red Day and the Red Dress design marks through services provided by a contract and subsequent purchase orders procured by the NIH Office of General Counsel through the NCI & NHLBI.  Because of the time constraints and filing deadlines associated with the proceedings, it is imperative that Oblon be engaged to continue work on this matter.  It would not be feasible for another firm to become sufficiently expert on the relevant legal issues and the extensive evidentiary base to provide advice and initiate necessary actions in a timely manner.  Moreover, unnecessary costs would be incurred by the government for another contractor to attain the level of familiarity that Oblon has already attained with the relevant legal issues and the extensive evidentiary base.  An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

The expected period of performance is one (1) year from the date of the award.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of  $6.5 M.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive  proposals.  Interested parties  may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-HL-2006-317DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>The Office of National Drug Control Policy through the Department of Health and Human Services, intends to award a sole source contract to The University of  Utah.  

The purpose of the contract is to conduct research using stable isotope ratio analysis for the identification of the geographic region-of-origin of drug specimens in major urban drug markets.  The University of Utah is the only source that is qualified to perform the analysis.  Based on the University's development of proprietary data and the development of the predictive model, The University of Utah has the unique ability to combine a mapping of isotope ratio with the measurement of an adequate number of plant samples to enable a model to be developed for determining the source area of drug seizure samples from a wide geolocational area.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days  after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPIS/SOLICITATION.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is SAQM-PD-06-R-1138 and this solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This will be a Firm-Fixed-Price, Research and Development type of contract with multiple awards and one (1) award set-aside for small business.  Interested small businesses should also reference their 8(a), HUBZone, service-disability veteran-owned status and their American/Alaskan Native Company (ANC) status.  Upon completion of the R&D process, The Government does not guarantee future orders.  The Government intends to use NAICS: 327211, Flat Glass Manufacturing, 1000 Employee Size Standard.  The US Department of State (DOS) has a requirement to devise methods of providing radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) attenuating glazing systems for its office buildings.  The current method of achieving this goal is through the application of aftermarket window film products that incorporate proprietary materials to provide the required attenuation.  While effective, this approach does present potential technical challenges and presents a life cycle cost burden.  The intent of this solicitation is to foster development of viable alternative methods of providing comparable RF/IR attenuation that are in consonance with traditional glazing techniques and compatible with industry accepted methods of utilizing glazing elements and manufacturing/assembling windows and glazed curtain wall systems.

<DESC>The Unitized Group Ration-A(UGR-A) is a ration consisting of the semi-perishable and perishable foods and disposable items(e.g., cups, trays, trash bags) necessary to feed fifty individuals during peacetime training, as well as mobilization operations.  The meal modules consist of a semi-perishable module (2 cases) containing the semi-perishable food components and disposable items, and the frozen perishable module (1 case), which are delivered concurrently.  A minimum shelf life of three (3) months shall be remaining at time of CONUS requirements.  OCONUS requirements, which are FOB Origin acceptance, require 9-month shelf life at time of receipt.  The UGR-A consists of 21 menus (7 breakfasts, 14 lunch/dinner.)  The components are readily available commercial items.  The purpose of the UGR-A program is to maximize and expedite the Services ability to provide high quality food service meals using using commercial, readily available food items(A Rations) to military personnel during worldwide operations.  The UGR-A Ration objectives include (i) simplify and streamline the customers ordering process by establishing two stock numbers to order a complete meal in lieu of multiple menu components, (ii) simplify and streamline the distribution/food handling process in the field by consolidating and clearly identifying the complete components of a single meal; (iii) eliminate inventory carrying costs by utilizing direct vendor deliveries(DVD) to customers on an as needed basis; and (iv) result in overall cost savings in the total food supply chain.  CONUS meals are not intended to be stocked by the Services and direct vendor delivery to all customers will be utilized.  OCONUS rations may be stored in Prime Vendor facilities in such locations as Korea, Kuwait, Dubai and Kabul or delivered DVD for customers in Germany, Puerto Rico and Honduras.  OCONUS deliveries are made FOB Origin by contractors, and shipped overseas via Defense Distribution Center.  This acquisition will provide complete ration modules for each menu, for 19 CONUS and 15 OCONUS installations.  The solicitation will include actual order history for each of the 19 installations for FY05.  An IQC minimum of 20% of the entire contract estimate, will be utilized.  This level provides greater flexibility to the Government and allows it to utilize other suppliers, in the event of unacceptable performance, without the execution of a default termination.  An IQC maximum of 300% is used to assure contract coverage in the event of large scale training or other contingencies.  Estimated quantities for the 14 month base period and  2-two year Option periods, respectively, are:  38,321 modules and 76,642 modules for each Option period.  Complete commercial item descriptions for each item in each menu were developed by DSCP, Natick and ACES and have been approved by authorized military food service representatives.  The UGR-A ration and specifications are totally commercial.  Utilizing Best Value/Trade-off source selection procedures, this solicitation will indicate that technical merit is more important than price.  It is the Governments intention to make an award to the offerors who indicate the overall best value utilizing the trade off process between price and non-price factors.  Solicitation will be issued unrestricted with a Hubzone Price Evaluation Preference.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A—INTRODUCTION -- MNK-BAA-06-0001B (Flash/Staring Ladar Seeker (SLS)  Special Amendment) (Part 2 of 2):

C--ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

(1) Type of Contract:  The Government anticipates negotiating one Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for this effort, but does not preclude other actualities if it is determined to be in the Government’s best interest.  

(2) Expected Award Date:  Late September, 2006.

(3) Anticipated Period of Performance:  The SLS Program contract is anticipated to take 45 months. 

(4) Government Estimate:  The Government expects to fund up to approximately $7.475K on contract for this program (baseline effort plus 2 priced options).  This figure includes approximately $20K, $1,671K, $1,995K, $2,685K and $1,104K in each of FY06-FY10, respectively.  This funding profile is an estimate only and is not a promise of funding, as all funding is subject to changes/availability and Government discretion.  

(5) Government Furnished Items (GFI):  The Government may assist in providing GFI, based on availability, if requested.  Therefore, the offeror shall include a detailed list of Government resources (material formulation instructions, lethality assessment software, target models, etc.), and their associated approximate costs, required to execute a contract in a timely and cost effective manner.  

(6) Request For Technical Annex:  Technical annex, Minimum Performance Factors for the SLS, as it applies to precision guided munitions, may be obtained by sending a certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, appropriate clearance data, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and approved mailing address to Capt Jade Lemery via email, mail or fax (see Section F – Points of Contact, paragraph (2)).  After acceptance of these items, this data package may be obtained in person or via U.S. mail.  Request should be provided early enough to allow the Government 14 days to provide the document.  No supplemental documentation will be provided unless requested in strict accordance with these instructions.

(7) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms:  It has been formally determined that foreign participation will be prohibited.  Exceptions may include those contractors with an agreement with the US State Department and a current facility clearance, copies of which should be provided to Section F Points of Contact.  

(8)  Hazardous Materials:  The contractor must identify any hazardous materials to be used in performance of this effort in the White Paper and any subsequently requested Formal Proposal.

D-- WHITE PAPER AND PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:

(1) White Papers:  White Papers should address all areas indicated by the Evaluation Factors in Section E – Basis for Award, including how the contractor intends to achieve the objectives/requirements outlined in Section B—Requirements, of this Amendment for the entire program.  Applicable experience and past performance and data rights should be addressed.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate should be provided and should indicate annual funding as well as major sub-effort funding requirements.  Additionally, the white papers shall include any partners, subcontractors, etc., to be utilized, discuss risk (schedule and otherwise) assessment and technology maturity level required to meet requirements.  Finally, the white papers should be structured to reflect the baseline effort and priced options described in Section B item 4.

 (2) General:  All offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision at FAR 52.215-1 (e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data, to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals.  For formal proposals, submit separate Technical and Cost Volumes, and mark them as valid for 180 days.  Volume 1 should provide the Technical Proposal addressing the objectives/ requirements and should be unclassified, if possible.  Anyelectrically. Improved system performance will be realized through increased frame rates, elimination of the need for motion compensation, and increased area coverage.  In addition, with agile or electronic scanning techniques it is expected that staring Ladar seekers will provide a simultaneous search and track function due to its fast frame rates.

Because this is expected to be a single contract award, potential offerors should, at a minimum, possess and have demonstrated experience in a variety of technology areas. Some of the key technology areas include laser physics, optical detector arrays, read out integrated circuit (ROIC) design, ATA algorithms, and system integration.  The laser developed under this program must have sufficient output power to achieve the system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) necessary for accurate 3D imaging at ranges commensurate with guided munition operation. (See Technical Annex) In addition, the laser operation must provide the range resolution (See Technical Annex) necessary to perform ATA functions with accuracy.  The purpose of the optical detector array is to sense the laser energy reflected from objects, which may include non-cooperative targets, within the FOV. The detector array developed under this program must be large enough to cover the FOV (See Technical Annex) while providing sufficient number of pixels on target (at range) to successfully perform the ATA functions encountered in autonomously guided weapon operation.  The detector array must have adequate sensitivity such that, when combined with the received laser power, a reasonable amount of return signal is detected and accurate 3D imaging can occur.  Clearly, the offeror must understand and be able to provide and defend a detailed system SNR analysis. The system SNR is a strong function of the seeker design and components chosen and directly impacts seeker performance. Also, the responsivities within the detector array must be sufficiently uniform across the pixel field or non-uniformity corrections (NUC) will be required to accurately measure range, intensity, and then perform the necessary ATA functions. Finally, it is important for the offeror to be able to present and defend detector designs that meet the bandwidth requirements associated with the range resolution and accuracy needed (See Technical Annex). The purpose of the ROIC is to accept the output of the detector array and, through appropriate circuit design, perform amplification if necessary and determine accurate range and intensity values at the pixel level. The range and intensity values are then sent to a processor that performs the ATA functions. More advanced ROIC designs may include logic for multiple returns within the same pixel and/or fully sample the detector output at the pixel level.  The purpose of the ATA algorithms is to accept the parallel data stream output from the Ladar sensor, process that data, and pass on decision-based information to various seeker controls. As part of that decision-based process, the ATA algorithms are required to perform target acquisition, classification, identification, and aim point selection. Each of these capabilities is a strong function of range to target, range resolution, and pixels on target.  Adequate system integration plays a key role in this effort.  AFRL/MNGS has invested almost $10M in developing and demonstrating staring Ladar seeker technologies.  Under this effort, the final deliverable will have to meet minimum performance factors (MPFs) including a volumetric constraint commensurate with integration to a precision guided weapon.  The MPFs are available to all qualified contractors.  Reference paragraph (6) Request for Technical Annex in C--Additional Information.  

(3)  Test Support:  The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware and software products to be tested.  Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, are expected to become schedule milestones.  For tests being conducted at Government facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for providing technical support, analysis, data and test planning support to the identified responsible Government test organization.  The contractor shall provide test support to include the following: support of test planning meetings; test setup advice; test article build up; checkout; installation of hardware; instrumentation package support required documentation for testing; identification of risk and suggestion of improvements; record test setup; data collection for evaluation of results; post-test analysis and test result documentation.  It is expected that ground-based tests will be conducted.

(4)  Program Tasking:  This development effort will consist of a baseline effort and two priced options.  The baseline effort will include modeling & simulation and design activities supporting preliminary design and critical design milestones.  Option 1 will include subcomponent fabrication, laboratory testing, and final system-level design.  Option 2 will include system integration & ground-based testing.  In order to proceed to Option 1 and Option 2 of development, the offeror will be required to meet AFRL/MNGS defined criteria as outlined below.  

(a) Baseline effort to Option 1 gate: The criteria to proceed with Option 1 will be based on the soundness of the design approach as well as ability to address the system requirements and applicable parameters described in the technical annex.  The Critical Design Review (CDR) will be the decision point to continue with Option 1.  

(b) Option 1 to Option 2 gate: The criteria to proceed with Option 2 will be based on subcomponent verification testing and soundness of the final system-level design.  If given approval to proceed with Option 2, the contractor will complete the system level integration and demonstrate the seeker in ground-based tests.

(5) Management:  The contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements of this contract, including but not limited to, cost, technical, schedule, and security.  The contractor shall communicate the technical and programmatic status through Data Requirements submissions discussed in Section/paragraph B(6) and scheduled meetings discussed in Section/paragraph B(7).  In addition to formal design reviews, informal program status interchanges (such as weekly teleconferences) are encouraged.  The contractor shall provide technical risk assessment, program schedule and cost of contract.

<DESC>A—INTRODUCTION -- MNK-BAA-06-0001B (Flash/Staring Ladar Seeker (SLS)  Special Amendment) (Part 1 of 2):

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Seekers Branch (AFRL/MNGS) is interested in receiving white papers for the Flash/Staring Ladar Seeker (SLS) Program under this Special Amendment to the Armament Technology Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-06-0001, Research Area 7 – Laser Radar Component Research.  The SLS program is one part of a coordinated set of technology development programs being initiated by AFRL/MN to enable the capabilities envisioned under the Area Dominance Integrating Concept (ADIC).  The goal of the ADIC is to develop & transition technologies needed for a next-generation, persistent (i.e. loitering) munition capability to hold & deny area access.  The SLS will provide persistent search function using high resolution 3D Ladar.  In addition, the SLS will perform low false alarm rate target identification (ID).  Upon positive target ID the AD munition will execute target attack.  The challenge is to design a robust suite of technologies that will integrate into a low-cost solution.

White paper submittals should reference “MNK-BAA-06-0001B (SLS)”.  Where the instructions in MNK-BAA-06-0001 differ from the instructions in this Special Amendment, this document prevails.  White papers should not exceed 30 letter-size pages, using either Arial or Times New Roman font, with not less than 12-pitch type size, and should be submitted not later than 3 PM Central Time to AFRL/MNK on 5 Jun 06.  White papers should include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for the SLS Program.  It is anticipated that one of the white papers may be selected for further consideration, and the originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract for the SLS Program.  However that number could change, depending upon the Government’s needs and successful negotiations.  Six hard copies and one electronic copy (on a CD or DVD) of the white papers should be submitted to the AFRL/MNK Contracting Office to the parties shown in Section F – Points of Contact, paragraph (1).  Email submissions will not be accepted.  A confirmation of receipt may be generated via email as white papers are received (if an email address is provided with the white paper).  All submittals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Evaluation Criteria found in Section E - Basis for Award.  Offerors should be alert to any amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend due dates or other data as necessary, and to make awards without discussions.

B--REQUIREMENTS:  

(1) Program Objective:  The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a staring Ladar seeker (SLS) for autonomously guided munitions. The period of performance for this program is expected to be approximately 45 months.

(2) Program Description: The future evolution of Ladar seekers is towards system architectures based on focal plane array (FPA) technologies, ranging and reflectance imaging techniques. This program will develop a FPA-based Ladar seeker and integrate newly developed Autonomous Target Acquisition (ATA) algorithms for use with future autonomously guided weapons. Such a development represents the next generation of Ladar seekers.  A staring Ladar seeker will illuminate the entire field of view (FOV) and produce 3D imagery using a large array of detectors with the appropriate pulse capture electronics and a reflectance image. The FPA-based Ladar is expected to result in reduced cost, increased robustness, and improved seeker performance relative to existing raster scanned systems. Reduced costs will be realized through the elimination/simplification of the scanning mechanisms (currently 2 axis gimbals). Increased robustness will be realized through overall system simplification both mechanically and  classified material must be provided in a separate Annex and must be properly marked and handled as such.  Provide classified material directly to Capt Jade Lemery rather than to AFRL/MNK.  Volume 2, Cost Proposal, must be unclassified, and should address the price, cost details, and a risk assessment of the proposal.  Questions should be directed to the appropriate points of contact listed in Section F.    

(3) Technical Proposal:  In the event that the white paper results in an invitation to submit a Formal Proposal, Volume 1 -Technical Proposal shall include, as a minimum, a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) for the contract and a contract schedule based on the baseline effort and priced options described in Section B item 4.    Volume 1 should fully address the approach in accomplishing the Program objectives/requirements of Section B above.  The contractor must also provide a summary of relevant past and present performance.  Relevant past and present performance is defined as performance by the proposed program manager, lead technical investigator and/or chief engineer supporting staring Ladar development programs within the last five years, or past efforts by other key personnel proposed by the offeror for performance of this contract.  State the capacity in which these individuals acted in these relevant programs.  The offeror must provide sufficient technical discussion and technical detail to establish the soundness of the proposed approach; provide an adequate basis for assessing program technical cost and schedule risk; and form a sound basis for the cost proposed in Volume 2.  Proposals failing to provide adequate technical detail and discussion may be considered technically unresponsive to this BAA Special Amendment.  In this proposal, the contractor must demonstrate knowledge of the systems engineering process and make realistic assumptions of how the proposed technology increases performance at the missile system level.	

(4) Cost Proposal:  The Volume 2 Formal Cost Proposal must include and segregate the contract costs, and also provide a total summary.  It must reflect the baseline effort and priced options described in Section B item 4 separately.  The contract costs shall include, as a minimum, a labor category and man-hour breakdown including applicable labor rates, a cost element summary including labor, material, travel, other direct costs, overheads, G&A, etc., and reflecting all rates for the contract and data, and an expenditure schedule for the entire program.  The offeror shall include estimates for the cost/value of any Government-Furnished Equipment/Property/Information, etc. requested, and all costs expected to be incurred by the Government associated with providing the equipment, facilities, support, etc., necessary to meet the contractor’s testing requirements.  Any costs associated with data or data rights shall be separately identified in the cost proposal.  Any awardee should expect to certify cost and pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.  

(5) Page Limitations:  White Papers are limited to 30 pages, which will include a ROM cost estimate.  Formal Technical Proposal shall be limited to a total of 50 pages, including charts, figures, tables, etc.  Proposed SOWs  and resumes may be included as appendices, and will not be counted in the page limitations.  The Government reserves the right to remove and return to the offeror any excess pages before the formal evaluation starts.  Formal Cost Proposal will have no page limitation; however, the offeror is requested to keep the cost proposal to 30 pages -- less, if possible.  Cost proposal spreadsheets must be submitted in Microsoft Excel format.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 12-pitch, using Arial or Times New Roman font, with line spacing of not less than one and one-half for the typeface used (no more than 34 lines per page) for formal proposals.  White Papers may be single-spaced.  Five hard copies should be provided.  Proposals shall be submitted as an original document plus five paper copies, and one copy of both the Technical and Cost Proposals should be submitted on CD or DVD.   Note:  Submittal of a proposal constitutes contractor’s authorization for limited reproduction and dissemination within Government agencies and National Laboratories for evaluation purposes only, as stated in FAR 52.215-1(e).  

(6) Preparation Costs:  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise obligate the Government.  The US Air Force reserves the right to award sufficient contracts, based on the proposals received, to meet the Government’s needs.

(7) Data Rights:  The Government anticipates and strongly urges unlimited data rights to all data generated under this contract, to include drawings and results.  The contractor is instructed to address data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc., in the white paper and the formal proposal.

E—BASIS FOR AWARD:

Evaluation Criteria:  White Papers and proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section B--Requirements, of this BAA Special Amendment, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below.  Additionally, a risk assessment will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the Best Value to the Government.  Awards may be made without discussions.  Factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Although Cost is less important than Technical, it is still considered a significant factor.

<CONTACT>Leslie Leavitt Purchasing Agent 7022938642     LLeavitt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the University of Colorado, 3100 Marine Street, Room 481, Boulder, CO 80309-0572.   This purchase order is for enhancements to the RiverWare Modeling software and associated software tools and Hydrologic Database (HDB) from the University of Colorado Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CU-CADSWES).  CADSWES will enhance the database of record within HDB, and improve usability features.  CADSWES will develop rules associated with policy within RiverWare, develop new physical process algorithms, usability features related to RiverWare software applications, improve overall model performance, and perform modeling studies for special situations. Since 1993, Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the U.S. Geological Survey, and CADSWES have participated in a collaborative research and development program to develop Decision Support tools for water management.  Two major applications from this program are used by Boulder City Operations Office (BCOO):  RiverWare, a generalized river and reservoir simulation system, and HDB, a river and reservoir data management system.  These software systems are integral to the daily scheduling and monitoring of water deliveries for the Lower Colorado River System.  Annually,  approximately 9 million acre-feet of water are scheduled and released from Lake Mead to meet the delivery orders of water entitlement holders in the U.S. and for 1944 Water Treaty deliveries to Mexico.  The scheduling and monitoring of this volume of water via a system of dams, powerplants and diversion canals requires that RiverWare and the HDB be operational at all times. CADSWES developed, enhances, and maintains these packages for the users and is, therefore, the only entity able to provide these services. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is September 6, 2006.  Questions may be directed to Leslie Leavitt at (702) 293-8642 or email to:  lleavitt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310 and the size standard is $6 million.

<DESC>ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Region 3, intends to procure on a sole-source basis with VEMCO (a division of Amirix Systems Inc.), remote electronic transmitters and receivers to perform an Asian carp telemetry project on the Illinois River. The remote ultrasonic receivers placed in the Illinois River will be part of the larger telemetry array that currently exists on the Mississippi River drainage.  Compatibility between ultrasonic transmitters and receivers is necessary to ensure that the telemetry array functions properly. In addition, the purchase of VEMCO transmitters and receivers is required so that fish tagged by the Service can be detected on the array already in place on the Mississippi River. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000. Award of a purchase order is anticipated to be approximately September 6, 2006.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to small business only, preferrably those on the GSA IT schedule.  The Federal Election Commission  (FEC) is seeking potential sources to provide a sampling software program that will replace the sampling software currently utilized.  Specifically, the FEC Audit Division has the responsibility for administering the Presidential Matching fund program by determining  that candidates meet the eligibility requirements, reviewing requests for funds and certifying the amounts to which candidates are entitled.  The sampling software functionality must include monetary unit, attribute, and classic variables sampling capability.  Sample procedures should include sample size calculation, sample selection from a file or from a sequence number, evaluate sample results at various levels of reliability and tolerable risk using either a one side or two-sided analysis.  Additionally, the software must include the ability to expand a sample that does not produce an estimate that meets sampling risk criteria; be compatible with common electronic file formats and perform various queries and data mining functions.   The architecture platform for Federal Election Commission's major applications is Java 2 Enterprise Edition web based application with Oracle as backend database.  The sampling software should provide a program interface that can easily integrate with other systems and databases.  It is also preferable that the sampling software be a web based server side application. If the respondent's description of the software program selects sample items by systematic or interval selection rather than random, discuss whether there are any additional sampling risk associates with this method.  

Any respondent that may possess the capabilities to provide this software program should respond to this notice no later than September 13, 2006, 12:00 noon.  Interested parties to this notice should mail capabilities information to: Federal Election Commission, Attn: J Connell, 999 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20463.

<DESC>Statement of Objectives
Payment Tools for Field Decennial Activities


The U.S. Census Bureau has a requirement to provide payment tools and mechanisms in lieu of cash or paper checks issued through Treasury to support three Decennial events.

Background

The overarching goals of the 2010 Census are to improve the accuracy of population and housing inventory data, provide more timely data, reduce operational risks, and contain costs.  The Census Bureau must plan for, hire, train, and pay a temporary workforce that is diverse and representative of the Nation's population to conduct the 2010 Census all within a specified time frame.  

The Decennial Census includes the entire United States, including extremely rural or remote areas, American Indian reservations with few banking facilities, and less-affluent urban neighborhoods underserved by the financial industry.  The Census Bureau is committed to recruiting and hiring a local workforce from each community being enumerated even in the most remote areas, regardless of the challenges. 

Decennial census staff includes Census employees within Local Census Offices as well as field staff such as enumerators, crew leaders, Field Operations Supervisors, address listers, and other personnel. Enumerators and other field staff typically work from their homes and travel from residence-to-residence in their assignment area. They submit payroll information daily and are paid wages portal-to-portal and receive reimbursement for mileage and other expenses on a weekly basis. The majority of decennial appointments are temporary, lasting anywhere from four to eight weeks.  Employees are constantly moving in and out of these temporary positions.  A large number of the workforce is students, retirees, homemakers, or those just seeking to supplement their income.  There are others who take a census job until they can secure permanent employment elsewhere. For many temporary Census field employees, a missing or delayed check creates a serious cash flow problem, and in many cases means that the employee will be unwilling or unable to continue performing his or her assignment.  

In remote areas like Alaska, the Bureau has found that the distance between residences and commercial banking establishments may exceed 300 miles and that many employees not have bank accounts or access to financial institutions. Because of the distance scale and terrain, employees in such areas may need to charter planes and boats or hire dog sleds to perform their assignments.  Obtaining such services often requires immediate payment by cash or cash-like instruments, and in most cases there is no access to a bank or an automated teller machine to obtain cash.  In past censuses employees sometimes endorsed paper checks to other persons.  Sometimes these checks were endorsed ten times before reaching the bank for negotiation.  

In less-affluent urban neighborhoods, many employees do not have bank accounts and must pay high fees to cash paychecks at check-cashing establishments. Because employees look at the net amount that they clear, these fees can be a disincentive to taking a Census job.


In the 2010 Census, employees will be paid weekly with the first paycheck issued within 11 days after the close of the weekly pay period.  In addition to paying salaries, any approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees will be reimbursed for official business such as mileage, bus fares, and telephone charges.  A single payment will be issued for both salary and reimbursable expenses.

During the 2000 Census, the Census Bureau hired more than 872,000 employees and paid nearly $1.8 billion nationwide.  At the busiest time in the census, the Bureau successfully paid some 512,826 employees in a single week.  Payments were issued using such instruments as Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), U.S. Treasury checks, and Convenience Checks.  While 83% of employees participated in the EFT program, the remaining 17% were issued paper checks for various reasons. After the Census, the convenience check program was criticized for lack of control and accountability.   

Purpose

The purpose of this statement is to obtain information about payment tools and mechanisms to support Census 2010 operations. The U.S. Census Bureau is seeking alternatives to cash and checks issued through the U.S. Treasury to pay its employees, and convenience checks to obtain needed services in certain specific situations.  These situations include:  

1.	Payroll for Census employees without bank accounts ? Most Census employees are paid through ?direct deposit? electronic fund transfers.  However, it would be a serious disincentive to require potential employees to obtain a bank account before they can be employed.  Employees without bank accounts or who could not otherwise receive electronic fund transfers were paid with paper checks from the Treasury Department during the 2000 Decennial Census.
It is especially common for employees collecting data in soup kitchens and shelters to lack both bank accounts and fixed addresses.  In Census 2000, the Census Bureau delivered paper checks to either a named shelter or the local census office where employees could pick up the checks and cash them at local stores.
2.	Advances for travel expenses during initial training ? Prospective employees attend a training session to learn data collection procedures.  At the end of this session, trainees may request an advance of approximately $70 from future salary to cover travel expenses.  During Census 2000, approximately 4,500 trainees received these payments through convenience checks.
3.	Payments to cultural facilitators - Cultural facilitators perform a specific task for the Census Bureau but are not actually Census employees.  For example, a cultural facilitator might assist an enumerator in interviews where that enumerator does not speak the same language as household members. During Census 2000, approximately 1,000 payments were made to cultural facilitators using convenience checks.
4.	Payments to vendors who do not accept credit cards ? Occasionally the Census Bureau must purchase goods or services from vendors who cannot process credit card payments. Often the vendors are very small businesses or businesses located in very remote areas. Examples of the goods or services they provide include recruiting ads in community newspapers, translations of specific documents, or even dog sled rentals in rural Alaska.  These vendors were paid by convenience checks during Census 2000. 
5.	Emergency salary replacements- When an enumerator reports not receiving a pay check, it is often necessary to provide emergency replacement funds to keep him or her working. During Census 2000, such emergency salary replacement payments were made by convenience check. 

Scope

The payment tools for the Field Decennial activities effort encompasses the full range of information and services required to determine payment mechanisms to service such a diverse workforce and meet such varying needs while providing greater security and accountability than cash. The estimated number of temporary field employees is 1,500 employees during the 2008 Dress Rehearsal and 90,000 employees during the 2010 Decennial Census. 

Period of Performance

The bulk of activity will be between April and September 2008 for the Dress Rehearsal, and from April to September 2010, for the Decennial. The 2008 Dress Rehearsal will test the final system selected for the 2010 Census.

Place of Performance

The 2010 Decennial Census takes place in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  It covers cities, suburbs, rural areas, Indian reservations, and other remote areas.

Objectives

	To obtain financial services that include a payment mechanism, or a combination of payment mechanisms, that offer more security and accountability over paper checks. This payment mechanism or mechanisms must deliver payments reliably, accurately, and on a timely basis.
	To provide payment mechanisms for temporary Census staff that can be conveniently redeemed for cash or value.  Comprehensive coverage of the country is a major concern, and solutions must explicitly provide for provision of these mechanisms in the harder-to-service areas and situations presented above.
	To minimize or eliminate the need for Census Bureau personnel to cancel, track, and reissue lost, stolen, or missing payments.
	To capture account classification code data as a by-product of the issuance of these payment tools, minimizing the need for Census administrative personnel to capture and enter such information.  (Payroll accounting data for those without bank accounts will have been captured already.)



Constraints

	The Census Bureau must have these services in place by January 1, 2007.
	A cost restraint has yet to be determined.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Nielsen, (309) 782-8693
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential production sources for the SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispenser NSN 1370-01-158-5322. The SUU-25 F/A is used by the Air force on the A-10 aircraft to store and dispense LUU-1, LUU-2, LUU -4, LUU-5 and LUU-19 (target markers and illumination) flares in flight.  The SUU-25  F/A dispenser is approximately 14 in diameter by 92 long and holds 8 flares.  It is affixed to the aircraft by means of two suspension lugs and has two electrical receptacles.  Eight flares are loaded in the dispenser, two per launch tube, (one behind an other), and eight ARD-863impulse cartridges are loaded in the breech assembly prior to being installed onto the aircraft.  During flight, launch signals are initiated from the pilot and sent to the intervalometer (stepper switch), which in turn, sequential ly directs the firing pulse to each impulse cartridge in order. The impulse cartridge pressure is directed through a manifold to eject the flare from the aft position. As the flare leaves the launch tube, arming hooks in the dispenser pull the arming cap off of each flare to start the flare actuation timer.  The  intervalometer sequences to the second position for the fire pulse to initiate the impulse cartridge behind the flare in the forefront position. This is repeated in each subsequent tube until all of the flares have been dispensed.  The SUU-25 F/A dispense r is a mission critical item and must perform in a wide variety of extreme environmental and loading conditions.  The dispenser must be tested per Specification #SP8020305, Fabrication Specification Dispenser, Flare SUU-25F/A prior to acceptance.  The estimated procurement will be for a five year buy for a to tal estimated quantity of 150-225 rounds of SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispensers.  The SUU-25F/A consists of a wide variety of parts ranging from structural, to mechanical and electrical components.  Many different materials and processes are required to manufactur e the dispenser.  Some of the manufacturing processes are the following: tooling & machining operations, forming, shearing, and shaping of sheet metal, welding/mechanical fastening, electromechanical components, wiring & soldering, metal casting, plating/painting for corrosion protection.  Materials include various m etal alloys, polymers, and composites.  Potential manufacturer should provide a brief summary of their company size, descriptive information on the company, manufacturing capabilities (equipment, capacities, facilities, critical skills, possessed, quality control system) and past performance on items with similar complexity to the SUU-25 F/A Flare Dispenser.  In addition, it is requested that the potential manufacture provide the following information:  1.  What is an economical quantity for this item?  2.  What is a reasonable schedule for delivery that includes First Article Testing to include monthly production rates?  All interested sources are requested to submit responses in writing with clear and convincing documentation by close of 30 days after the date posted.  Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost obligation to the government.  That Government at its discretion and without explanation may choose not to purchase all or part of the quantity of the item herein.  The technical data package (TDP) is class ified per Distribution Statement D-limited distribution. Distribution Statement D means that the TDP cannot be routed via the internet.  Interested parties must be registered with the U.S./CANADA Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the Technical  Data Package  (see www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  The request must include: cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address and point of contact.  Please request a copy of the TDP via email from josephl@afsc.army.m il.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis to identify any firm(s) that are interested and qualified to provide the subject waterproofing membrane.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW) is requesting information for Multi-Ply Reinforced Rubber Modified Asphalt Sheet waterproofing systems to be installed on underground structures.  This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. The following information is provided to give the vendors information on the structure and the waterproofing system requirements.
1.	NAVFAC NW is considering the construction of a large underground structure which will require waterproofing of the below grade surfaces.  The static groundwater table at the site is normally below the bottom of the structure; however, there is a potential for perched groundwater collecting adjacent to, beneath, and above the structure. It is essential that the waterproofing materials installed protect the structure?s interior spaces from moisture intrusion (liquid and or vapor intrusion) for as long as practical, up to 50 years.

2.	There will be approximately 150,000 SF of vertical, under-slab, and roof-slab surfaces all of which require installation of a waterproofing system.  The roof slab surfaces include overhangs of up to 20 feet, and must be waterproofed on the top and the underside of the overhang.  The underground structure surface will have numerous interior and exterior corners, as well as numerous large and small diameter pipe and duct penetrations which the waterproofing membrane installation will have to contend with and protect.

3.	NAVFAC NW has studied numerous waterproofing materials and has determined that a Cold Applied Multi-Ply Reinforced Rubber Modified Asphalt Sheet system will provide the highest probability of success.  The Multi-Ply Reinforced Rubber Modified Asphalt Sheet waterproofing system shall contain the following salient characteristics:

?	The waterproofing system shall have been successfully used in similar underground applications for a minimum of 25 years.  A listing of installations and points of contact shall be available to the government upon request.
?	The waterproofing system shall be warranted for a minimum of 25 years.  The Warranty shall cover materials and workmanship, and shall include prompt onsite repair of any areas of water intrusion upon notification by the owner.  All costs associated with the repair or replacement work shall be the responsibility of the waterproofing manufacturer.
?	The waterproofing system shall be a single complete system installed by the manufacturer?s authorized installation personnel.  No special or unusual concrete treatment, embeds or inserts shall be required.  The manufacturer shall have a Quality Control organization that periodically inspects the waterproofing installation procedures and approves the completed installation.   A demonstration of water-tight installation will be required prior to final acceptance by the Government.
?	The waterproofing system must be capable of installation immediately after removal of the concrete forms, with no additional curing time.
?	The waterproofing system shall have the ability to easily waterproof interior and exterior corners, pipe and duct penetrations, expansion/control joints, and undersides of slab overhangs without the use of waterstops or other aids.
?	The waterproofing system shall have the ability to bridge small cracks during and after installation, and the system must be waterproof at the time of installation.
?	The waterproofing system shall have the capability of withstanding a water head of at least 70 feet, without water intrusion (liquid or vapor).
?	The waterproofing system shall not contain harmful products or generate noxious fumes during the life of the system.
?	The waterproofing system shall be durable during construction, backfilling, and its intended service life without requiring unusual protection methods.

Descriptive information is sought in the form of brochures, specification sheets, product histories, and company points of contact.  In addition, provide representative installed cost referenced to recent projects.  Deadline for submission is 9 September 2006. Information should be submitted to the attention of the Contract Specialist (in hard copy, electronic media, or e-mail) Rob Sergeson, Contract Specialist, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW), 1101 Tautog Circle, Suite 203, Silverdale, WA 98315-1101; (360) 396-0234; e-mail robert.sergeson@navy.mil

<SUBJECT>99--Notice of Intent to Issue a Single Source Award to VEMCO, a Division of Amirix Systems, Inc.
<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR have a requirement for the procurement of acoustic transmitters and underwater receivers manufactured by VEMCO for the Arcata Fish & Wildlife Office, Arcata, CA.  These items are needed to conduct a juvenile coho salmon smolt residence study that will begin in spring 2007.  The project is a cooperative effort between the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Currently, Arcata FWO uses VEMCO acoustic transmitters because they have a robust coding scheme and make the smallest coded acoustic transmitter available today, which is crucial to the studies of juvenile salmon.  Due to the proprietary nature of the VEMCO transmitters and receivers, only VEMCO units will interface with Arcata FWO existing VEMCO transmitters and receivers.   Price of purchasing receivers and transmitters to replace those currently owned by AFWO from other companies would be cost-prohibitive. The Service intends to award Sole Source to VEMCO.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1.

BLM-2006-OMCHS-001 October 2006 - September 2007 Introduction The purpose of this IFO is to continue implementation of the terms of the Helium Privatization Act (HPA) of 1996 dealing with the disposal of the Conservation Helium Reserve. The HPA requires the Department of the Interior (DOI) to offer for sale, beginning no later than 2005, a portion of the Conservation Helium stored underground at the Cliffside Field, north of Amarillo, Texas. The DOI, in consultation with the private helium industry, has determined that private companies, with refining capacity along the crude helium pipeline, will need a supply of helium in excess of that available from their own storage accounts and that available from crude helium extractors in the region. Given the current market, Conservation Helium sold in this sale will cause minimal market disruption. This is the fifth in a series of sales that the Department will conduct to dispose of the Conservation Helium stored underground at the Cliffside Field. The annual sales are being conducted in a manner intended to prevent pure helium market disruptions from occurring to end users; shortages of crude helium to pure helium refiners; and an oversupply of crude helium on the market for crude helium extractors. Subsequent sales may be adjusted as needed. The volume of helium available for this sale is 2,100 MMcf and will be offered in four equal quarterly increments of 525 MMcf. In accordance with the HPA, this volume was determined by dividing the total volume of stored Conservation Helium less the statutory required reservation of 600 MMcf for Government purposes less estimated In-Kind Crude Helium transfers for 12 years divided by 12. This volume represents a straightline basis for offering the helium for sale in accordance with the HPA. The Conservation Helium will be sold at the same price as In-Kind Crude Helium. In accordance with the HPA, this price covers helium debt repayment and its escalation by the Consumer Price Index since the helium debt was frozen in 1995. Additionally, the price includes administrative and storage costs associated with the Conservation Helium calculated on a per Mcf basis. For Fiscal Year 2007 that price is $58.75 per Mcf. Before submitting an offer, you will need to know the definitions of certain terms used in this IFO. These terms are defined at the end of the IFO. All requests for purchase of helium and other documentation as required in this IFO must be sent by certified mail to: 2 Bureau of Land Management, Amarillo Field Office 801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500 Amarillo, TX 79101-3545 Attention: Crude Helium Sales Analyst You may call Connie H. Neely, (806) 356-1027 with questions about this IFO. Term Submit your request for purchase and other documentation, as required, according to the following schedule: o First Quarter Offering - September 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006 o Second Quarter Offering - December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 o Third Quarter Offering - March 1, 2007 through March 31, 2007 o Fourth Quarter Offering - June 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007. On the next business day after the request to purchase Conservation Helium for the Quarter is received, it will be opened and evaluated. Upon evaluation, volumes of this Conservation Helium Sale will be apportioned and allocated according to the sale rules described in this IFO. Successful requestors will be notified in writing by BLM no later than one week after the end of the request period. Offers You must submit the following information to the BLM, Amarillo Field Office: o Billing address information and name(s) of principle officers of the company. o Proof of being an entity qualified to purchase Conservation Helium at this sale as defined in Consideration of Offers. Documents such as invoices for sale or purchase of helium, Helium Storage Contracts, or other relevant documents may be submitted as proof of qualification. o The amount (in Mcf) of Conservation Helium requested. o Certified check or money order in the amount of $1,000 made payable to the Bureau of Land Management. This money will be used to cover administrative expenses to conduct this sale and is nonrefundable. o The above information only needs to be submitted the first time a prospective purchaser submits a bid. o Prospective purchasers are not required to submit bids every quarter and may participate in only the quarterly sales they deem appropriate. 3 Consideration of Offers Any person, firm, partnership, joint stock association, corporation, or other domestic or foreign organization operating partially or wholly within the United States who meets one or more of the following requirements is qualified to submit a purchase request: o Operates a helium purification plant within the U.S., or o Operates a crude helium extraction plant within the U.S., or o Is a wholesaler of pure helium or purchases helium for resale within the U.S., or o Is a consumer of pure helium within the U.S., or o Has an agreement with a helium refiner to provide its helium processing needs, commonly referred to as a "tolling agreement." All entities requesting participation in the Non-Allocated Sale must submit proof of being qualified to purchase Conservation Helium and must either have a Helium Storage Contract with the BLM or have a third party agreement in place with a valid storage contract holder so that all Conservation Helium sold to the Bidder will be properly covered by a Helium Storage Contract (including associated storage charges). Payment The successful purchaser will send to the BLM a request for transfer of purchased helium for the following month on or before the 15th day of the current month. Upon receipt of the transfer request, the BLM will invoice the purchaser for the requested amount. The purchased helium will be transferred to the purchaser's or third party storage account on the first day of the month following receipt of payment. Receipt of payment is due not later than 30 days after the BLM receives the request for transfer. Additionally, the purchaser is required to pay for the full amount of the quarterly helium purchase according to the following schedule: o First Quarter request by December 20, 2006 o Second Quarter request by March 20, 2007 o Third Quarter request by June 20, 2007 o Fourth Quarter request by September 20, 2007 Make checks payable to the address above. Allocated Sale Those who meet the definition of Crude Helium Refiners are allowed to purchase Conservation Helium in the allocated sale portion of this sale. An allocated sale is that portion of the annual sale volume of Conservation Helium that is set aside for purchase by the Crude Helium Refiners. The amount of conservation helium available for the allocated sale will be 95 percent of the total volume of the Annual Conservation Helium Sale - 1,990 MMcf, or 497,500 MCF per quarter. 4 The apportionment of the Conservation Helium will be apportioned to each Crude Helium Refiner based on their percentage share (rounded to the nearest 1/10th of 1 percent) of the total refining capacity as of October 1, 2000 connected to the BLM crude helium pipeline. If a refiner or refiners request an amount other than their share of what is offered for sale then: o Any helium not sold during the First, Second, or Third Quarter sales will be carried over to the succeeding Quarter and reallocated. o If one or more refiners request less than their allocated share, any other refiner(s) that requested more than their share will be allowed to purchase the excess volume based on proportionate shares of remaining refining capacities. o Requests by the Crude Helium Refiners that are in excess of the amount available above will be carried over to the Non-Allocated Sale and considered a separate bid under the Non-Allocated Sale rules. Any excess volume not sold to the Crude Helium Refiners will be added to the Non-Allocated Sale volume. Below is a hypothetical example of how an Allocated Sale would be conducted. 525,000 Mcf available for total sale with 95 percent available for Allocated Sale (497,500 Mcf). Bidder - Allocated Sale Installed refining capacity Refiner bid volume* Allocated volume* Excess volume requested* Proration percent Excess Allocated* Total Allocated * Carry over to Non- Allocated Sale* Refiner A 10 % 56,250 49,750 6,500 20 % 6,500 56,250 0 Refiner B 50 % 187,500 187,500 0 0 % 0 187,500 0 Refiner C 40 % 260,000 199,000 61,000 80 % 54,750 253,750 6,250 Total 100 % 503,750 436,250 67,500 100 % 61,250 497,500 0 * All volumes in Mcf After the initial allocation, Refiner B has received all requested. However, 67,500 Mcf is deemed excess of the total in the first iteration of the Allocated Sale and reallocated to the two remaining refiners based on the refining capacity between them. With the reallocation, Refiner A gets all requested, but Refiner C is still short by 6,250 Mcf, which is posted into the Non-Allocated Sale. All percentages used in the calculation will be rounded to the nearest 1/10th of 1 percent. All volumes calculated will be rounded to the nearest 1 Mcf. 5 Non-Allocated Sale The non-allocated sale is that portion of the annual sale volume of Conservation Helium that will be offered to all qualified Bidders. The minimum volume that can be requested is 5 MMcf. The total volume of Conservation Helium available for the non-allocated portion of the quarterly sale is 27,500 Mcf per quarter plus any additional helium that is not sold as part of the Allocated Sale. The ratio of Allocated to Non-Allocated Sale volumes are determined according to the terms of the HPA, the BLM must conduct the Annual Conservation Helium Sales in a manner not to cause undue helium market disruptions; and therefore, the majority of the Conservation Helium is being offered as part of the Allocated Sale. Currently, the Crude Helium Refiners have refining capacity roughly double what can be supplied through the Annual Conservation Helium Sales. Although there are other crude helium supplies available to the Crude Helium Refiners, these supplies are declining each year. The BLM must be sensitive to the Crude Helium Refiners requirements while maintaining a balance with other helium industry requirements. The exact ratio of Allocated to Non-Allocated Sale volumes may change for subsequent Annual Conservation Helium Sales. The Conservation Helium will be apportioned equally in 1 Mcf increments among the Bidders with no prospective Bidder receiving more than its request. If a request is made for more than what is made available for sale then: o If one or more Bidders request less than their apportioned amount, any other Bidder(s) that requested more than its apportioned amount will be allowed to purchase equally apportioned amounts of the remaining volume available for this sale. o If all Bidders request more than their apportioned amount each Bidder will receive its apportioned. o Any bidder requesting less than the calculated apportioned volume will receive the amount of their request and amounts remaining will be reapportioned. Below is a hypothetical example of a Non-Allocated Sale. 525 MMcf available for total sale with 5 percent available for Non-Allocated Sale (27,500 Mcf). Bidder - Non- Allocated Sale Bid volume* Apportioned volume* Excess volume requested* Proration percent Excess Apportioned * Total Apportioned * Amount requested not received* Refiner C 6,250 6,250 0 0 % 0 6,250 0 Company D 20,000 6,875 13,125 50 % 1,750 8,625 11,375 Company E 15,000 6,875 8,125 50 % 1,750 8,625 6,375 Company F 4,000 4,000 0 0 % 0 4,000 0 Total 45,250 24,000 21,250 100 % 3,500 27,500 17,750 * All volumes in Mcf 6 In this example, three companies submit a request and there is a carryover amount from one of the Crude Helium Refiners in the Allocated Sale that is considered as a separate request. Each Bidder would be apportioned 6,875 Mcf, (i.e., 27,500 Mcf of Non- Allocated Conservation Helium ÷ 4 Bidders = 6,875Mcf per Bidder). After the initial allocation, Companies C and F have received all the helium they requested. However, 3,500 Mcf is deemed excess in the first iteration of the Non- Allocated Sale and reallocated to the two remaining Bidders. With the reallocation, Company D and E each receives an additional 1,750 Mcf. No more helium is available, Company D and E do not receive all that they requested, and the sale is complete. All percentages used in the calculation will be rounded to the nearest 1/10th of 1 percent. All volumes calculated will be rounded to the nearest 1 Mcf. Liquidated Damages The BLM must receive payment for helium purchased by a company during a quarterly offering before the company is allowed to purchase additional helium under the rules of this IFO. Additionally, the company will be assessed penalty interest in accordance with the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 951-953 for payments received after the due dates for full payment listed in the "Payment" section.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of purchasing a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements in regard to contractual obligations concerning the lease and building property management office’s approval of the installation of the High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System in SA-34, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  Equipment listed above is required to provide maximum warehousing capabilities in a limited space to support the Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems installations, modifications, and moves worldwide. The Installations Branch has painstakingly complied with Boston Properties requirements with regard to the National Office Systems’ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System as designed for this specific government leased location. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL presented a design for a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System for SA-34 (7374 Boston Blvd, Springfield, VA) to Boston Properties Management Office for approval as a modification to a building or office space managed by Boston Properties on May 5, 2006.  Because Boston Properties has approved the original design submittal; there are Fairfax County Building Permits to obtain and County Codes to adhere to; and the lengthy process and inspection procedures involved with the installation of a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System – the National Office Systems’ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System should be purchased as currently approved by Boston Properties.   The purchase of a nearly comparable rolling warehouse rack system or substitute may be cause to restart the approval process from the beginning and delay the county permit issuance and inspection processes.

In the past, vendors have supplied substitute components, which in their opinion would provide the same function, the specific components are utilized to duplicate devices used by specific terrorist groups.  The in-country instructors will spend additional hours (days) searching the unfamiliar host country for the components, bartering for an acceptable price, thus utilizing time that could be more productive in other areas of course preparation.  This results in wasted man hours and additional funding for the replacement components.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number 2006-Q-09103 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). RFQ 2006-Q-09103 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. The associated NAICS code is 517910 and the small business size standard is annual revenue no greater than $13,500,000.00. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all offers received within fifteen (15) days after date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) project is a public health initiative whose aim is to provide a standards-based, integrated approach to disease surveillance by connecting public health surveillance to the burgeoning clinical information systems infrastructure. The goal of the system is to improve the nation?s ability to identify and track emerging infectious diseases, investigate outbreaks, and monitor disease trends. The inability of public health stakeholders to overcome the complexities and technical challenges associated with today?s electronic message requirements has been deemed the industry?s primary hurdle in accomplishing the goal of exchanging standards-based electronic data between all trading partners. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Public Health Informatics (NCPHI) has a identified a need for the upgrade and further development of the agency?s National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) Messaging Subscription Service (MSS). The Messaging Subscription Service (MSS), a component of the NEDSS?s basic framework, is an independent system, providing electronic messaging and data interchange among system subscribers. The professional services required by this combined synopsis / solicitation are a continuation of previous efforts to adapt commercially available message subscription service software, developed by Emergent Technologies, Inc of 455 South 4th St., Louisville, KY to provide a messaging system capable of supporting multiple client applications for multiple message types. This project will require access to proprietary source code, knowledge of the NEDSS infrastructure and an understanding of NCPHI objectives and operating procedures. To the best of the Government?s knowledge, only Emergent Technologies, Inc possesses the unique proprietary technical knowledge and understanding of NEDSS infrastructure and operational procedures to complete the project. However, any interested party who believes to have the capability to provide the services required by this RFP may submit prices for each of the tasks identified in the following Statement of Work (SOW).
I. STATEMENT OF WORK a. The Contractor will perform the following tasks: 1. Design and develop a MSS Administrator Dashboard that will provide single sign-on access to all MSS applications (i.e. subscription management, vocabulary management, message management and message activity logging). Additionally the ?dashboard? will provide links to external applications and webs (i.e. a link to Public Health Information Network (PHIN) webs or a knowledge base that promotes sharing between MSS users/entities. 2. Design and develop a Vocabulary Management User Interface that provides local code and value set maintenance and mappings, links to CDC PHIN Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (VADS) provisioning, and a visual thesaurus to support researching concepts and codes. The interface will handle configuration of the Vocabulary Validation services in the Rhapsody Electronic Labortory Reporting (ELR) Route. Provide online help user documentation. 3. Enhance the Subscription Management User Interface and Service Plug-in to provide a more robust subscription management capability. This includes: (a) allowing establishment of criteria by visual methods, (b) creating an administrator interface that allows for visual maintenance of message/schema elements, (c) offers role-base security to allow for subscription management delegation and enhanced data privacy/protecting, (d) includes more capable Boolean logic, such as ?OR? conditions and list lookups, and (e) supports exporting and importing of subscriptions. 4. Enhance Message Management to allow message archive lookups and extracts to provide replay and retrospective operations, such as processing archived messages when a new program area module is brought online. Enhance the move functionality to allow batch movement of messages. Add functionality to delete messages from a JMS queue to include logging functionality that allows for retrieval for online help user documentation. 5. Enhance the NEDSS PAM (Program Area Module) Platform (NPP) ELR Route in Rhapsody to utilize a single output JMS CommPoint versus PAM-specific CommPoints to minimize CommPoint consumption and prevent the requirement to update the route each time a new PAM comes on line. Also, add functionality to the route, most likely a custom filter, to allow for dynamic association of incoming messages to the appropriate mapper process. Again, this will prevent having to update the route when new laboratory messages are brought on line. Build a SMTP sender component to allow for email alerts and eliminate the need for Rhapsody CommPoint consumption. 6. Add online help documentation for the Message Activity web application. 7. Enhance the user interface and functionality associate with message translation. Enhancement will permit the user to easily associate a message format to a string of elements, or registers that the MSS consumes. The output of this association is appropriately formatted outbound messages.
8. Add MSS Security Management capability that provides, at a minimum, user access tracing that captures the person ID for modifications that may be made to the mappings or data as it passes through the MSS. b. The Contractor will provide deliverables in accordance with the following Schedule of Delivery: 1. MSS Administrator Dashboard due on or before 30 November 2006 2. Vocabulary Management GUI due on or before 31 December 2006 3. Subscription Management GUI / Service Plug-in due on or before 31 December 2006 4. Message Management Enhancement(s) due on or before 28 February 2007 5. NPP ELR Route due on or before 30 November 2006 6. Message Activity Web Application Online Help Documentation due on or before 31 January 2007 7. Message Translation GUI Enhancement(s) due on or before 30 November 2006 8. Security Management due on or before 31 March 2007 II.

Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical acceptability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.

BRAND NAME DOCUMENTATION
(For Under $100K)

1.  Identify the DISA activity acquiring the product or service and the geographical area. 
		USAFE CSS/SCML, Germany			
2.  Describe the supplies and/or services being procured. 
The items being procured are Eltek Energy Direct Current Rectifiers and associated supporting equipment including the following: thirty (30) amp circuit breakers, ten (10) amp circuit breakers, one (1) distribution chassis, and one (1) chassis cover to convert alternate current (AC) power to direct current (DC) power.
3.  Provide the rationale, supporting the brand name acquisition.  Justify the use of Brand Name only.
The requested equipment is part of an ongoing MAJCOM-wide TCF Modernization Program and will be an extension of 20 previously purchased and installed pieces of equipment throughout the European theater. As such, award of another brand would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. These costs include re-engineering, re-certification, additional equipment for spare and retraining of Government personnel on newly acquired non-standard equipment. Therefore, the purchase of other brand equipment would add unforeseen costs to the overall TCF Upgrade Program. The Eltek product ensures consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use and interoperability.
If expertise is the basis for the brand name determination, structure the justification as follows: 
	a.  Explain why a particular expertise or level of expertise is critical to this acquisition. 
	N/A	
b.  Provide evidence that the contractor is the only source, and possesses the required expertise. 
	N/A
c.  Describe or explain the impact in terms of feasibility, time, and cost of educating another
contractor to reach an equivalent level of expertise. 
	N/A
4.  Lack of advance planning and funding availability by the requiring activity is not a sufficient justification for brand name procurement?
	
a.  Identify, when the procurement first became known? 
	09 Aug 06
b.  Justify why the time schedule is critical to the organization?s needs, and mission, and state
    the specific critical dates that materially affect the acquisition. 
	N/A
c.  Describe the impact on the organization and or it?s mission if the schedule is not met. 
N/A

<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, Salt Lake City, Utah has a requirement drill seeding approximately 1,552 acres located on 2 project areas in the Moab Field Office area. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this notice is RFQ JSQ064170.  STATEMENT OF WORK: 1)  DRILL SEEDING (IN STRIPS) - STATEMENT OF WORK	  Contractor to furnish labor, equipment (tractors), supplies, and materials, except for specified Government-furnished property, to plant seed with rangeland drills.  Materials shall comply with or conform to the specifications and the Contractor shall satisfy himself as to the kind and amount of work that may be necessary in furnishing the materials. 2)   LOCATION:  Work under this Contract is located on two project areas within the Moab Field Office of the BLM.  The 1,128 acre Westwater II project is located approximately 6 miles south of Interstate 70 and 5 miles west of the Colorado/Utah border. The 424 acre Bryson Wash project is located approximately 3 miles north of Interstate 70 and 5 miles west of the Colorado/Utah border. The work sites are located in Grand County, as shown on the location map. There are 2 treatment areas.   1) Westwater II project is approximately 1,128 acres (T20S, R25E, Sec. 29,30). 2) Bryson Wash project is approximately 424 acres (T19S, R25E, Sec's. 22, 23, 26, 27). Total Acres:  Drill seeding on approximately 1,552 acres.  The distance between Westwater II and Bryson Wash is approximately 15 miles. Movement between the treatment areas is on paved and dirt roads. 3)	  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/SCHEDULE OF WORK:   The Performance Time will commence on the day specified in the Notice to Proceed and will be calculated according to the following formula: 11ft x 7 hr/day x 3 mi/hr x 5,280ft/mi x acre/43,560 sq ft = 28 acre/day 	The formula assumes: 1 drill with 11 ft swath 7 hours per day of actual drill operation Operation at speed of 3 mph Seeding to occur throughout 100% of the ground within the treatment unit boundaries.  Due to topography and limited areas for turning, seeding will normally require single drill usage.  Therefore, time was figured on average of 1 drill width - approximately 11 feet.  Due to staubs, litter, slow speed, some tire problems and routine adjustment of drills seed rate, the average rate per tractor/drill combination(s) is 28 acres per day.  The 28 acre per day figure is the typical production expected from a single tractor and operator.  Additional tractors specified by and working on the same project should produce an additional 28 acres per day each.  Due to the time-sensitive nature of the work the Contractor may be required to operate seven days per week in order to complete the project in the allotted Performance Time. For these projects, 2 drills are available:  1,552 acres/56 acres per day (28 acres x 2 available drills) = 28 days.  Additional time allowed due to contingency and movement = 10 days.  This project is to be complete 28 work days after award no later than December 15, 2006. 4)  PROJECT/ SITE CONDITIONS a)  Access to the Work Site:   i.

Description of full-size Rangeland Drill: a.	One rangeland drill is a 1950's John Deere Model B 10 x 6 grain boxes, feeds, drives and related components.   One rangeland drill is a 1960's John Deere Model PD 10 x 6 grain boxes, feeds, drives and related components. b.	The main grain boxes are closely joined at the center of Model PD and spaced about 5 inches apart on the Model B. c.	The Model PD has a clutch and clutch throwout lever at each outer drive chain case.  The Model B has a gear engagement and disengagement arrangement at each outer drive in place of a clutch. d.	The drill has a high-center frame for clearing obstacles and is mounted on two large wheels with pneumatic tires or steel wheels.  The main frame is a heavily constructed, all-welded assembly.  Older models have a fixed tongue or drawbar.  Later models have a drawbar designed to fold back over the top of the feed box and lock to the rear frame member.  The purpose of this feature is to facilitate transportation. e.	Two large seed boxes, or hoppers, are mounted on top of the main frame and have adjustable flute feeds with seed agitators.  The hoppers, including the feed systems, clutches, and most of the drive mechanisms, are modified for adaptation to the rangeland drill. f.	Two groups of five disc opener arms are arranged to cast soil toward the drill center and equalize disc thrust.  The disc arms are spaced 12 inches apart and attach to the front, mainframe, cross-member with hinge pins to allow for movement over obstructions such as rocks.  Guards on the underside and in front of the disc minimize brush clogging.  When required, such as in sandy type soils, an 18-inch depth ring controls seed planting depth. Spindles are also provided for adding weights to increase disc penetration when depth rings are not used.  Seed row spacing is 12 inches for a total effective seeding width of 10 feet.

Lubrication and Servicing Equipment: a.	Contractor shall lubricate and service drills and their component parts at mid-day and the end of each shift.  Contractor shall furnish necessary lubricating equipment and proper lubricants.  Contractor shall check bolts and nuts on the machines periodically and no less than twice daily to insure tightness and shall tighten them as necessary for proper maintenance.  Contractor shall also frequently inspect and readjust as necessary seed dispensing mechanisms to insure calibration rates remain constant during the seed drilling operation. v.	Repairs to Equipment: a.	Contractor shall be equipped to make necessary field repairs to drills.  The Contractor shall maintain and repair the drill(s) at the worksite.  The Government will furnish repair parts necessitated by normal wear and tire repair not due to fault or negligence of the Contractor.  Contractor shall install repair parts furnished by Government for which no separate payment will be made.  Cost of such work will be included in the unit price per acre in the Schedule.  The cost of repairs resulting from fault or negligence of the Contractor shall be borne by Contractor and will be deducted from payments due under the Contract.  With the exception of those repairs resulting from fault or negligence of the Contractor, major repairs not repairable in the field will be made by the Government.  No alterations or modifications of rangeland drills shall be made without approval of the Contracting Officer; however, occasional adjustments in component parts of drills may be made by the Contractor as necessary to maintain proper operation.  Worn or broken parts (as furnished by the Government), replaced by the Contractor, shall be kept for inspection by the Contracting Officer. vi.	Operating Hints a.	Before Field Use: 1.	Contractor must be familiar with the rangeland drill by studying the San Dimas Equipment Center's Instruction Manual to become familiar with intended use and all phases of lubrication, service and maintenance requirements. 2.	Adjust hitches so that drills remain level when towed. 3.	Thoroughly check drill to see that all pins, bolts and adjustments are secure, and that it is completely lubricated with the proper lubricants. 4.	Determine intended direction of turn.  This may vary with different hitches or drill carts.  Improper turning may cause severe damage due to ride-up or drills hitting each other. 5.	Be sure the seeding mechanism including agitator assembly, seed feeds and seed tubes are clean and operating freely before filling hoppers.  This is particularly important to prevent breakage when the drill has been in storage or in wet freezing weather.  Proper operation can be determined by: a.	Jacking up and turning the wheels with drill in gear.  If climbing under the drill, contractor must insure the stability of the drill/ b.	Using a wrench to rotate the square feed shaft located under the seed hoppers in either direction with the drill out of gear. b.  Field Operations: 	1.  Check seed feed openings and seed tubes frequently.  Be sure these are clean, open and free of trash or other foreign objects. 	2.  Lubricate with proper lubricant at regular intervals.  A good practice is to lubricate at noon and upon quitting when everything is warm, rather than prior to starting work in the morning.  During longer days (12 to 14 hours), three lubes may be necessary. 	c.	Common Problem Areas Resulting in High Repair Costs, Excessive Down Time and/or Poor Seeding Operations:	 1.  Speed:  Pull drills 2 to 4 miles per hour.  Decrease speed in rough going or when obstructions are encountered.  Pulling the drills at double the recommended speed generally results in at least three times the maintenance and repair costs; and where obstructions exist such as rocks, brush, etc., "skips" will occur resulting in a poor seeding.   During cold weather, considerations should be given to reducing drill speed to two miles per hour.  Higher speed or frozen ground increases the rate of breakage to equipment. 2.  Use of Disc-Arm Assembly Chains: 	These chains have two functions: 	a.	Raising and holding the disc arms during transportation in the field. 	b.	Preventing the disc arm from dropping and allowing the flexible seed tube to be pulled out of the metal seed tube.  When the drill is in operation, the chain should be fully extended and firmly attached to the disc arm and to the drill frame. 		3.   Moving Drills to the Field:  The disc arms must be securely chained up, the feed mechanism taken out of gear, weights must be removed and drags must be removed or wired up.  Excessive speed or hard bumps may break the chains and let the arms fall. 4.   Backing Drills:  Drills must not be backed up while attached to a drill cart as it is impossible to control them.  Breakage or bending of drills and carts could occur.  If limited backing is necessary such as in loading or when stuck, the drills must be backed separately.  The arms must be raised to prevent plugging seed tubes, drags laid across arms to prevent breakage or loss, and the feed mechanism disengaged to prevent breakage.  If backing up is absolutely necessary, never back any drill or vehicle until absolutely sure there is no object, other vehicle, or person behind.  Always have spotter to direct backing operations. 5.  Crossing Deep Draws:  When crossing draws, speed must be reduced.  The operator must watch for: a.  The change of angle caused by the cart coming out of the draw with the  drill still in it causes a prying action between the cart and the tongue.  This often causes breakage or bending damage to the hitch. b.  If the disc arm drops rapidly into the draw without hitting the bottom, the arm chain will frequently break and let the seed tube pull out. 6.  Wearing of Disc and Disc-Opener Shaft:  If the bearing is loose or worn, the shaft will wear.  If the disc is loose, the shaft and the hole in the disc will wear.  When depth bands are not used, use a spacer washer to permit tightening the nut that holds the disc on the shaft.  Make sure this nut stays high and the snap ring stays in place.  Rocks catching between the arms can dislodge either. 7.  All nuts and bolts must be kept tight.  Any looseness will cause holes to wear oblong, bolts to shear, nuts to come off, causing serious breakage or damage. 8.  Lost Drag Chains:  If the operator watches, most drag chains that are lost can be picked up on the next round. 9.  Cleaning Seed Boxes:  Upon completion of drilling operations, clean the seed boxes and seed feeds thoroughly.  Scoop out and resack seed left in boxes; then set the feed adjustment wide open and pull the drills until empty of seed. vii.	Field Repairs: a.	DO NOT weld the snap ring on the disc opener shaft.  Any subsequent repair generally requires replacing the shaft, one of the major expenses in drill repair. The snap rings, if properly installed and checked regularly, will adequately keep the shaft in place.  The ring has to be properly installed so as not to distort its tension.  It can be installed easily and quickly by driving it over the end of the shaft with a home made tool such as a short piece of pipe with an inside diameter that will just fit over the outside of the shaft. Use the correct snap ring.  Original shafts had round snap ring grooves, later ones have square-sided grooves.  The snap rings do their job well when the right ones are properly installed in the respective grooves. b.	DO NOT weld seed tubes to the disc arm assemblies.  In making the repairs to bring the drill back to standard, it is necessary to replace the seed tube.  Cutting and welding on the arm assembly weakens it and often misalignment occurs.  This causes further damage to other parts. c.	DO NOT weld the arm pins to the anchor blocks on the drill frame.  These are specially constructed pins, locked in place by a 3/8" x 3-1/2" bolt.  When these have to be cut out with a torch, it is sometimes necessary to replace the anchor block on the frame.  This is a time consuming and expensive operation. d.	DO NOT use under-size pins in place of the original arm pins.  The slack causes wear on the anchor blocks.  These will then have to be replaced. e.	DO NOT weld drive gears and clutch together.  This makes it impossible to throw the drive mechanism out of gear or let the ratchet work properly when the drill is backed. f.	In the event of any breakage in the frame, assure correct alignment before repair

I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

The Justice Program Advisor will work with the U.S. Embassy to Afghanistan and the INL Bureau to create and implement U.S. foreign policy directives regarding the rebuilding of the justice sector in Afghanistan, focusing specifically on criminal justice and corrections.  

Background

INL manages justice programs in Afghanistan totaling around $30 million annually.  The management of a complex program of that size and importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires someone with significant management and legal expertise to develop, monitor and troubleshoot all aspects of the program.

General Program Description

The INL Afghanistan Justice Advisor will provide advice and assistance to ensure the successful implementation of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Afghanistan. The justice advisor will be a member of the Embassy Special Committee on Rule of Law and will represent INL?s justice programs to senior U.S., international and Afghan officials.  

INL is responsible for implementing U.S. foreign assistance programs designed to complement Afghan and international efforts to reestablish Afghanistan?s justice sector.  Program activities include institutional capacity building; professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives; fostering coordination within the criminal justice system especially between police, prosecutors, courts and prisons; creating conditions in which Afghan Constitutional and international human rights guarantees can be upheld; and extending the formal justice system throughout the country while working with the traditional systems to increase public awareness and access to justice. 

To achieve these goals, the Justice Advisor must be able to effectively oversee three major contracted programs and possibly more in the future including (1) the Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP) with around 20 U.S. and Afghan justice advisors and security and support staff in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-sharif and Jalalabad, (2) the Corrections System Support Program (CSSP) with around 20 U.S. corrections advisors and security and support staff, and (3) the LLM program, a grant with a U.S. University which is bringing about 20 Afghan law professors to the U.S. to earn LLM degrees.  

The Justice Advisor will also be responsible for assisting and overseeing smaller grant programs and developing new initiates in coordination with the Embassy and INL Washington.  The Justice Advisor will ensure that these programs are being effectively implemented, meet the needs and goals of the Afghan Government, are coordinated with the international community and NATO forces, and are briefed to senior U.S. Embassy and visiting officials.   

The Justice Advisor will also ensure that INL Washington receives timely information and reporting to ensure that senior Department, Interagency and Budget briefings are fully informed of developments on the ground.  The Justice Advisor will work with in-country and Washington-based contract officer-designates in addition to working with the program office in Washington, DC.  However, the Justice Advisor?s direct chain of command is through the U.S. Embassy INL Section to the U.S. Ambassador.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency located in Montgomery,Alabama is seeking a quote from interested parties in providing mixed gamma reference standards containing an approximate total radioactivity of 200 nanocuries each.
1.  Intended use: The standards will be owned by EPA, but will be possessed and used by a variety of individuals and/or organizations at various geographic locations in the United States and it territories, who do not have a specific license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or an Agreement State to possess or use radioactive materials.  
2.  Radionuclides: The standards are to be prepared with a mixture of radionuclides with half lives of no less than 100 days, that collectively emit at least eight gamma rays at discrete energies that do not interfere with each other, nominally covering the energy range of 50 to 2000 KeV.   Typical sodium iodide detector resolution may be assumed, and interfering gammas.  No alpa-emitting radionuclides are permitted in the standards.   The radionuclides used in the mixture must individually and collectively qualify for exempt quantity designation under Part C, Appendix B of the Council of Radiation Control Program Directors Suggested State Regulations for Control of Radiation, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations in 10 CFR 30.71 Schedule B (attached), whichever is more restrictive.   The following mixture is preferred; however, alternate mixtures may be proposed provided that they meet the above requirements: a)Pb-210-approximately 80nCi; b) Cd-109-approximately 60nCi; c) Co-57-approximately 4.5 nCi; d) Ce-139-approximately 5.5 nCi; e) Sn-113-approximately 16 nCi; f)Cs-137-approximately 5.5nCi; g) Y-88-approximately 16nCi; h)Co-60-approximately 9 nCi
3.  Transportation requirements.  Each standard must also conform to the conditions and limitations specified in 49 CFR 173.421 for exempted package-limited quantity of material.   In evlauating conformance to the package dose rate limits of these regulations, it may be assumed that the standard will be packaged such the minimum distance from any surface of the source to the outside of the package is at least three inches.
4.  Physical requirements: The radioactive material shall be uniformly deposited on a 3.25 inch diameter area polyester filter paper.   The filter paper willbe provided by the EPA.  The filter paper should then be sealed or encapsulated with plastic tape or film, or other suitable material, to prevent contact with or loss of radioactive material when handled exercising reasonable care to prevent damage.  The final finished diameter of the standards shall be 4 inches, and the finished thickness shall not be more than 1/16" greater than the clean filter media provided by EPA for making the standards.
5.  Calibration certificate: A certificate must be provided for each standard that specifies the quantity of each radioistope contained therein, as well as the uncertainty of that quantity and the date of assay.  Units may be in curies or bequerels or any combination of the preceding.   The certificate must clearly communicate what values are certified, and must list the nuclear data references used for obtaining half lives or branching ratios used in deriving any information presented on the certificate that is calculated rather than directly measured.
6. Traceability of calibration: Calibration of the standards must be traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or the National Standards Body of a country recognized by NIST through international agreement.

This is a fixed price contract. NAIC Code: 541380, Size Standard:  $11 Million
Delivery Requirements:  Standards must be delivered within
six-weeks after date of award.

The following questions were asked at our 17 Aug 06 site visit.  Once the answers are received, they will also be posted.

1.	Section 2.1.1 shows 2 wireless lapel mics, and 6 handheld wireless mics, but only 6 receivers. Are the lapel mics and two of the handheld mics to share a receiver? If so, they cannot be used at the same time ? only a total of 6 wireless mics can be used at once. The system will require two additional receivers to use all 8 mics at once. 
2.	Section 2.1.2 appears to be for the equipment rack, but it also has 4 monitor speakers there. Are these the stage monitors, to be installed at the stage, or are they to be used at the equipment rack area? If so, any specifications for these? The EV QRx112/75 specified in the next section can be used as a stage monitor. 
3.	Section 2.1.2.1 has the EV QRx112/75 listed as 4 surround speakers, but they do not match or meet the specifications listed. Is there a different model speaker to be installed? 
4.	Section 2.1.2.2 lists a subwoofer. The model that meets those specifications is a Klipsch KPT-684 ? except it is a dual 18? model. There is no model which meets the specifications in a single 18? K-47 woofer. OK to change to a dual sub model? 
5.	2.1.2.4 is for an audio/video receiver. There are already 3 amplifiers in the system. Is this to be used as the main amp for the 4 main speakers, with two of the three other amps used for the monitors, and the third used for the subwoofer? Please clarify the intended use of the power amplifiers. 
6.	2.1.2.5 lists an I.O. processor. The specifications appear to be for a discontinued EV model. The current model is not the same. We can meet or exceed the spec?s with a different make and model (Symetrix Sym-net). This OK? Also, at the bottom, it says to be capable of receiving 16 channel mixing board audio output from band. Is this a separate mixer from the 32x4 channel one requested in 2.1.2.7? 
7.	2.1.2.5 Lists an I/O expander. The specifications are exactly the same as the I/O processor. Please clarify what type of expander this is - additional inputs, or additional outputs? 
8.	2.2.6 The scaler/switcher specified is a Kramer VP-723DS or VP-724DS. Both have been discontinued. Replaced by VP-724xl, which has slightly different specifications. Functionality is the same, however. OK to use replacement? 
9.	2.2.8 Specifications are for a Kramer TP-100 transmitter. A better model would be the TP-104, which has enough CAT-5 outputs for the three projectors. 
10.	2.2.9 Specifications are exactly the same as 2.2.8. I assume a TP-200 receiver was wanted here, but there are three projectors. A better choice would be three TP-120 receivers. 
11.	2.2.12 What is Optical video out? 
12.	On site, we had discussed the mixing board to be located at the operators station some distance away from the stage. Are the only input to this board to be the 6 wireless mics? What about any instruments at the stage? If hardwired connections from the stage are to be provided, how many are needed? Should they go into the walls, or a stage pocket? We also discussed an additional PC input, located in the front at the podium. Should we propose this as an add alt?

<ARCHDATE>08252007
<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE CALL 801-539-4177 FOR MAPS Continuation of Statement of Work and Clauses and Provision f.	In the event of any breakage in the frame, assure correct alignment before repairing.  Improper alignment causes additional wear, breakage and repair costs. viii.	Recommended Tool Parts for Field Repairs: a.	Tools:  A fairly complete toolbox with sockets, snap ring pliers, and wrenches, crescent wrenches, pliers and mechanic's hammer should be maintained by the contractor at the seeding site.  In addition, the operator should have a five-foot bar, aligning bar, lifting equipment (at least a handy man jack), a welder and the necessary lubrication equipment. b.	Drill Repair Kits (to be furnished by the government) containing items for Emergency Field Repairs on Drills: 	2 - one kit for each available drill  	2 -- tires for drills An assortment of bar iron of various sizes for repairing and reinforcing breaks.  An assortment of cotter keys, bolts, nuts and grease fittings (same size and type as original).  It is recommended to have some 36-inch fence stays on hand to clean seed tubes with.  They are twisted and will clean much better than straight wire. ix.	Drill Calibration: a.	After presetting for desired seeding rates, all drills require calibration to insure desired seeding rates are achieved.  Seed size, weight, mixture and dryness as well as degree of processing and amount of trash present affect seeding rates. b.	There are a number of methods of calibrating drills for seeding a given number of pounds of seed per acre.  The following methods are recommended: 1.	 1.	Run the drill over a canvas or firm surface with the drill in gear.  Count the number of seeds per row foot of any one of the species in the mixture.  Base your count on the average of at least three, five-foot, sections of drill row.  Compare the average number of seeds drilled with the number the desired seeding rate provides.  Be sure to take into account the particular row spacing being used.  Make the necessary adjustments in the drill setting and repeat the operation until the desired seeding rate is obtained. 2.	Calibration in the shop - Jack up and block the drill so that the wheels turn freely and place a canvas under the seed tubes.  Fill the hopper with the desired seed mix and set the seed regulator at the desired drilling rate.  Rotate the wheel until the land measurer registers the predetermined acreage to be covered in the trial.  Gather and weigh the seed collected from canvas, calculate rate per acre and adjust feed rate accordingly.  As a double check on the land measurer, (these frequently are, or become, inaccurate) you could count the revolutions and multiply by wheel circumference to determine area.  Seed can also be caught in pans and bags. 3.	Since the vibration of drills and seed tubes in the field affect rate of seeding, it is preferable to calibrate in the field under typical use conditions including speed of travel. 4.	In the field, seed a predetermined small acreage using measured area or lineal drill seeding length converted to acres.  Determine amount of seed use and adjust desired rate. The following formula can be used in calibrating a drill in the field. 			Lbs. Per acre of seed planted = 	43,560 x lbs. Seed collected 						Drill width in ft. x strip length in ft. 5.	A good rule of thumb is one set of drills will use a sack (50 pounds) of crested wheat grass seed an hour at three miles per hour.  This will give approximately seven pounds per acre. Time would have to be adjusted if a different rate were desired. 6.	When there is trouble in calibration of a drill, look at the slack in the feed roll cups and gate.  Often this can be taken up.  Loosen the nuts on the bottom of the cups and adjust the cups so that the rollers are all exposed the same distance. 7.	DO NOT STAND OR RIDE ON DRILLS WHILE THEY ARE IN MOTION. 11)	SEEDING SPECIFICATIONS: i.	Surface Conditions:  Seed shall not be drilled under conditions when it cannot be properly covered with soil such as when the ground is frozen.  If such conditions are encountered in the seeding operations, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer within 24 hours. ii.	Protection:  The Contractor is required to protect section corners, bench marks, and other markers and stakes from damage or removal.  In case of destruction or removal by the Contractor, they will be replaced by the Government and the actual cost for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor. iii.	Direction of Seeding:  Seeding shall be done on the contour, either as marked by the Government or using equipment contour levels.  If contour levels are used, they shall be the equivalent of the Cherokee Scout Level as manufactured by Craft and Carlson Manufacturing Company, Cherokee, Iowa. iv.	Rate of Seeding:  Seed shall be distributed at the rate of 16 bulk pounds per acre for the Bryson Wash project area and 14 bulk pounds per acre for the Westwater II project area.  Each treatment area has been recently burned and should be void of vegetation. v.	Average Depth of Seeding:  ? to ? inches.  Chain drags may be furnished by the Government when required for coverage. vi.	Protection of Seed:  Contractor shall load and transport Government-furnished seed from the pickup point to the worksites and be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or other hazard.  Seed damaged or lost while in custody of Contractor will be replaced by the Government and the actual cost for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  Unused seed shall be returned to the location designated in Section 01019- Government-Furnished Property, upon completion of work or termination of Contract.  Empty seed bags shall be saved and returned to the Government. vii.	Method of Measurement (Units):  Seeding will be measured and paid for by the number of acres seeded.  Acreage measurements will be based on horizontal distances measured from by the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS) viii.	Remeasurement:  Remeasurement of the acreage under this Contract will be made upon the written request of the Contractor.  Request for remeasurement must be made in writing within 10 calendar days after seeding has been completed.  If remeasurement indicates a difference of not more than 5% from the original measurement, the Contractor shall pay the actual cost of the remeasurement.  Payments will be based on the second measurement where the difference between measurements is more than 5%.  Where the difference is less than 5% the results of the first measurement will be used. 12)	SEEDING OPERATION: i.	General:  Rangeland drills are specially adapted for the purpose of seeding rough rangelands under conditions of soil and terrain too severe for standard grain drills.  Principles of drill seeding are followed except that each disc arm is mounted separately and has a floating action which allows each individual disc to work independently. ii.	Seed Opening: Seed dispensing orifices on the drills shall provide even distribution of seed. iii.	Discs:  When inspections of equipment reveal that the disks are not properly operating or feeder tubes are not intact or are blocked by trash, the Contracting Officer may require reseed drilling of that portion of the area determined to be not properly drilled, at no additional cost to the Government. 13)	REFERENCES 1.

Within sixty days after award, the manufacturer shall provide drawings for the two reinforced concrete abutments.  The NPS shall construct the abutments prior to delivery of the bridge superstructure and timber decking materials. The location of the abutments is on existing undisturbed road bed.  The manufacturer shall provide a construction advisor for two days to assist the NPS in the installation and assembly of the bridge. This advisor must be present on a daily basis to ensure that the bridge is installed/erected properly. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:  The bridge shall be designed for dead load plus AASHTO HS20-44 live (truck) loading and for wind load of 40 pounds per square foot, calculated with wind acting on entire bridge vertical face as if it we fully enclosed.

Prior to treatment of timbers, manufacturer shall shape/cut timbers to exact length, so treatment will penetrate all exposed surfaces.  The following guidelines shall be used when treating material: 1) Treat using Copper Naphthenate which meets AWPA P8, Section 2.  The solvent used shall meet the requirements of AWPA Standard P9, Hydrocarbon solvent, Type A or Type C, depending on the product being treated.  2)  Solution Filtration - The Copper Napthenate solution in use shall be filtered or otherwise kept clean regularly to remove solids which may otherwise be deposited on the wood during treating.  3)  Follow good housekeeping practices to minimize sawdust and other surface residues on the wood products prior to treatment.  4)  Expansion Bath - Use a minimum expansion bath of one hour.  The maximum temperature of the expansion bath shall be 220 degrees F or 230 degrees F depending on the specific commodity standard limitations.  The expansion bath shall be followed by a vacuum period using a minimum of 22" for a minimum for a minimum of two hours. Following the vacuum period, the wood shall be subjected to steaming for a two-hour time period.  The minimum temperature during steaming shall be 200 degrees F and the maximum shall be 240 degrees F depending on the species being treated.  After steaming, apply a final vacuum for a minimum of four hours at 22" of vacuum.  Prior to shipment, visually inspect the treated wood product and reject any pieces with excessive surface residue.

Avoid excessive solids or grease-like deposits which can be scraped off the surface.  Also, reject material where liquid preservative "bleeds" from the product.  The NPS shall install the wood decking material according to the manufacturer's drawings and specifications.  The 5-inch continuous steel channel toe plate provided by the manufacturer shall be mounted inside each truss 4 inches above the deck according to the manufacturer's drawings.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate answers to questions received from potential offerors regarding this solicitation, extend the closing date of the combined synopsis/solicitation, implement a closing date for questions and provide clarification as to how prices will be evaluated.

Solicitation 200-2006-18431 is hereby amended as follows:  

?	Answers to questions received for this solicitation are hereby provided. (See below)

?	As a result of changes being made in this amendment, the due date for proposals is hereby extended from 10:00 AM August 29, 2006 to 10:00 AM September 5, 2006. 

?	Inquiries concerning the solicitation document should be submitted in writing to the issuing office.  Any additions, deletions, or changes to the solicitation will be made by an amendment. OFFERORS ARE INSTRUCTED SPECIFICALLY TO CONTACT ONLY THE SOLICITATION CONTRACTING OFFICE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ASPECT OF THIS REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD.

Inquiries should be received at the Contracting Office no later than 	Monday, August 21, 2006, and maybe submitted via e-mail to egz2@cdc.gov.

?	Weighted average unit price method of evaluation will be utilized to evaluate price.  Line items requesting range pricing will be determined utilizing the Weighted Average Unit Price method.  Those with single numeric quantity will be determined by multiplying the quantity with the offeror?s proposed unit price.  This means that a representative percentage will be calculated for each quantity of each drug.  Please note that all percentages will be rounded to the whole percentage and the HIGHEST quantity for each option range will be utilized.  For example, quantities of ****300, 600, and 900 equal a total quantity of 1,800.  The percentage for each quantity is 17%, 33%, and 50% respectively (take each quantity divided by the total quantity).  Then each percentage is multiplied by its respective proposed unit price.  This represents each quantities weighted unit price.  For example, if the unit prices were $5.00, $3.00, and $2.00, respectively, the weighted unit prices will be $.85, $.99, $1.00 respectively.  Please note that all weighted unit prices will be rounded to the whole penny.  The weighted unit price is then multiplied by its respective quantity rounded to the nearest dollar, to get the total price for each quantity.  All prices for all line items will then be added together to determine the total overall evaluated price.  This price will then be utilized to determine the offerors total evaluated price.

?	Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the the combined synopsis/solicitation 200-2006-184231, remains unchanged and in full force and effect.

***1.  Paragraph C.3.6.2 heading, change to read ?Desired Functionality?.

***2.  Paragraph C.3.7 Travel, replace the last sentence in this paragraph with the following:  ?The SEC will not reimburse travel expenses for a Contractor who has an office in the Washington D.C. area; the SEC will only reimburse a non-local Contractor if that Contractor incurs travel expenses that are, or exceed, $200 one-way during a COTR-approved trip.?  The Contractor will be notified at award if they are considered by the SEC to be within the local area or not.

***3.  Paragraph G.6 Progress Payments, replace ?price? for ?cost? wherever ?cost? appears in this paragraph.  Progress payments will be based upon total price.

***4.  Add Paragraph H.6, Press Releases to read as follows:

?H.6  Press Releases

The Contractor shall not release any information regarding their work on, or participation in, this award unless they receive prior written approval from the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall submit their proposed release(s) to the Contracting Officer for review; the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor, in writing, of the results of the review and if approval is given to release the proposed information either partially, in full, or not at all.?

***5.  Paragraph L.6.4.2 Factor 2: Key Personnel, states that the Offeror shall propose at least one key staff member and that a one-page resume must be submitted for that key staff member.  This does not limit the Offeror to only one key staff member.  It does infer that the personnel proposed should be key people.  For each key staff member, a maximum of a one-page resume must be submitted.  If an Offeror proposes three key staff members, then their proposal should include three one-page resumes.
