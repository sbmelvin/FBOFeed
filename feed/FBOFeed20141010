In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The purpose of this project is to repair road infrastructure damaged during the White fire and fire suppression efforts of August 2014. The objective of Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts is to protect public safety and Forest Service investment in road infrastructure by restore traffic signs and improving road surface drainage. Work includes constructing rolling dips, grading roads, cleaning ditches, reconditioning, repairing and cleaning existing drainage structures, installing new drop inlet covers, installing flared end sections on existing culverts, repairing existing gates and installing lock open posts on existing gates. The project is subject to a Limited Operating Period (LOP) where generally no work can commence from October 15th to April 15th.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for data acquisition hardware.  The hardware will interface with the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration Optical Test Set [OTS].

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for Spiral Bevel Gear Set Replacement. <p> NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Arrow Gear Company. Arrow Gear Company is the exclusive manufacturer of the required GRMS Input Spiral Bevel Gear Set as they hold the proprietary software to recreate the summary files required to fabricate these highly specialized gears. Without the propriety software these gears cannot be fabricated. In addition, these gears are required to mate with existing gears in the GRMS transmission. It is imperative the gear set is identical to the existing gear set to maintain compatibility. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required gear set, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. <p> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 10/16/2014.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia 22448-5110 intends to procure (quantity of five) AN/USQ-T48(V) Trainer Simulator/Stimulator Systems (TSSS) units used in the Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system on a sole source basis to AAI Corporation (AAI).
This is a noncommercial procurement.
 AAI is the only qualified source to provide the TSSS hardware. The AAI Corporation AN/USQ-T48(V) Trainer Simulator/Stimulator Systems (TSSS) units used in the Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system were tested extensively and qualified as part of the approved BFTT Navy ships configuration by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, IN, and CDSA Dam Neck, as the BFTT Acquisition Engineering Agent (AEA). The AAI Corporation TSSS are uniquely military items that fill critical support functions in shipboard integrated combat systems training. AAI Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the TSSS units in the approved configuration. There are no known resellers of this OEM product.
 The Government does not possess the design drawings. Only AAI Corporation possesses the design drawings and the software code was developed by AAI at its own private expense for the Digital Radar Landmass Simulator (DRLMS), P/N 33375-70300000-0100.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334111 with a size standard of 1000 people. The closing date is 10:00AM EST on 25 October 2012. The anticipated award date is 12 April 2013. If you have any questions, please send them to alexander.delguidice@navy.mil. Please reference N00178-13-R-1002 on any correspondence

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be soliciting for a Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to GA TELESIS, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  The BOA will provide for the furnishing of labor, material, reports and parts as may be required to restore 6 NIINs to serviceable operating condition on the H-60 helicopter. The BOA will be for a period of five (5) years. This is for year 2 of 5.  The total projected expenditure for the five years total $1.5 million dollars.    Please see attached documentation for exact listing of NIINs.

GA TELESIS (3FZB1) is located in Stratford, CT and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at:

<DESC>FY16-20 60mm/81mm/120mm Mortar Tail Fins (Market Survey): <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI), Rock Island, IL 61299-0001 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS), is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources capable of providing M27, M24 and M28 Mortar Tail Fins. The purpose of this survey is to obtain current information on the capability of small businesses to provide these products to the war fighter in the FY16-FY20 timeframe. <br>   <br> The M27 Mortar Tail Fin supports the 60mm family of High Explosive, Training, Smoke and Illumination Mortar Cartridge Programs.  The M27 fin is 5.40in long and 2.375in in diameter at the fin blades. The fin is made of 2014-T65 or 6070-T6 aluminum (Spec ASTM B221). Six individual blades are extruded at the end of the boom. Each blade is precisely canted at 5 degrees. The center of the fin is hollow and threaded at the end so the M702 Ignition Cartridge can be inserted and secured in the fin. Flash holes are drilled in the hollow section of the boom to vent gas and flame from the M702 Ignition Cartridge.   <br>  <br> The M24 and M28 Mortar Tail Fin Assemblies support the 81mm family of High Explosive, Training, Smoke and Illumination Mortar Cartridge Programs. The assemblies are a two-piece design (fin component pressed fit onto the housing component).  <br>  <br> The M24 assembly is 7.41in long and 3in in diameter at the fin blades.  The M24 fin components are made from Aluminum Alloy (Spec ASTM B221, Hollow Extrusions Not Permitted) and the M24 housing components from Aluminum 7075-T6 (Die Forging, Spec ASTM B247 OR Rod, Spec ASTM-B211 [or B221]).  Both the M24 fin and housing components are also anodized (Finish 7.2.1 of Mil Std 171, shall withstand a 96-hour Salt Spray Test).  Six individual blades are extruded at the end of the boom. Each blade is precisely canted at 5 degrees 17 minutes.  The center of the M24 fin component is hollow and threaded at the end so that the M299 ignition cartridge can be inserted and secured in the fin.  Flash holes are drilled in the hollow section of the boom to vent gas and flame from the M299 Ignition Cartridge.   <br>  <br> The M28 Assembly is 8.545in long and 3.150in in diameter at the fin blades.  The M28 fin components are made from Extruded Aluminum Alloy 2014-T4 (Spec ASTM B221) and the M28 housing components from Aluminum Alloy Bar 7075-T76 (Spec ASTM B221). Both the M28 fin and housing components are also anodized (Finish 7.2.1 of Mil Std 171, shall withstand a 96-hour Salt Spray Test).  Six individual blades are extruded at the end of the boom. Each blade is precisely canted at 4 degrees 46 minutes.  The center of the M28 fin component is hollow and threaded at the end so that the M752A1 ignition cartridge can be inserted and secured in the fin.

<DESC>Scope of Work: <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems is conducting market research through a request for information regarding industry's interest and capability in providing an expeditionary ballistic protection system for military shelters and other critical assets.  Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business.  Responses shall consist of an unclassified white paper.  At a minimum, the white paper shall provide a description of the technical approach and a statement on the ability to meet the attached objectives and system requirements.  This is not a request for quotations; this notice is for market research only.  No solicitation document exists.  The information received under this announcement may be used by the Government for developing an acquisition strategy.   Email your questions to ryan.p.devine.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> System Requirements: <br>  	The system shall consist of armor panels and any associated hardware. <br>  	The system shall be self standing. <br>  	The system shall provide ballistic and fragment protection from firearms and fragmenting munitions. <br>  	The system shall be modular and capable of surrounding military shelters and other critical assets. <br>  	Each panel module shall be 86 quote mark H x 48 quote mark W.  A module may be comprised of a single panel or a combination of panels (stacked in tandem), whichever will best achieve the requirements.  However, no single panel shall weigh more than 147 lbs.   <br>  	The system shall withstand the blast loading associated with fragmenting munitions threats. <br>  	The system shall be man portable with a team of four soldiers, meaning no individual component shall weigh more than 147 lbs.  <br>  	The system shall deploy at a minimum rate of one linear foot per minute (four minutes per module), including any associated anchoring. <br>  	The system shall be deployed without any special tools or equipment.  <br>  	When deployed, the system shall withstand the same wind conditions as a soft wall shelter - steady winds up to 55 mph with gusts up to 65 mph. <br>  	The system shall be capable of being packaged in a TRICON shipping container. Each container has 88   quote mark H x 90   quote mark W x 76 quote mark D as useable storage space. <br>  	The packed system shall not sustain damage when transported by military vehicles or customary military transport vessels. <br>  	They system shall be capable of deployment and strike in extreme environments (+1200F to -500F) and shall be resistant to degradation in extreme environments. <br>  	The system must continue to provide ballistic protection when deployed outside in extreme environments for up to two years. <br>  	All components of the system must be fire resistant. <br>  	The system shall weigh no more than 10 pounds per square foot of protection. <br>  	The system shall not rely on soil fill to achieve protection requirements. <br>  <br> Objectives: <br>  	The vendor shall aim to reduce system cost in any way possible.  Due to the large surface areas to be protected in a base camp, keeping system cost low is very important. <br>  	The vendor shall provide data which demonstrates the ballistic and fragmentation protection capability of the proposed panel material. <br>  	The vendor shall provide data which demonstrates the blast overpressure capability of the proposed system. <br>  	The vendor shall provide means to define system design and orientation. <br>  	The vendor shall provide manufacturing capability. <br>  	The vendor shall provide manufacturing capacity. <br>  	The vendor shall provide system unit cost per linear foot. <br>  	The vendor shall describe employment of protection system. <br>  	The vendor shall describe how the system will be self standing.

<DESC>This Draft Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Information (RFI) announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy at 3.2.1.3.8. 

This is a DRAFT SIR/ RFI; this is not a FINAL Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind. The FAA will use responses to this Draft SIR/RFI for informational purposes only and will not publish any results related to this request. The FAA is not seeking, nor accepting, unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing any response to this Draft SIR/RFI.  Any costs associated with this Draft SIR/RFI submittal are solely at the interested vendors expense. 

I. PURPOSE
The purpose of publishing this draft SIR is to solicit and assess industry input and comments regarding the planned follow-on contract to the Traffic Flow Management (TFM) Modernization (TFM-M), FAA Contract Number DTFAWA-04-C-00045. This is an effort to promote open communications with vendors to improve the quality of the Final Screening Information Request/ Request for Offer (SIR/RFO). 

Based on information received in response to the Market Survey previously posted in March 2013, the FAA has made a determination to conduct this procurement under full and open negotiated competitive procedures as opposed to setting it aside for only small business participation.  The FAA intends to incorporate the agency level small business goals as a small business subcontracting requirement in the awarded contract. 

The FAA is NOT currently planning to conduct face-to-face meetings as part of this communication.   Therefore, interested parties are advised to respond to this announcement, and to respond with complete, accurate, and thorough information.  

II. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
The FAA anticipates the award of a new contract, Traffic Flow Management 2 (TFM2), in 2015 with the goal of continuing the design, development, test, implementation, and operations and maintenance of TFM technologies. These goals include future development efforts.  The contract will include provisions for program management, systems engineering, system design, system development, test, training, implementation, integrated logistics support, system upgrades, and technology refresh.  The anticipated contract will also include requirements to provide continued operations and maintenance support for the TFM System. 
The FAA envisions the anticipated contract as a hybrid type contract consisting of Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), and Time and Materials (T&M) CLINs and sub-CLINs.  The TFM Development component is expected to be Cost Plus Incentive Fee type CLIN(s) and the TFM Operations and Maintenance component is expected to be Cost Plus Fixed Fee type CLIN(s).   Additionally, The FAA envisions optional CLIN(s) that will allow the contractor to perform Engineering Services, Functional Enhancement design, development, test, and deployment on a task order basis.

The current TFM-M contract is a 12-year contract valued at approximately $593.5M.  TFM2 is expected to be a 12-year contract of a similar size, scope, and complexity.

III. DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT TRAFFIC FLOW MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROGRAM

The FAAs Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), which can be accessed at http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/, provides the vision and roadmap for modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet future air traffic demands.  The execution of this plan involves the research, development and deployment of new Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems, technologies, and decision support tools to meet these growing demands safely and efficiently.  The FAA works in cooperation with the airlines and other NAS users to implement Traffic Flow Management (TFM) programs to reduce delays to ensure smooth and efficient traffic flow through FAA-controlled airspace, thereby saving the flying public and airlines millions of dollars per year in avoided delay.  The FAAs Air Traffic Systems, Decision Support Programs Office, is responsible for developing and deploying technology to support the safe and efficient movement of aircraft through the NAS, and ensuring that new TFM systems and technologies provide NAS-Level benefits in addition to providing localized benefits within a particular volume of airspace or phase of flight.  
The current TFM System (TFMS) assists the Traffic Management Specialist (TMS) and Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) in making decisions that reduce air travel delays through information sharing and collaborative decision-making.  TMS specialists work at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) in Warrenton, VA, and provide centralized management of TFM capabilities.  Staff at other facilities who coordinate with the ATCSCC include TMCs at the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), the combined Center Radar Approach Control (CERAP) facilities, high activity Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities, and high activity Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCT).  Time-sensitive data is provided to the TMCs to strategically maximize the efficient use of available capacity across the entire NAS in response to situations such as bad weather or heavy usage.  The TFM system provides the TMCs with the automated tools that enable data sharing, arrival/departure management, congestion management, system impact assessment, and performance assessment.
The modernized TFMS enables the implementation of a centralized system for data capture, analysis, and reporting that results in the generation of a standardized set of system performance metrics.  Improvements for data sharing, arrival and departure management, and congestion management enables better recognition, prediction and response to the dynamic NAS for improved passenger throughput and more equitable allocation of resources among users.

IV. INDUSTRY OUTREACH

The FAA conducted two Industry Outreach events (April 2014, and October 2014) at which time an overview of the program and status of the TFM2 procurement was provided.  The briefings provided at these events, and questions/responses that arose as a result of the briefings, have been posted as a part of this announcement at https://faaco.faa.gov.

V.  RESPONSES TO DRAFT SIR 

Interested vendors may submit comments and/or questions on or before October 24, 2014.  All comments and questions should be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer at:  Sharonda.Holmes@faa.gov.  The FAA plans to publish the comments and questions (non-attributed) along with the FAAs response to each on the FAA Contracting Opportunities website ;  https://faaco.faa.gov.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government required the the Lifecell Strattice Tissue Implant for a ventral hernia repair at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) at Wright Patterson AFB (WPAFB). The doctor has exhausted all other options for this patient and determined that the Lifecell Strattice Tissue Implant was the only treatment that allowed contoured fit for reconstruction. Because of the contour, the Strattice implant fits into the patient's abdomen with an exact fit preventing excess tissue implants from being used. The surgeon has trained using the Lifecell Strattice Tissue Implant and if this item was not used the surgery would have needed to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2235<br />Name:		Pen, Retractable Gel, Black Ink, Fine Point<br />Description:	Retractable gel ink pen, black ink, .5mm, fine point with pocket clip. Pen is non-refillable. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2236<br />Name:		Pen, Retractable Gel, Blue Ink, Fine Point<br />Description:	Retractable gel ink pen, blue ink, .5mm, fine point with pocket clip. Pen is non-refillable. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2135<br />Name:		Pen, Retractable Gel, Black Ink, Medium Point<br />Description:	Retractable gel ink pen, black ink, .7mm, medium point with pocket clip. Pen is non-refillable. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2136<br />Name:		Pen, Retractable Gel, Blue Ink, Medium Point<br />Description:	Retractable gel ink pen, blue ink, .7mm, medium point with pocket clip. Pen is non-refillable. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2237<br />Name:		Pen, Retractable Gel, Black Ink, Bold Point<br />Description:	Retractable gel ink pen, black ink, 1.0mm, bold point with pocket clip. Pen is non-refillable. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2238<br />Name:		Pen, Retractable Gel, Blue Ink, Bold Point<br />Description:	Retractable gel ink pen, blue ink, 1.0mm, bold point with pocket clip. Pen is non-refillable. UOI is DZ.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 28, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI).

<SUBJECT>Y--PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT (PLA) SURVEY  -  large Scale Construction Projects, Kellogg, ID and  surrounding area
<SOLNBR>W912DW15R0001
<ARCHDATE>10102015
<CONTACT>BOBBIE  WEITZEL, 206-764-6692

<a href="mailto:barbara.a.weitzel@nws02.usace.army.mil">USACE District, Seattle</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT (PLA) SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. <br>  <br> This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. The Corps of Engineers Seattle District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Kellogg, ID and surrounding area. This market survey is being posted for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <br>  <br> Description of Work: Upgrade and expansion of the existing Central Treatment Plant (CTP) and the Groundwater Collection System at Bunker Hill, Kellogg, Idaho. The project consists of upgrading and expanding the CTP that will treat influent flows using a lime precipitation, high-density sludge (HDS) process with filtration supporting the HDS process. The expanded treatment system will be designed to treat peak flows from 5,000 to 8,000 gallons per minute (gpm).   <br>  <br> The GWCS is anticipated to consist of a series of groundwater extraction wells located along the northern edge of the CIA, with an estimated combined pumping rate ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 gpm, a new below-grade slurry cutoff wall located down-gradient from the extraction wells, and appurtenant components to control, maintain, and monitor the system performance.  Approximate dimensions of the below-grade cutoff wall are anticipated to be 8,000 feet in length and 20-40 feet in depth to interface with the confining layer of the aquifer.   <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are: <br>  <br> a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b. The complexity of the project. <br> c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br> f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br> g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 22.503 - Policy: <br>  <br> a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will: <br>  <br> 1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and; <br>  <br> 2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> Accordingly, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Kellogg, ID and surrounding area? <br>  <br> (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br>  <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br>  <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the Seattle District contract? <br>  <br> (8) Please provide a list of recent (2-5 years) construction projects in the local labor market of the project under consideration. Include the following items: <br>  <br> *Project Name/Location *Project Description *Initial Cost Est./Actual Final Cost *Was the project completed on time *Number of craft trades present on the project *PLA (Y/N) *Were there any challenges experienced during the project? <br>  <br> 1. <br> 2. <br>  <br> (9) Which trades are expected to be employed on a project based on the description above? Are you likely to need some union skilled trades for at least part of this project?  <br>  <br> (10) What market share does union labor have in the geographic area for this project or type of construction? <br>  <br> (11) Does the local market contain the sufficient number of available skilled workers for this project?

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation VA-263-15-Q-0090 is being issued a Request for Quotation (RFQ) as a small business set-aside and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-76. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541380 with the small business size standard of $14 million.
The Iowa City VA Health Care System in Iowa City, Iowa, has a requirement for the Annual Inspection and Certification of: Biological Safety Cabinets (52), Fume Hoods (19), Misc. HEPA (6), Laminar Flow (1) Animal Housing (11), Animal Change Station (6); and Semiannual Inspection and Certification of: Biological Safety Cabinets (2); Clean Room Testing (2); and provide a price for each re-certification trip. Quotation is to be for Base Year and four (4) Option Years. (See attached RFQ for schedule and Statement of Work).
SCOPE OF WORK - PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
Each unit listed on the contract is required to receive one inspection within the contract period of November 1, 2014, through October 31, 2015, with four one year options available.  The inspection must be done on or before the one year anniversary date of the last certification.  In addition, items marked as requiring two inspections will be inspected six months later.  All tests will conform to current ASHRAE HVAC Systems and Applications and standards listed below.
If a hood is identified by the Contractor as in need of repairs and/or filter changes that prevents the Contractor from being able to appropriately perform certification activities and/or pass certification of that hood, then the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) in the Safety Office at Building 21, Room 1B06F, at (319) 338-0581, extension 6843 immediately upon identification of the issue.  The VA will arrange for repairs to be made at no additional cost to the Contractor.  If the repairs are completed while the Contractor is still on site, the Contractor shall complete certification of the hood that needed repair.  If the repair does not get completed by the VA within the time the Contractor is on site, the VA will arrange for re-certification at no additional cost to the Contractor.
Tests of Biological Safety Cabinets will consist of, at a minimum, Primary Tests 1, 2, 3, and 4 listed in Annex F of NSF STD 49, 1992 edition.  Tests of Laminar Flow (Horizontal) Cabinets will conform to IES RP-CC-002, parts 4, 5, and 6.

The height for 100 fpm will be written on the side of the hood on a sticker designed for this purpose and supplied by the vendor.  A test report will be generated for each fume hood and any comments or problems noted.  For fume hoods that have the motor in the room, the ductwork will be tested for leaks and sealed if any leaks are found.
All hoods with Ultraviolet lamps will be tested with a UV meter.  The contractor will report on the inspection from the output of the lamp as a percent of rated intensity (e.g. 80% of rated intensity).
All test equipment must be calibrated within the last 12 months to an NBS traceable standard.  Calibration certification letters for equipment must be kept with the contractor technician for review by the VA at the time of inspection.

<p>&nbsp;<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's</p>
<p>(c) accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(d) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised</p>

<p>(CLIN 0001) Laser Diode System <br />Quantity : 2 each<br />Specifications:<br />Laser diode system output power needs to be greater than or equal to 2 Watts. <br />Laser output needs to be 795nm. <br />&bull; Frequency needs to be tunable from 785nm to 805nm with mode free hopping range greater than 10GHz.<br />&bull; Vertical to horizontal polarization ratio out of the final laser needs to be 100:1.<br />Current noise in the electrical supply for the master laser needs to be in the range of 300picoamps per square root of Hertz and 0.3microamps in 1 Megahertz of bandwidth and -145dBm into 50 ohms.<br />Please include graph of current noise level from DC to 1 MHz.</p>
<p>Laser absolute linewidth needs to be less than 200kHz full width at half maximum at 75% of maximum output power when integrated over 1 second when locked to an atomic resonance.</p>
<p>Laser mount must be solid and should be free of acoustic resonances. To verify, please include graph of frequency noise from 30 Hz to 90KHz for the unlocked laser.<br />Vendor shall provide documentation that laser has and can be used for locking to atomic resonance. Electronic power supply needs to be single unit rack mount, 3U or less, box for everything.<br />Electronic power supply needs to have a minimum of two high voltage piezo drivers. Power supply needs to have a minimum of three channel feedback for both cavity piezo control and current feedback with greater than 80dB noise suppression.<br />&bull; Power supply needs to contain temperature controller, differential high-bandwidth, low-noise photo-detector with power to photo-detector supplied by the power supply, and sweep generator, and the low noise current supply.<br />&bull; Power supply needs to have front panel display and output for external oscilloscope.<br />&bull; Power supply needs to contain modulator and demodulator for AC modulation without broadening the laser line-width. Modulator output maximum should be at least +/-8 Volts amplitude, can be adjusted, and can supply up to +/-500milliamps<br />Laser diodes needs to be user replaceable without having to replace entire module. <br />High (&gt;2Watts) and low power (&gt;100milliwatts) optical isolators with &gt;35dB isolation are required.<br />Optical noise for the diode laser (technical documentation - graph) needs to be provided as well. <br />Single mode fiber coupling efficiency needs to be &gt;70%.<br />If the system consists of an amplifier, then noise data (technical documentation - graph) for the amplifier needs to be provided. <br />The optical noise measurement will be done as follows:<br />First, split the beam 50/50 and send each beam into a photodiode and measure the difference signal on an RF <br />spectrum analyzer. This difference measurement will cancel the classical noise and will determine the shot noise level.<br />Now that you know the shot noise level for this power level, send the beam with the same total power into a photodiode with at least 10 MHz bandwidth. The signal from this photodiode needs to then be sent into an RF spectrum analyzer.<br />How far the 2nd measurement is above the 1st measurement determines the excess noise above shot noise. Please provide graphs of this difference vs frequency from 10kHz to 10MHz, including graphs of each measurement and electronic noise floor for reference.</p>
<p>Caution: Make sure that the sum of the power from the two beams in the first measurement equals the power of the beam in the second measurement.<br />Please do these measurements for the beam from the seed laser and from the amplifier. We will accept data at 780nm if the vendor warrants the noise spectra at 795nm.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS<br />1. Breakout Pricing for each component of the Laser Diode System<br />2. Laser Use Documentation identified in <br />3. Technical documentation - graphs<br />a.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The closing date has been extended until 17 November 2014.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Stryker Neuro System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard is for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Buffalo Supply Inc., 1650 Coal Creek Drive, Suite A, Lafayette, CO, 80026-8867. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 10 Oct 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Stryker Neuro System is the only known system that the Ortho-Spine Surgeon is trained on for this type of spinal procedure. The system also allows optimal screw pitch that is suited for the osteoporotic patient requiring surgery. The Ortho-Spine surgeon has trained using these Stryker implants and plating systems and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost of approximately $20,000.00.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Laura.Caravantes@us.af.mil no later than1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 10 Oct 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-T-0012, Stryker Neuro System." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia 22448-5110 intends to procure (quantity of five) AN/USQ-T48(V) Trainer Simulator/Stimulator Systems (TSSS) units used in the Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system on a sole source basis to AAI Corporation (AAI).
This is a noncommercial procurement.
 AAI is the only qualified source to provide the TSSS hardware. The AAI Corporation AN/USQ-T48(V) Trainer Simulator/Stimulator Systems (TSSS) units used in the Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) system were tested extensively and qualified as part of the approved BFTT Navy ships configuration by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, IN, and CDSA Dam Neck, as the BFTT Acquisition Engineering Agent (AEA). The AAI Corporation TSSS are uniquely military items that fill critical support functions in shipboard integrated combat systems training. AAI Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the TSSS units in the approved configuration. There are no known resellers of this OEM product.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval For
Other Than Full and Open Competition Project Minneapolis Building 217 Roof Replacement


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 23, Minneapolis VA Health Care System , 2237 number: 618-14-3-6023-2531

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: Sole source award of a firm fixed price NRM construction contract to a Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, for the purpose of replacing the roof on Building 217, Minneapolis VA Health Care System.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: Construction services to replace roofing on a Government-owned building. The Independent Government Estimate for Construction is less than $25,000. The planned delivery is sixty days, beginning in September 2014.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: Authorized by Statute, FAR 6.302-5, Public Law 109-461, Veterans First Contracting.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Public Law 109-461 authorizes Contracting Officers to sole source awards to Veteran Owned Small Businesses. In this specific situation, the contractor is a newly organized, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned small business. Supporting this new business using the authority of PL 109-461 is in the best interest of  the Government and serves the public trust by helping to develop a capable veteran-owned construction resource.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: None. This action is planned and executed specifically as a sole source acquisition of construction services.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The IGCE has been thoroughly reviewed and is believed to be accurate.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: A search of the Dynamic Small Business Search system was conducted. Search terms were: "women-owned," "Minnesota," and "NAICS 236220." The search produced a list of 11 potential firms. A second search of the Vet Biz database showed that two of  the firms were verified as SDVOSBs: Allarea Contractors and Midwest Select Contracting. Allarea is a known, established firm, one of the current VISN 23 MATOC contract holders. The only other firm, Midwest Select Contracting, LLC, is a start-up.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: The Department of Veterans Affairs socio-economic goals include women-owned small business.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None.
 
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Regarding women-owned small business, as Midwest Select Contracting develops, the long-term intention is to reduce sole source awards and compete appropriate contracts as woman-owned SDVOSB set-asides.

12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona   Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and
 
belief.

<DESC>The J&A provides for an ordering period extension of nine (9) months to allow for the procurement of approximately 3,140 Installation Kits (I-Kits) with an estimated value of $12.41M.  The ordering period extension of nine (9) months on the W15P7T-11-D-C601 contract will start 28 September 2014 and end 27 June 2015.  The procurement of these additional 3,140 I-Kits will occur via subsequent, separately funded Delivery Orders (DOs) that will ensure a gap in services is not sustained and is essential to ensure a successful transition to a competitive supply contract.

<DESC>Passage of the Emerald Shiner in the Niagara River and tributaries is obstructed due to impassable water velocities, hastened by<br />hardened shorelines. The Emerald Shiner is a prey fish and a critical component of the Niagara River and Lake Erie food web, as<br />codified in the Fish Community Objectives developed by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Fish Community Objectives define delisting targets for the Degradation of Fish Populations Beneficial Use Impairment for the Niagara River Remedial Action Plan. Small fish passage is an emerging area of study and requires thorough research and investigation<br />prior to project implementation.
<p>This project requires highly specialized equipment and advanced experience involving fine scale hydraulic engineering research. The use of a hydraulic flume is a critical requirement for accomplishment of the scope of work. The Wilkeson Hydraulic (Flume) Laboratory at the University at Buffalo occupies approximately 1200 sq ft, and has the following major equipment and<br />instrumentation: 10-m long, 0.5-m wide, and 0.5-m deep tilting re-circulating flume; mixing box; particle image Velocimetry system; acoustic Doppler and electromagnetic current meters and bucket-wheel current meters; and acoustic bed profilers, stage recorders, bed load and suspended sediment samplers, turbidity meters, and surveying instrumentation.</p>

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  $120,000. Yogamedics, LLC, 5640 W. Maple Rd, West Bloomfield, MI 48322.  Period of Performance 10/1/2014 to 9/30/2015.  The contractor shall provide a customized evidence-based interactive yoga program to treat chronic pain conducted by a certified Yoga Therapist.  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;

	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  

Yogamedics LLC provides a unique customized evidence-based interactive yoga program to treat chronic pain instead of yoga program provided by a Certified Yoga Therapist that has some pain management aspects.

The software package offered by Yogamedics shows specific measurable progress in terms of evidence based measurements for yoga therapy as well as progress reports for each patient.  Session summaries are completed after each client is seen, and incorporated into each client's treatment plan.

Yogamedics LLC developed a patented protocol of poses and messaging that reduces or eliminates pain and is safe for all injuries to the back, neck, shoulders, and hips.  In addition to physical postures they teach specific pain management techniques that patients will use in the long term.  While most Yoga offers some relief for pain, Yogamedics offers a program specifically designed for pain relief.
Yogamedics LLC has a medical advisory board including doctors with different areas of expertise, physical therapists, yoga therapists, and psychologists. This Board develops and oversees therapy, and meets regularly to discuss new developments in the area of pain management and yoga therapy and how to integrate these into YogaMedics.

All Yogamedics therapists are CYT's who have an a additional 100 hours of yoga training from Yogamedics and 30 hours of continuing education per year.



6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A sources sought notice was published on 7/17/2014, VA251-14-R-0485, to identify other sources that are capable of providing a customized evidence-based interactive yoga program to treat chronic pain conducted by a certified Yoga Therapist.  There were four (4) responses, Yogamedics, ADDON Services,, Strive Recreational Servces and Centering Yoga.  Addon Services, Strive Recreational Services offered the services of a CYT only.  Centering Yoga is not registered in SAM and may be interested in future contracts at the John  D. Dingell VAMC.  Only Yogamedics provided details of an evidence based yoga program to treat chronic pain utilizing a certified yoga instructor and customized software program.


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The cost, $120,000.00/yr  or  $10,000.00 per month is the same price as the last contract, VA251-12-C-0133. A survey of market prices for  Individual Yoga Sessions show the same price$120.00 per hour for individual sessions.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  A market study was conducted, this service is only available through the open market and small businesses dominate this market.  Yogamedics, LLC is the only therapeutic yoga vendor is the Detroit Metropolitan Area.  There are, however, several yoga studios that offer recreational Yoga, which has some pain management aspects.

<DESC>This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501 in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limited-Sources Justification." The circumstances justifying limiting sources is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Only one source, Compusearch is capable of performing the services required at the level of quality required due to its status as the incumbent contractor. PRISM is the only system of procurement for OPO. The operational impacts of not awarding a task order will compromise OPO's ability to meet end of fiscal year procurement obligations and subsequently forfeit a wide range of DHS requirements. Compusearch is uniquely capable of ensuring uninterrupted services for DHS. As the current provider of PRISM Support Services, Compusearch can effectively provide continuous support services, on an interim basis.

<DESC>The National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Contracting Office, IANG-PEO-KO, Charlottesville, VA, awarded a sole source firm-fixed-price task order on 27 September 2014 to Data Solutions & Technology (DST), Inc. under General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule GS-35F-0587S for CJDB Support Services  [Combat Incident Database (CIDB) and Joint Trauma Analysis for the Prevention of Injury in Combat Database (JTAPICDB)].  Specific tasks for the CJDB Support Services include Technical Project Management, Applications Operations and Maintenance, Application Enhancements, Requirements Management, and Information Assurance. <br>  <br> Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), the agency's compelling need for CJDB Support Services was so urgent that following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays.  The task order provided support to the CJDB applications without further distraction/disruption, additional and unnecessary costs, and the risks associated with competing a bridge contract.  CJDB Support Services are specialized, complex, and extremely critical to the NGIC mission.  DST, Inc. was the only source with the knowledge and expertise to quickly meet the unique requirements on a time sensitive basis.  DST, Inc. already had the proper training, level of expertise, required clearances, and available personnel.  Also, the award to DST Inc. will provide CJDB Support Services until current NGIC Production and S&TI Software Programs (NPSP) protests are resolved. <br>  <br> See attached Limited Sources Justification.
