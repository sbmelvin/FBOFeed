<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) intends to issue a sole source purchase order under Commercial Items, FAR Part 12 to SP Plus Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The acquisition will consist of 70 parking spaces located at the 1201 Sys Street NW, Washington DC 20005-5905 location. 

The garage located at 1201 Eye Street, NW, Washington DC 20005-5905 is managed by SP Plus Corporation is in a unique positions to meet the needs of the NPS. The NPS leases several floors of the building at 1201 Eye Street, NW.  This requirement would provide 70 paid spaces as well as 5 spaces included in the original lease agreement for a total of 75 parking spaces. In accordance with the NPS collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the NTEU, NPS is required to provide available parking. Although the CBA does not identify the specific location of the available parking, the employees assigned parking permits and working at 1201 Eye Street, NW, currently park at 1201 Eye Street. Any change in location would constitute a change in workplace conditions and subject to formal bargaining with NTEU in accordance with Article 52 of the CBA which would require significant commitment of time and resources. Also with the 5 spaces that are included in the lease, this saves the Government approximately $14,040.00 per year in parking fees.

Use of the garage at 1201 Eye Street, NW would not be subject to bargaining as the NPS and NTEU agree  to use of that facility.

The NPS also uses a portion of the parking permits for NPS-owned law enforcement vehicles and having them parked at a different facility may negatively impact the ability of the NPS law enforcement staff to fulfill their responsibilities.

Additionally, employees with disabilities may find it extremely difficult to walk to 1201 Eye Street, NW from other facilities. Since NPS would still have to provide reasonable accommodations for these individuals at 1201 Eye Street, NW we may end up with two parking contracts if another vendor is selected to fulfill this requirement.  

Further, parking in the building provides an additional level of security for those individuals who work unusual hours.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, interested firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  The Government will consider all responses received by 10:00am MST, June 20, 2016.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Responses should be forwarded to Heather Madsen via email at heather_madsen@nps.gov. NPS will not provide a reply until after the closing date of Thursday, June 20, 2016 when all parties have had an opportunity to respond.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<p>Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC), Energy Conservation Services<br />Solicitation Number: W912DY16RUES9<br />Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE HNC, Huntsville</p>
<p>Classification Code:<br />S -- Utilities</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />221210 Natural Gas Distribution<br />221122 Electric Power Distribution<br />221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. Executive Order 13693 of March 19, 2015, requires a reduction in agency building energy intensity measured in British thermal units per gross square foot by 2.5% annually through the end of fiscal year 2025, relative to the baseline of the agency's building energy use in fiscal year 2015, and a reduction in agency potable water consumption intensity by 36% by fiscal year 2025, through reductions of 2% annually through fiscal year 2025, relative to a baseline of the agency's water consumption in fiscal year 2007. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) project for US Army Garrison (USAG) Fort Greely, Alaska.</p>
<p>2. Background: 10 U.S.C. 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, established the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities. 42 U.S.C. &sect; 8256(c)(3) encourages agencies to enter into contracts with electric, water and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.<br />- Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.</p>
<p>- Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.</p>
<p>- Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.</p>
<p>- If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Requirement: The requirement at USAG Fort Greely AK, is for comprehensive UESC services not limited to these Energy Conservation Measures:<br /><br />Decentralize the heating distribution system and configure system for natural gas usage.</p>
<p>3. Project Information:</p>
<p>A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 25 year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.</p>
<p>4. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a Request For Quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Request for Quotation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
