<DESC>DESC: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Space Vehicles Directorate, Integrated Experiments and Evaluation Division, Kirtland AFB, NM, intends to award a sole source contract to MicroSat Systems, Inc. (MSI) for the following described effort based on technology developed and demonstrated by MSI under previously awarded open competition.


BACKGROUND: 

The history of RSP is embedded in the TechSat 21 effort.  TechSat 21 is an Other Transaction for Prototype (OTA) issued under VS-00-01 BAA, Technical Area Number 10, Microsatellite Formation Flying, synopsized on 17 Dec 1999.   Due to funding issues and change in program direction, the OT is being converted to a FAR Cost Plus Fixed Fee, completeion type contract.

The objective of Techsat 21 was to show demonstration of formations of microsatellites flying in close proximity to perform missions otherwise performed by larger, monolithic satellites.

The objective of RSP is to rapidly design, build, test, and field an operationally relevant microsatellite system; reduce timelines for development, test, launch, and checkout; and provide a responsive capability to the user.

 
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposed contract is to: 

Build, and deliver a microsatellite bus, using available excess hardware, within nine months; and, leverage previous government investment on the development of small, low cost satellite components and systems.  There will be options for two additional microsatellite buses.  This contract is meant to build upon the effort developed under the VS-00-01 BAA, Technical Area Number 10, Microsatellite Formation Flying, for Other Transaction for Prototype, awarded Jul 00 to MSI.     

The period of performance for the above effort is 20 months, to also include integration, testing, launch and six months of on-orbit operations, with an anticipated start date of Nov 2003. The option periods will not be more than 18 months each.  A contract will be awarded to MSI, provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms. Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A cost and technical proposal is required, to include a draft program plan, list of government furnished information or property required, statement of work including work breakdown structure (WBS), program schedule, management plan, risk and technology management, as well as resumes of key personnel.  The technical proposal is limited to a total of 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. The cost proposal should include an estimate to include hours and rates, and summary by WBS for a cost plus fixed fee type contract.  Submit responses of intent to Shari Barnett, Det 8 PKVI, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: SIC 541710, size standard 1,000 employees. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for further information on certification and the approval process.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

There will be no formal request for proposals or other solicitations regarding this announcement. Proposals shall be submitted with an original, not exceeding 40 double-spaced pages plus three (3) copies. Proposals shall be mailed to 325 CONS/LGCBA, ATTN: Dale Peaden, Contracting Officer, 501 Illinois Avenue Suite 5, Tyndall AFB FL 32403-5526, marked for BAA TYN 04-002 or e-mailed to dale.peaden@tyndall.af.mil.

Requirements: The Air Force requires advanced technologies that facilitate the conduct of contingency base operations, combat support functions, and force protection in both homeland security and Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) operations.  In addition, provide opportunities for reduction of weight, volume, and costs of base emergency response, infrastructure support, and combat support systems.  

AFRL/MLQ solicits cutting edge proposals in the following general technology areas:  

Atmospheric Threat Protection - Identify characteristic emissions or patterns that enable detection, identification, and/or modeling of anthropogenic chemicals in or transported through the atmosphere.  Develop and/or evaluate methods or technologies enabling localization and/or identification of these emission sources, for example storage, use, or accidental/deliberate release of toxic chemicals.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from atmospheric threats, either inside or adjacent to forward operating bases, and that may contribute to reducing or eliminating threats to personnel and equipment.  

Protective Technologies - Develop chemical processes and passive or self-decontaminating materials that will reduce recovery time and provide a significant improvement in decontamination capabilities.  Develop sensing, active and passive protection, and decontamination technologies for improved force protection at fixed and forward bare airbases.  Develop systems for detecting and quantifying toxic materials or hazards (chemical, biological, radiological, and energetic).  Provide technology for automated hazard warning/avoidance, neutralization or decontamination, and decontamination validation in operational areas and industrial sites.  Develop technologies to technician operable/maintainable, affordable, deployable and modular, allowing rapid mobilization and demobilization.  Hazard avoidance during operations will allow sustained operations tempo; assurance of effective decontamination of equipment and operational areas; and ability to continue operations in “shirtsleeve” environment.  

Explosive Effects Mitigation – Identify explosive characteristic effects or patterns that enable detection, evaluation, and/or modeling of the explosive and resulting effects.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate protective technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from blast, ballistic, and fragmentation effects.  Develop new materials, technologies, and/or methodologies to mitigate blast effects resulting in reduced injuries and deaths to building/shelter occupants.  

Shelters – Develop new and advanced shelters that are lightweight and low volume, easy to erect, and requires low maintenance.  The new shelter will be used for housing personnel and aircraft maintenance and storage for long term and under harsh environments.  Specific areas of interest include: airbeam technology based on lightweight and high strength fibers integrated solar power and corporation of chem/bio and directed energy protection into shelter.  

Air Base Operating Surfaces  - Develop lightweight portable airfield evaluation technologies for surface and subsurface material characterization, expedient repair materials and techniques, lightweight high-strength materials, and measurement and prediction in response to traffic and environmental loads.  

Protection of Deployed Forces and Assets  - Develop lightweight rapidly deployable personnel and aircraft shelters, and protection systems for facilities and aircraft parking areas.  Specific areas of interest include ultra-lightweight, high-strength materials, exploitation of in situ materials, and post-construction reinforcement of facilities, simulation and modeling of effects of air-blast and fragmentation, and chemical/biological protection systems.  

Combat Utility Systems – Develop new energy and utility systems technologies that increase mobility, reliability, and efficiency on all deployable utilities required for AEF operations.  Specific areas of interest include: fuel reforming to produce hydrogen, fermentative and photosynthetic production of hydrogen from deployed base waste streams, active and passive power generation, power conditioning and distribution systems, environmental control units, and solid/liquid deployable waste management systems.  

Robotics/Explosive Ordnance Disposal – Develop automation technologies for use in high threat areas for AEF and related uses. The specific areas of interest include new technology for: explosive ordnance and mine detection, characterization, and disposal, including buried, surface and underwater ordnance; ground vehicle navigation and guidance; sensing systems; robotic vehicle systems, including teleoperation and automation technology; site survey vehicles; and related automated construction technologies.  

Fire Fighting - Develop agents, systems, equipment and hardware for use in aircraft firefighting and rescue operations, airbase structural firefighting, weapons systems firefighting, hazardous materials incidents, and improved firefighter training.  Develop DoD firefighting systems such as munitions protection and explosion mitigation.  Specific areas of interest include the development of environmentally compatible, operationally and cost effective fire extinguishing agents, aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles/systems, fire detection/suppression systems, specialized rescue and personnel protective equipment, and training technologies.  The objective is to enhance airbase and other DoD firefighting safety programs and training capabilities that significantly reduce the amount of time to extinguish fires, extract victims, and minimize damage/casualties.  

Biocatalytic Materials Synthesis – High-performance space and aerospace materials are often produced by complex sequences of reactions involving toxic solvents and expensive catalysts.  Some materials are derived from structures that are difficult to make via traditional synthetic chemical techniques.  Successful development of green chemistry approaches to materials synthesis would not only reduce the cost of the material, but also eliminate negative environmental impacts.  One successful approach for synthesis of industrial, pharmaceutical, and agricultural chemicals involves biocatalysis – the use of living cells or enzymes as catalysts for chemical reactions.  Biocatalysis may yield novel materials or better synthetic pathways to known materials by allowing targeted production of specific structures under mild conditions required to support biological processes.

Proposal Preparation: Responses submitted shall include a proposal for technical and cost/price as follows: 

   (a) The technical proposal must include an outline and full discussion of the nature and scope of the research, the method or technical approach, and the expected results of each proposal. This proposal should offer scientific advancement in the state of the art. The technical proposal must identify privately developed items, components, processes or computer software entailed in their proposed approach, if any. Information must be included on prior work/experience in the indicated field of research and the available facilities. Management resources shall include resumes of people who will be participating in the proposed design effort, and identify the principal investigator. 

   (b) The cost/price proposal requires submission of cost or pricing data IAW FAR 15.403-5 with a supporting detailed cost schedule and shall contain a per person/hour breakdown per task. FAR 15.403-5 may be located at http//www.arnet.gov.far/ The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. 

Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will compete for contract award based upon their potential value to the government in fulfilling the requirements set forth above. That value will be determined using a complex combination of criteria including the technical promise (originality, feasibility, desirability, etc.), affordability (of development, considering technical alternatives and funding available, and of implementation if otherwise successful), and the government's confidence in the effective pursuit of the effort considering the scope of the effort, the offeror's understanding of it, the competence and availability of experienced engineering, scientific, managerial, or other technical personnel, offeror's overall corporate experience (including past performance), and the availability of, or ability to obtain, necessary facilities to perform this effort. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, a part thereof or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Technical consideration will be given greater weight than cost in the selection decision. No further evaluation criteria will be used in source selection. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Deliverable Items: (a) Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), DI-MISC-81183A, (b) Contractors Progress Status and Management Report, DI-MGMT-80227, (c) Still Photographic Records, DI-MISC-81206, (d) Presentation Material, DI-ADMN-81373, (e) Scientific and Technical Reports, DI-MISC-80711 (Draft and reproducible final, AFRL/MLQ format).

======================STATEMENT OF WORK===================
STATEMENT OF WORK
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS              

1. BACKGROUND
 
 The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center (DFAS/CA) performs financial and accounting functions for several governmental agencies conducting various operations throughout the world.  The Center currently has a one-year contract, which expires on September 30, 2003.  The purpose of this solicitation is to open the bidding to interested parties in establishing a long-term contract for a process that allows the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center to continue paying foreign vendors/contractors in a variety of foreign currencies.
 
2. SCOPE

A. Concept of Operations:

1.  Disbursements -

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center will establish an account(s) with the contract bank.  When processing foreign currency payment(s) to foreign vendors/contractors, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center shall notify the contract bank of the impending payment(s).  Upon notification, the contract bank shall purchase the amount of foreign currency required for the payment(s) and provide the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center the exchange rate and U.S. Dollar equivalent.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center will process the payment(s) in U.S. Dollars for deposit into an established account for subsequent transfer by the contract bank to the payee in the specified foreign currency.  The contract bank should have the capability of transferring foreign currency via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Check/Draft.  The proposed system should eliminate the need for Limited Depository Accounts (LDA¡¦s), as outlined in the DoDFMR, Volume 5, Chapter 14.

2.  Erroneous Payments -

In the event an erroneous payment is made, it may be necessary for the contract bank to research the payment and provide copies of documents related to that payment.  If the payment must be voided and collected back into the account, the contract bank must refund the exact U.S. Dollar amount at the exchange rate quoted for the original disbursement resulting in no gain or loss due to exchange fluctuation.   

3.  Collections -

The contract bank should also have the capability of receiving and forwarding collections from debtors.  These would be payments made payable to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center in a foreign currency.  The contract bank would receive the foreign currency payments and convert such payments to a U.S. Dollar equivalent for deposit into an account.  The contract bank would then forward the U.S. Dollar amount to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center.  The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Collection transactions being processed by the Contract Bank and forwarded to the Columbus Center.  

4.  Payment Date -

The payment date shall be defined as the date on which foreign currency draft or electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments are dated.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center shall establish the payment date in which the foreign currency payment must be made.  The contract bank shall be responsible to ensure the payment is made on the established payment date.  Coordination will be made between the Defense Finance and Accounting Service ¡V Columbus Center and contract bank to ensure funds are on deposit in the account on the payment date.

The Contractor shall be able to lock in a rate for a minimum of ¡§current plus five business days¡¨ for all supported currencies to allow time for transactions to be entered in DoD systems (i.e., entitlement, disbursing, and accounting systems).  

B. Disbursing Transactions:
 
The average number of foreign currency transactions for the current Fiscal Year has been 135 transactions per month.  The dollar amount of each transaction may range between $50 to $3,000,000 per transaction.  The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Disbursement transactions being processed by the Columbus Center.  

C. Fiduciary Relationship:
 
 By definition and according to the terms of the contract, the contract bank shall act as an instrument for the Defense Finance and Accounting ¡V Columbus Center in processing foreign currency transactions.  
 
D. Records Retention:              
 
All records and data turned over to the Contractor as well as any new records and data created by the Contractor remain the property of the Government.  The Contractor shall only use information obtained from direct input by DFAS staff or other data requesters into the Contractor¡¦s stand alone system for the purpose for which the data was provided.  The Contractor shall be responsible for retaining the data, as a backup, for a minimum of 6 years and 3 month, as outlined in the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives, and Records Administration.
   
 This period will require the contract bank to continue the retention and availability of records beyond the expiration/termination of the contract. The contract bank shall retain transaction records that are consistent with the requirements of the Disbursing Office. 
 
E. System Architecture:  

Any foreign currency related software should be able to accommodate the following computer system architecture:

Pentium 3 (900 Megahertz) IBM Compatible Personal Computers
128 Megabyte of RAM  
20 Gigabyte Hard Drive.
3.5 Floppy and 32X CD ROM Drive.  
US Robotics 56K Modems.  (Note: Phone line is not dedicated to Modem use only).
Windows 2000  (Note: Future plans will change to Windows XP).
Office 97
Netscape version 4.75 for web version

The Personal Computers are not connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) for the stand-alone versions

F. Support/Maintenance:                
 
It shall be incumbent upon the contract bank to support the process both administratively and technically.  Such support should include material and training to explain the process with direct access to support personnel should questions or situations arise which require an immediate response. The Contractor¡¦s primary representative or alternate(s) shall be available during normal duty hours within 60 minutes, and within 2 hours after normal duty hours to discuss problem areas.

A. The primary evaluation factors are listed below in ascending order of importance, unless otherwise indicated.

1. Operational Approach

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to Paragraphs 2.A-D  as outlined in this Statement of Work.  The offeror shall also address his/her capability of meeting the transitional requirements specified under Paragraph 2.I.  This section is limited to eight (8) pages and should address any planned future enhancement to the proposed process. 

	2.  Technical Approach  

The offeror shall provide a list of all support and maintenance functions related to their proposed process as outlined under Paragraphs 2.E-F.  This section is limited to four (4) pages.  

	3.  Cost 

The offeror shall provide a detailed list of all costs associated with the implementation, maintenance and support of the process.  This section should clearly address costs related to items listed under Paragraph 2.G and is limited to three (3) pages.

4.  System Requirements 

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to items listed under Paragraph 2.J and is limited to three (3) pages.

	B.	Scoring Method.  The following method will be used in assessing each operational, technical and cost proposal as outlined in this Statement of Work:  

	Outstanding-4	Very significantly exceeds most or all of the requirements.  Response exceeds a "Better" rating.  The Offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.

	Better-3	Fully meets all of the requirements and significantly exceeds many of the requirements.  Response exceeds an "Acceptable" rating.  The areas in which the Offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.

	Acceptable-2	Meets all of the requirements.  Complete, comprehensive, and exemplifies an understanding of the scope and depth of the task requirements as well as the Offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements.

	Marginal-1	Less than "Acceptable."  There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal.  However, given the opportunity for discussions, the technical proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least "Acceptable."  (Areas of a technical proposal which remain to be "Marginal" after "Final Revisions" offers shall not be subject to further discussion or revision.)  If award is made on initial offers, there will not be an opportunity for discussions, nor a chance to become at least "Acceptable."

	Unacceptable-0	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions: Failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet many of the requirements.  (When applying this adjective to the technical proposal as a whole, the technical proposal must be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)

5.  AWARD - BEST VALUE

	A.	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from an operational, technical and cost standpoint.  

	B.	Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Department of Defense Supplement (DFARS).  One contractor will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government.    

	C.	All evaluation factors are significantly important; however, the Government may elect to pay a price premium to select an Offeror whose operational and/or technical evaluation factors are superior.
