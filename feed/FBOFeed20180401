<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The 411th CSB, RCO Osan, Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea, is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources having an interest and industry technologies available to support/provide a Night Vision System (NVIS) compatible light that will install on all versions of the MBU-20/P mask assembly with no modifications to the mask.

<p>The Government is interested in hearing from all vendors that have a capable solution.</p>

Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be procured through full and open competition. Multiple awards may be made.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">SLAC National Lab is seeking sources for&nbsp;a contractor to replace and upgrade Cooling Towers lateral piping. Cooling Towers 1201 and 1202 cooling systems are located on the south side of the Klystron gallery. They provide cooling tower water to gallery sectors 1 through 30 via underground piping distribution network. All distribution piping is routed within 100 ft of the gallery, and piping headers are all transite pipe. Due to age of the system, the 8&rdquo; CTW and 1-1/2&rdquo; VVS lateral piping has deteriorated on some areas and require replacement. This project will be a design-build to replace and upgrade the CTW lateral piping with C900 PVC pressure pipe and VVS lateral pipes with Type K Copper.</p>
