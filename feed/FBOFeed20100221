<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an automated photoresist processing system in support of an i-line stepper photolithography tool to be located in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NanoFab Laboratory. This system will be sited and used in a multi-user clean room facility.  

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an automated photoresist processing system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small business manufacturers are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

All new, remanufactured, and/or refurbished systems shall be considered.  Re-manufactured and/or refurbished systems must meet all specifications below in addition to all manufacturers specifications. 

The system would need to meet the following requirements:
1. MODULES: The system should be capable of integrating at a minimum a vapor prime, resist coat, resist bake, resist cool, and resist develop series of processing modules into a relatively compact footprint; 
2. SUBSTRATE CAPABILITY: System should be capable of handling substrates from 75 mm wafer rounds up to and including 200 mm wafer rounds with minimal retooling necessary;
3. OPERATING SOFTWARE: System operating software shall facilitate ease of instrument use since it will be installed in a multi-user facility;
4. DELIVERY and INSTALLATION: System shall be delivered and installed no later than 10 months ARO;
5.  Any systems proposed shall have a documented history of at least three prior systems installed and operating in multi-user type facilities.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice. 

Companies that manufacture these types of systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to carol.wood@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. 

The report should include achievable specifications; demonstrate prior systems that are currently installed and operating in multi-user type facilities, and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 

1. Name and business size of the company that manufactures the system for which specifications are provided; 
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the systems, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address); 
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems; 
4. Indication of whether each system (including installation) for which specifications are sent to carol.wood@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);
 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.

All documentation must be sent to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.  E-mail address:  CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>This award was for qty 4 Dell PowerEdge R610 and Qty 6 Dell PowerEdge R710.  Firm fixed price.  

Rationale for limiting competition to the Dell brand - The acquisition was for Dell server hardware and opearting system for the support of VPN remote access to the Indian Health Service network as well as to secure Citrix applications.  This saves on IT support costs for Indian Health Service information systems infrastructure.  Morever, centrally deployed applications are easier to maintain (for example, patching and upgrading) and simpler to troubleshoot when things go wrong.  As a result, downtime is reduced, users are more productive, and security is properly maintained.  The Dell network server hardware meets the Indian Health Service configuration and equipemnt standards.  These servers are mission critical servers to provide consistent agency operation, mission, and patient care for the Indian Health Service.  It is imperative that all domain controllers be standardized in order to maintain adequate technical support, maintenance, and staffing.  The Dell equipement and technical support ensures compatibility of hardware and minimal downtime for agency critical servers.  The Dell hardware and warranty are available from multiple Dell partners.  Other manufacturers do not meet the needs of the Indian Health Service in areas of standard support, configuration and managment.

Offers proposing facilities that are not listed will be rejected as non-responsive.  In addition, the offerors facility must be compliant with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336) (42 U.S.C. 12101 et. seq.).
