<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contract Specialist 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR).  The MMS web site has descriptions of OSRR activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.  The web site address is www.mms.gov/tarphome.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.  BACKGROUND: Oil Spill Response Research sponsored by the Minerals Management Service through the Technology Research and Assessment Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements.  MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  As oil and gas industry activities increase in the deep water of Gulf of Mexico and the and ice-infested Beaufort Sea of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability as well as alternative countermeasures, including chemical dispersants, in situ burning and viscous oil pumping.  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among several general topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2004 funds. THE MMS ANTICIPATES A TOTAL OF $300,000 TO $500,000 MAY BE AVAILABLE for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSRR topics in FY 2005 with projects being identified through this announcement and additional avenues. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require one quarter to one man-year effort, and prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  THE MMS ANTICIPATES AWARDS RESULTANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS.  OBJECTIVES: The proposed objectives for the FY 2005 OSRR activities include, but are not limited to, research related to the following: 1) Innovative Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for the Open Ocean - new or innovative technologies that will facilitate the cleanup of spilled oil (both light and high density) in the open ocean.  A subject of particular interest is response techniques and equipment for removing heavy oils (crude oil as well as fuel oil) and emulsions from the sea surface.  MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate full-scale prototypes and non-commercially available technologies at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  2) Innovative Mechanical Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for Cold Water-Broken Ice Conditions - new or innovative mechanical technologies that will facilitate the containment and recovery of spilled oil in cold water-broken ice conditions.  MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain and recover oil in a range of broken ice conditions.  Focus should be on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  3) Alternative Technologies for Oil Spill Recovery in Cold Water-Broken Ice  Conditions - new or innovative technologies/methods that will facilitate oil spill response in cold water-broken ice conditions.  MMS seeks proposals to test and evaluate alternative technologies and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain and recover oil in cold water and in a range of broken ice conditions.  Focus should be on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  4) Technology for Separation of Oil, Ice and Water - new or innovative mechanical technologies that will facilitate the separation of oil, ice and water when responding to oil spills in cold water-broken ice conditions.  MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate new or innovative technologies for the separation of oil, ice and water related to oil spill response in ice-infested waters.  Focus should be on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned. Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  5)  Airborne Thickness Measurement of Oil Slicks on the Open Ocean - MMS is seeking a reliable airborne oil slick thickness sensor.  This sensor/equipment shall be able to locate and accurately map the actual thickness of the oil slick on the water and be able to send/fax a geo-referenced map of the oil slicks to responders, while airborne.  MMS seeks proposals to test and evaluate these technologies.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  6) Remote Sensing, Detection and Tracking of Oil in and Under Ice - Increased offshore exploration, development and production are planned for the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea's.  Methods fore the remote sensing, detection and tracking oil in and under ice need to be investigated.  MMS is seeking proposals on new and innovative equipment and technologies for the remote sensing, detection and tracking of oil in and under ice in the Arctic. This equipment shall be able to locate and accurately map the location of the oil.  Maps shall be ARCGIS compatible.  MMS seeks proposals to test and evaluate these technologies in a range of ice conditions.  Focus should be on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey and/or through a series of field tests conducted in the Arctic environment.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  7) Detection and Tracking of Submerged Oil in Deepwater on the Outer Continental Shelf - MMS is seeking information and proposals on new and innovative equipment and technologies for the remote sensing and surveillance of spilled oil from sub-sea releases in deepwater.  This equipment shall detect and track location of sub-sea spills from deepwater systems including flow line/risers, umbilical, and seafloor pipelines.  The equipment shall be able to locate and accurately map the submerged oil. MMS seeks proposals to test and evaluate these technologies through a series of field tests conducted in deepwater.  8) Oil Spill Chemical Dispersant Research - MMS is seeking proposals that will facilitate the use of dispersants on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  Dispersant effectiveness testing in the laboratory is not always representative of dispersant effectiveness in the field.  It is difficult to determine the true effectiveness of dispersants that have not been tested on actual spills.  MMS is seeking proposals to define and test the methodologies used to correlate dispersant effectiveness tests in the laboratory to the effectiveness rates in real spills.  Of particular interest are methods to realistically assess dispersant effectiveness in the field as a function of dispersant type, sea state, salinity, oil type and weathering state, dispersant-to-oil ratio, and environmental conditions.  9) Oil Spill Chemical Dispersant Research - MMS is seeking proposals that would identify which chemical/physical parameters of crude oils necessary to predict it's dispersibility over time as it weathers.  Due to the volume of crude oils produced in the Gulf of Mexico, it is not realistic to require detailed testing of each oil to determine the "window of opportunity for dispersant use as it weathers.  MMS seeks a standard testing protocol/methodology which would provide the major parameters of oil that would give an indication of the anticipated window of opportunity for dispersant use as  it weathers over time.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to oil spill response, safety and pollution practices related to offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues and/or other issues related to the offshore operations. Multi-year funding of projects is acceptable.

<DESC>The GSA IT Acquisition Services center plans to procure off GSA Federal Supply Financial and Business Services Schedule on a sole source basis with Dun and Bradstreet for information services that support the Integrated Acquisition Environment Business Partner Network.  The federal government has had an ongoing requirement to identify and report on corporate relationships and linkages.  Corporate lineage has long been the responsibility of the Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC) from its inception in 1978.  FPDC has had a long-term relationship with Dun & Bradstreet to provide ongoing linkage information to fulfill a number of reports requirements and data mining requirements.  One report, known as Top 100 Report, is an annual report that publishes corporate data listing 100 firms who have received the most aggregate award obligations in a given fiscal year.  This report presents the firms in order of their respective total aggregate obligations. The Dun & Bradstreet relationship has been critical to the success of this type report.  In addition, the linkage data has been used by FPDC to help identify business subsidiaries of specific companies by request of any number of Agencies and Congress to determine relationships as it relates to economic impacts to specific Congressional Districts, research with regard to size of corporation, novation research to establish the total business impact to firms indicating a legal change or transfer of assets, and research as it relates to debarment issues and the subsidiary corporations impacted as a result of any debarment decision or responsibility test prior to award. As of October 1, 2003, FPDC decommission the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), and replaced this system with the Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation (FPDS-NG) for the fiscal year 2004 data.  In addition, the linkages process responsibility once part of the FPDS is being transferred to the Business Partner Network (BPN).  The BPN business area is both vendor and business partnered centric.  It collects information on the vendor and business partner that is shared thought the federal acquisition business space and across the Integrated Acquisition Environment.  The linkage data provided by Dun & Bradstreet when used in the BPN will provide a seamless transition from FPDS and increased quality of data with real-time updates to parental and subsidiary relationships of a corporate enterprise.  In addition, Agencies will be able to leverage the linkages to corporate rollups based on parental and subsidiary relationships as it relates to their individual corporate partners.  This requirement was not available to the Agencies in FPDS. The DUNS number, linkage monitoring, and database information services are proprietary to and controlled by Dun and Bradstreet.  The government’s previous attempts of setting up a Contractor Establishment Code (CEC) independently of the commercial marketplace proved to be infeasible and costly.  No other source of data exists on a comprehensive basis; that is, other services are available on the basis of the purchase card (p-card); however, p-card data is not comprehensive of the entire marketplace.  Only Dun and Bradstreet grant customers a non-exclusive perpetual, limited license to use the DUNS Numbers solely for identification purposes and only for a vendor’s internal business use.  The Dun and Bradstreet Number Linkage database services also grants customers the right to distribute Headquarters/Parent DUNS, Domestic Ultimate DUNS, and Global Ultimate DUNS for federal procurement purposes only, including matching BPN records to FPDS and other Federal Systems.  The following GSA Schedule services shall be purchased:  D&B Software License (enterprise license for the Data Integration Tool Kit (DITK), which provides the ability to access D&B's real time database and up to 20 hours of phone or e-mail technical support.  Access to D&B's Government Customer Resource Center.  Real time validation services and access to D&B through the DITK Federal Register (FedReg) users.  Batch file processing of Executive Branch level information that feeds the FedReg database.  Access to D&B Federal Family Tree Quality Assurance services.  DUNS ad hoc request services (i.e., DUNS Numbering the locations for the Administrative Office of Courts. and Linkage monitoring -- novation alerts.  Monitoring linked records for changes that will assist the Novations process by identifying key changes to corporate parents, which may require novation.  This requirement will result in a single task order under the Federal Supply Schedule Financial Services Contracts program.

<CONTACT>James E. Watkins 202-781-3957 James E. Watkins 202-781-3957
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole source, cost-type contract to Bluefin Robotics Corporation, 301 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, for the development of the Battlespace Preparation Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (BPAUV).  Bluefin has supported the Office of Naval Research (ONR) technology demonstration by adapting their commercial undersea vehicle to the Mine Warfare Area.  The BPAUV  has shown military utility during fleet exercises and technology demonstrations.  This procurement takes advantage of prior ONR investment in the BPAUV system.  A technical data package does exist which is not currently suitable for competition, and Bluefin claims proprietary rights on the data for the basic vehicle.  The BPAUV is intended as an autonomous unmanned system capable of meeting clandestine intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and survey requirements.  The plan is to buy one system with an option for a second in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007.  The system will consist of two vehicles, an ISO van, and support equipment.  The advertised delivery destination is to the Littoral Combat Ship in December 2006.  The BPAUV will be launched and recovered from the Littoral Combat Ship Flight 0, and provide bathymetry data and mine like contacts to the Mine Warfare Environmental  Data Analysis Library (MEDAL) database.  Contract award is anticipated in late first quarter FY 2005, with an intended duration through FY07.  This is not a request for proposals, nor a promise to issue a request for proposals.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>John Miller 850-235-5399 ,or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for, technology assessment, program management and engineering services support for Increment 1 development of the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) system to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), an independent non-profit organization, of Johnstown, PA. The period of performance will be for two years. The proposed contract will provide for both term form and completion form delivery orders and will contain Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions that prohibit the contractor from participating in production of the DJC2 Increment 2 and beyond systems. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. CTC, as an independent non-profit corporation, has established itself as DOD’s indepe ndent third-party technology verification center. This unique competence has been used on numerous occasions by the DOD to ensure accurate and independently verified decisions are being made to transfer the optimum technology to DOD installations.  This competence has also been used to certify the performance of materials and equipment for addition to the DOD buyers list.  Additionally, CTC has been intimately involved in the design, development and deployment of the DJC2 prototype.  The DJC2 delivery schedule is compressed and critical.  It is imperative that CTC’s experience with the DJC2 prototype be leveraged to prevent program duplication and unacceptable delay.   Additionally,  CTC operates four major Defense Centers of Excellence:  the National Center for Excellence in Metalworking Technology (NCEMT); the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE); the  National Applied Software Engineering Center (NASEC); and the Systems Of Systems Engineering Center of Excellence (SoSECE).  These centers maintain essential capabilities in materials and processing, environmental engineering, electronic commerce, information management, software engineering, Systems of Systems Engineering, laboratory operations and techniques, and structured training for technicians, professionals, and others. This provides DJC2 with access to capabilities directly applicable to technology transition.  CTC provides a means for applying critical advanced environmental, manufacturing, information, and software technologies to the solution of technical problems that directly face DJC2 during Increment 1. CTC has developed state-of-the-art technology and services in virtual reality, 3-D scientific visualization and collaborative engineering to provide cost-effecti ve solutions that support the decision-making process that are of direct interest to the DJC2 development phase. These technological services have been applied to a variety of domains including battlefield visualization and simulations, process and product design, real-time network monitoring, mission familiarization and architectural design.  NAICS Code is 541330.  Contract Specialist: John Miller, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001 (904) 235-5399, FAX (904) 234-4251.   Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for NASA-Wide Agency License for the 2004 Linkage Excellence in Management and Leadership Series Live via satellite and videoconferenceing.  The license will allow all NASA centers to downlink the series with no restrictions on the number of attendees viewing the program. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Linkage, Inc., Lexington MA as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  This satellite series includes presentations from top management and leadership experts.  This program is the only known satelite delivered management and leadership training program that will allow NASA managers and supervisors to interact with experts in the fields of management and leadership.  It would take substantial duplication of time and effort for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 8/13/2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The in-stream measurement of flow sensors will be used for the flow monitoring network for an ongoing project at the Shepherd Creek. The flo-tote sensor is flexible in its application, as the sensor is a "smart" type that can interface with common data loggers, and allows for cable lengths up to 1,000 feet.  This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA  source research indicates Marsh-McBirney is the only known source able to satisfy the government's requirements. As the manufacturer of the the Marsh-McBirney model 270 flow meter that is already in use at several sites along the Shepherd Creek, Marsh-McBirney is the only known source capable of  supplying in-stream flow measuring sensors that are compatible with the model 270.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of supplying such items. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days  of electronic posting of this notice (before Tuesday August 10, 2004 at 10:00 AM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose  of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC), Butner, North Carolina,  intends  to issue a sole-source purchase order to Sun Nuclear Corporation to provide MapCheck IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy) Patient Plan QA System.  The Government believes that Sun Nuclear  is the only manufacturer that will satisfy the agency requirement. This is a sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). The MapCheck IMRT Patient Plan Q/A System is a is a 2-dimensional therapy beam measurement system intended for quick and precise verification of the dose distribution resulting from an IMRT plan. Beam measurement is accomplished using a grid of 445 diode detectors that are housed between two sheets of solid acrylic. The MapCheck measures the integrated absolute dose at all detector locations, each of which has been corrected to the central detector sensitivity. This measured dose map is then automatically normalized and compared to a normalized imported treatment plan dose map, all in less than one minute.   The NAICS Number 334517 applies with a  size standard of 500 employees. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes, however; any firm that believes that it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 4 days of publication of this notice. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries may be sent to Mary Doyle, S.C.S.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to continue leasing six (6) copies of SSASIM Model and GEMINI Software for one (1) year from Policy Simulation Group, Inc (PSI), Washington, DC.  Further, the SSASIM and GEMINI licenses will allow SSA to acquire software modifications from PSI as the need arises for more efficient policy valuations in retirement (OASI), disability (DI), and income assistance programs.

PSI is the only known source with authority and expertise to provide and modify the "software" as SSA requires. 

Any other vendor claiming to have requisite authority and expertise to provide or modify the "software" must submit verifiable information that supports such assertion.  Conversely, any other vendor that can provide comparable commercial off-the-shelf-(COTS) software must submit verifiable information (i.e., product literature, customer references, and product price) on the relevant capabilities and support for such COTS software.  Any suggested COTS software package must be accessible to SSA for at least three (3) years, cost less than $300,000.00, and satisfy the following requirements: 

General
Simulate the impact of policy changes to SSA's Trust Funds, particularly projecting actuarial balances using a similar methodology to that used by the Office of the Chief Actuary. The model will be used to estimate the effects of policy changes on individuals and the economy and as a comparison for program cost projections made by the Office of the Chief Actuary. Below are listed the various elements we require.

1. Activity One:

Produce 75-year actuarial cost projections (from baseline data—such as age-gender earnings and gross domestic product---that is obtained for a given year) under alternative calculations.  Generate an alternative calculation that literally combines the two Trust Funds (OASI and DI) into a third, theoretical OASDI Trust Fund to produce 75-year actuarial balances.  In addition, upon trust fund exhaustion, two alternative discount rate assumptions should be available: (1) rates based on the return that would be realized given the Trust Fund asset allocation policy for that year and (2) rates based on the assumption that an exhausted Trust Fund will simply borrow at the Treasury bond rate from the Treasury's general fund. 

2. Activity Two:

Specify lifestyle earning profiles for eighteen individuals by birth cohort and simulate a wide variety of OASI program experience statistics for each of them (including the effects of their being married under different policies).  The COTS package must allow model to accept a weighting probability for each individual and combine the eighteen individual statistics into an overall (population-like) statistic.

The COTS model must be able to run in a stochastic-assumption mode and/or an endogenous-growth mode.  The macrosimulation model will also need an embedded cohort model, which uses standard dynamic microsimulation methods with a small, unrepresentative sample of individuals. The cohort model should be embedded inside the macroeconomic model in the sense that the macroeconomic model determines the macroeconomic and demographic environment within which individual lives are simulated.

3. Activity Three:

The COTS macroeconomic model must produce estimates of program income and cost for both OASI and DI and must be able to simulate OASI and DI benefits for individuals and families.

4. Activity Four:

The COTS model must produce detailed output files for a cohort sample of 100,000 life histories (plus spouses and children) in less than ten minutes on a standard personal computer.

Responses to this announcement must be received within ten (10) days after this publication date and should refer to synopsis number 04-1003 .

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Soliciting From a Single Source, to develop atom-based linewidth standards to assist in the calibration of linewidth metrology tools and the development of unique interferometry capabilities.  This is a sole source requirement as the University has already provided guidance and essential support in the development of surface preparation methods and scanning tunneling microscope operation of silicon atomic-crystal lattice counting methods, the precursor to developing atom-based linewidth standards; furthermore, the University has contributed extensively to the automated sample preparation and ultra-high vacuum measurement of the crystal lattices and significantly contributed technically in developing NIST’s diode laser interferometry system.  A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about Aug. 6, 2004 with a 1-year performance period.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>UPDATE******UPDATE*****UPDATE The solicitation, drawings, specifications, wage determination, and Addendum #1  have been uploaded to PIXs 7/16/2004. UPDATE*****UPDATE*****UPDATE The response date has been updated from 7/15/2004 to 8/16/2004. UPDATE*****UDATE******UPDATE The work consists of the ability to furnish all materials and perform all labor  required to provide power supply for Compression Aero Research Laboratory  (CARL) in facilities 20018E and 08185.  Project scope is to construct  underground cable ducts and provide new medium voltage cables to connect the  CARL test apparatus being relocated in Facility 20018E to the base power system  at substation C.  This work is supporting lab equipment installation.  It is  recommended that only a qualified electrical contractor with experience in this  specific type of work perform this task. The project includes associated  architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and  miscellaneous work.  Special requirements/concerns:  This project involves installing new concrete  encased duct banks in existing streets, and installing a new 15kV circuit from  Substation C to Building 20018E.  It is important that the work be completed  within the performance period without interruption, and that no unscheduled  power outages occur.  Traditionally, most medium voltage work has been done by  utilities.  It is vastly different from performing low voltage (120 or 480V)  commercial work.  The safety rules and the codes involved are completely  different for medium voltage systems versus low voltage systems.  Faults on  medium voltage systems are much more destructive physically, and much more  likely to result in death in case of accidental contact, therefore the  different rules.  Safety is the primary concern, and this work requires a very  specialized contractor with the proper experience. The estimated price range is between 250,000 to 500,000.  Period of performance  is 240 calendar days. NAICS CODE:  238210.  The size standard $12M. This is a  restricted procurement in accordance with the HUB Zone Act of 1997 (13 CFR  126), 15 U.S.C. 631 note. In accordance with DFARS 252.204.7004, the contractor  must be registered in the CCR prior to award of solicitations issued after 31  May 1998. Tel: 1-888-CCR-2423.  FAX:  1-703-696-0213. Every solicitation issued  after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required  Central Contractor Registration".  Registration may be completed via the  DUNS/CCR Website: http://www.ccr.gov/. NOTES:  1.  The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available on  the World Wide Web on or about 15 July 2004.  The web-site address is  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  2.  Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be  provided.  You may, however, download and print the file from the World Wide  Web.  3.  There is no fee for this solicitation.  4.

<DESC>UPDATE******UPDATE*****UPDATE The solicitation, drawings, specifications, wage determination, and Addendum No. 1  have been uploaded to PIXs 7/16/2004. UPDATE*****UPDATE*****UPDATE The response date has been updated from 7/15/2004 to 8/16/2004. UPDATE*****UDATE******UPDATE The work consists of the ability to furnish all materials and perform all labor  required to provide power supply for Compression Aero Research Laboratory  (CARL) in facilities 20018E and 08185.  Project scope is to construct  underground cable ducts and provide new medium voltage cables to connect the  CARL test apparatus being relocated in Facility 20018E to the base power system  at substation C.  This work is supporting lab equipment installation.  It is  recommended that only a qualified electrical contractor with experience in this  specific type of work perform this task. The project includes associated  architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and  miscellaneous work.  Special requirements/concerns:  This project involves installing new concrete  encased duct banks in existing streets, and installing a new 15kV circuit from  Substation C to Building 20018E.  It is important that the work be completed  within the performance period without interruption, and that no unscheduled  power outages occur.  Traditionally, most medium voltage work has been done by  utilities.  It is vastly different from performing low voltage (120 or 480V)  commercial work.  The safety rules and the codes involved are completely  different for medium voltage systems versus low voltage systems.  Faults on  medium voltage systems are much more destructive physically, and much more  likely to result in death in case of accidental contact, therefore the  different rules.  Safety is the primary concern, and this work requires a very  specialized contractor with the proper experience. The estimated price range is between 250,000 to 500,000.  Period of performance  is 240 calendar days. NAICS CODE:  238210.  The size standard $12M. This is a  restricted procurement in accordance with the HUB Zone Act of 1997 (13 CFR  126), 15 U.S.C. 631 note.

<DESC>UPDATE (7-21-04) Questions and Answers INDUSTRY DAY 10 MARCH 2004 1. QUESTION: Will contractor be allowed to bring seats in for a pre-RFP evaluation?    ANSWER: Yes 2. QUESTION: Will the contractor be able to attend/participate in the formal evaluation?    ANSWER: The contractor will be required to install their production representative seat but will not be allowed to participate in the formal evaluation and measurement process.  You will be allowed to observe and answer any questions that the Government might have while conducting the measurements/accommodations but not participate. 3. QUESTION: Will the Government provide T-38C cockpit geometry?    ANSWER: CDs with T-38C cockpit geometry were mailed to respective offerors on 19 Jun 2004.   4. QUESTION: Will formal cockpit evaluation include other activities such as     maintenance?    ANSWER:  Not formally during the cockpit evaluation -- to be completed as part of the source selection. 5. QUESTION: Will there be an aft seat forward visibility evaluation?    ANSWER: Yes 6. QUESTION: Will the requirement be for a three mode or four mode ISS?    ANSWER: Information will be released in the RFP. 7. QUESTION: Is it desirable that seat adjustment exceeds limits currently imposed by aircraft controls to accommodate future aircraft modifications?    ANSWER: Requirements for Increment 1 is that the accommodation is to be no worse than currently exists in T-38C with Northrop seat.  Any increase in accommodation resulting from Increment 1 will be considered as part of a best value decision. 8. QUESTION: When will the Indian Head Test Program on the modified M25A1 thruster be completed and the report issued?  Are there any plans for a follow- on program to evaluate the effect of increased thrust on the canopy jettison performance and the time taken to clear the escape path?    ANSWER: The testing has been completed, with a test report scheduled to be available by 02 Aug 2004.  The Government plans no follow-up program. 9. QUESTION: Will the results of the Indian Head EPC technology feasibility study be reported separate, or is it awaiting completion of the updated  thruster testing?   Are there any preliminary conclusions about which  technologies may or may not be feasible?    ANSWER: Indian Head EPC technology survey study was briefed at 10 March 2004 Industry Day.  The EPC study was initiated to gain insight into what technologies are available, not necessarily feasible.  It was meant to be a review of potential EPC concepts.  Feasibility of any offered system will be determined by the programs performance parameters that are a part of the forthcoming RFP.  The thruster study is a separate effort.  No conclusions about feasibility, with reference to use on the T-38C, will be made based on  either study.	 10. QUESTION: Would the Government, under any circumstances, find a canopy cutting/fracturing system acceptable for the T-38 ESUP?     ANSWER: The Government will not provide/define design solutions to the offerors; only requirements are defined.  However, all risks associated with any technical solutions, as proposed, will be analyzed and evaluated during the source selection along with any and all corresponding costs (e.g. acquisition costs, maintenance and support costs, etc.). 11. QUESTION: Will all anthropometric/reach measurements be taken with the seat full-up/down?  Is there any danger this could disguise an improvement achieved in positions that *match* the full-up/down extremes of the current Northrop seat?     ANSWER: The measurements will be done at the design eye, full up, full down positions thus we can then predict accommodation at all seat positions.   Additionally, measurements will be taken at full aft to full forward in 1 inch  increments. 12. QUESTION: What are the plans for the upgrade (time + location)? Will the upgrade be accomplished (1) base by base, (2) mixed base support, (3) all updated within x months?     ANSWER: The upgrade will be accomplished base by base. 13. QUESTION: Please expand on the Government s intent for new MA25 thruster?   A statement was made that this is not a developmental program but it appears that the Government is developing a new thruster system - please clarify?  Is it the Government's intent to provide this new thruster system as GFAE after development is completed or based upon the study results, is it the USAF's intent that each contractor bid the production implementation of their escape path configuration?     ANSWER: The Indian Head MA25A1 efforts are meant to determine if the basic component can be safely upgraded with increased energetic loading and what performance can be expected with such upgrades.  The Government will supply this data to industry for informational purposes only, the contractor s may use the Indian Head information as they see fit.  It is not the intent of the Government to provide the thruster as GFAE. 14. QUESTION: Discuss current 50 KT speed requirement for canopy removal/chute.  Is the 50KT needed to remove the canopy or is it needed to achieve parachute deployment?  Which is the critical factor, one or both?     ANSWER: With the current seat and current system timing, both factors are critical. 15. QUESTION: What metrics will be used to evaluate seat performance?     ANSWER: This information will be contained in the RFP. 16. QUESTION: Has the modified M25A1 resulted in an increased physical envelope?  If yes, has the availability of the increased envelope been confirmed or evaluated (in the aircraft)?     ANSWER: The modification of the M25A1 is internal.  There is no change to the size/shape of the unit.  No evaluation of the M25A1 on the aircraft has taken place or is planned by the Government. 17. QUESTION: What testing is being done on the thruster in the area of complete mechanism/linkage to determine what, if any, distortion or failures occur?     ANSWER: No such testing has been undertaken or is planned by the Government. 18. QUESTION: The Government has projected approximately $40M in FY05 - how will it be spent?  Can you share any current budgetary projections?     ANSWER: Our intent in FY05 is to initiate compatibility testing and purchase initial seats/ISS depending on the FY05 appropriation.  The projected profile is to buy seats/ISS for 60 aircraft per year and install in the following year. //END OF UPDATE// For more information on ESUP--T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/ESUP/ESUP.asp

<DESC>The Solicitation Number 04-R-0082 is amended for the following:  For submission requirements, I included the megabyte size restriction for Part I of the SF 330.  I didn't think it was necessary to worry about the size of the Part II, but now I realiz e that they have to submit a Part II for each team member (subcontractor) so I think we should change the wording as follows:  Instead of saying, *Part I of the SF 330 must not exceed 5 Megabytes.......* That sentence should read, *The entire submission sh ould be submitted as a single file using Microsoft Word (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) and must not exceed 5 Megabytes.*  Then the next sentence giving page limits for Part I may remain as is.  All other information remains the same.  Closing date remains 8/23/2004 at 6:30 a.m. Questions concerning SF330 submittal and debriefings should be directed to Ms. Lucie Hughes at 912-652-5645. Original and modification 1 of this solicitation have a posted date of 23 July 2004.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), BULLET TRAP SYSTEMS.   The FBI requests information from manufacturers and other interested parties concerning bullet trap systems suited for law enforcement small arms ranges having at least 20 shooting lanes.  Information submitted concerning bullet trap systems which have been installed on military small arms ranges having at least 20 shooting lanes will be accepted and may be considered as well.  Submissions are not restricted to bullet trap systems which have any particular mode of operation - ie. the submission of information for either "wet" trap systems or "dry" trap systems are welcome.  Further, submissions for bullet trap systems which have bullet/bullet fragment collection and conveyance capability as well as for systems which do not have collection/conveyance capability are welcome.  The FBI however is only interested in receiving - and will only consider - information for bullet trap systems which have an established history of performance on law enforcement (of military) small arms ranges which are at least 20 shooting lanes wide.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation and further is not to be construed as an express and/or implied agreement for the Government to enter into a contract either now or in the future.  The primary objective of this RFI is to gather information that increases the efficiency of possible future procurement actions by improving the FBI's knowledge of available bullet trap systems suited for law enforcement small arms ranges.  The Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  The information provided may be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs and may influence future procurement strategy and/or actions.  The Government may use the submissions provided in response to this RFI for whatever purpose(s) it so chooses and may include but is not limited to;  (1) establishing the marketplace for bullet traps which appear to meet the needs of the FBI, (2) limiting competition for future procurement actions, (3) sharing information with other law enforcement agencies, and (4) comparing information submitted as the baseline against which actual trap system performance is compared as part of a possible future bullet trap system test and evaluation study.  Lack of response to this RFI in whole and/or in part may be interpreted as a lack of market interest and/or capability to provide bullet traps.  Lack of submission of fully responsive, detailed  information for every numbered/lettered item below may be interpreted as evidence that the bullet trap system has poor performance and/or no performance capability with regard to that numbered/lettered item.  The Government does not intend to respond to submissions except as may be determined necessary and appropriate by the FBI in order to clarify information submitted and/or to otherwise seek answers to questions which may arise upon FBI review of the submitted information.  Submitters are advised that the FBI intends to contact current law enforcement (and/or current military) bullet trap system owner's and/or user's and conduct inquiries as to the owner's and/or user's experience with the bullet trap system submitted in response to this request for information.  All submissions will become the property of the US Government and will not be returned.  The FBI reserves the right to share submitted information in whole and/or part with any other party(ies) - except for any proprietary or confidential information submitted.  Any proprietary or confidential information submitted should be clearly annotated as such.  Do not submit samples;  the FBI will not guarantee the return of any samples provided.  

Background: The FBI conducts small arms training on various firearms ranges around the country.  These various firearms ranges are used for firearms training, qualification and tactical training.  Some of these firearms ranges are indoor ranges, some are outdoor ranges and others are fully baffled, all-weather ranges.  Ranges generally vary from approximately 20 shooting lanes wide to 56 shooting lanes wide.  The shooting distance in these ranges may vary from weapon discharge at the target line to weapon discharge at the 50 yard firing line.  Ranges are subject to up to approximately 15,000 rounds of ammunition discharged per shooting lane per month, or 180,000 rounds per lane per year.  Rounds discharged on these ranges primarily consist of either lead based or non lead based 9 mm, 40 caliber, 45 caliber, .223, 12 gauge shotgun 9 pellet OO buckshot and 12 gauge shotgun 1 ounce slug, however other caliber rounds and/or round types may also be discharged on FBI ranges on occasion.

Provide the name of every law enforcement (or military) owner of the exact bullet trap 	system proposed which has been installed in the United States and which is at least 20 	shooting lanes wide.  	For each owner, indicate the year in which the system was first put 	into service, the geographic location of the bullet trap system, the number of shooting 	lanes served by the system and indicate whether the system is installed indoors, outdoors 	or in a fully baffled, all weather range.  For each owner, provide a current point of contact 	name, address and telephone number.

5.  Bullet Trap System Durability;

A.	If moving rounds come into either direct and/or indirect contact with steel 	elements/components of the bullet trap system, identify the	grade, hardness and thickness of steel used on each surface of the bullet trap system which is exposed to either direct or indirect contact with moving projectiles/moving projectile fragments.

B.	Has any impact surface of the bullet trap system - in whole or part - ever had to be 	replaced within the first year of system operation due to impact surface cracking or other 	mode of failure?  If so, indicate what was the approximate number of rounds discharged 	into the system before failure?

C.	What is the maximum number of lead based rounds/hour (using a caliber mix having	an equal number of rounds discharged from 12 gauge slug, 12 gauge 9 pellet OO 		buckshot, 45 caliber, 40 caliber, 9 mm and .223) that a single lane of the bullet trap 	system can accommodate without any type of system failure such as bullet 		collection/retrieval system clogging or other type of system failure?

D.	What is the life expectancy of the bullet trap system in terms of number of rounds 	received before system needs to be replaced and/or refurbished in some fashion (such as 	replacing impact surfaces)?  This life expectancy is to be based on the life of previously 	installed systems.  Identify law enforcement owner(s) by name, location and telephone 	number whose installed system validates the claimed life expectancy.    

6.  Bullet Trap System Health and Safety;

A.	Describe and quantify the bullet trap systems' airborne lead containment/minimization 	capabilities - if any.

B.	Describe and quantify the bullet trap system's lead dust containment/minimization 	capabilities - if any.

Identify the peak noise level of system operation (as measured on the dB(a) scale 5 feet in front of the leading edge of the trap system) when the system is in a fully operational mode (with no shooting activity taking place).  Identify the personnel and equipment used to determine the peak noise level reported.    

D.	Identify, fully describe and quantify all waste streams associated with use of bullet trap 	system (in preparing response to this item, assume that lead based ammunition is used).  	For each waste stream, advise if human exposure to that waste stream is known to be 	potentially hazardous to human health and/or to the environment and cite associated 	regulations for handling and disposal of each waste stream. 

E.	Explain the extent to which personnel are required to come in contact with, handle or 	otherwise be exposed to spent lead projectiles and/or other hazardous material(s) during 	operation and/or maintenance of the system.  Describe what protective measures should 
	be taken by operation and maintenance personnel.  Describe the manner of lawful 	disposition of each hazardous waste stream and provide an estimated annual cost 		associated with the lawful disposition of each hazardous waste stream (estimated annual 	cost to be based on 180,000 lead based rounds discharged per year per lane on a 28 lane 	range).

F.	Fully describe how bullet splashback/ricochet and bullet fragment splashback is 		minimized by the bullet trap system regardless of the angle at which a round is fired.

G.	Identify how close a shooter can stand to the leading edge of the bullet trap system 	without risk of being struck by bullet splash back/ricochet and bullet fragment splashback 	while discharging rounds regardless of the angle at which a round is fired?

H.	Identify the ignition temperature, flame spread and smoke development ratings for each 	non metal material used as part of the trap system.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation and further this notice is not to be construed as an express and/or implied agreement for the Government to enter into a contract either now or in the future.  The primary objective of this RFI is to gather information that increases the efficiency of possible future procurement actions by improving the FBI's knowledge of available on-line information database retrieval services.  The Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  The information provided may be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs and may influence future procurement strategy and/or actions.  The Government may use the submissions provided in response to this RFI for whatever purpose(s) it so chooses and may include but is not limited to:  (1) establishing the marketplace for on-line information database retrieval services, (2) limiting competition for future procurement actions, (3) sharing information with other Government agencies, and (4) comparing information submitted as the baseline against which on-line information database retrieval service performance is compared as part of a possible future
on-line information database retrieval services test and evaluation study.  Lack of response to this RFI in whole and/or in part may be interpreted as a lack of market interest and/or capability to provide on-line information database retrieval services.  Lack of submission of fully responsive, detailed information for every numbered/lettered item above may be interpreted as evidence that the on-line information database retrieval service has no performance capability with regard to that numbered/lettered item.  The Government does not intend to respond to submissions except as may be determined necessary and appropriate by the FBI in order to clarify information submitted and/or to otherwise seek answers to questions which may arise upon review of the submitted information.  All submissions will become the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  The FBI reserves the right to share submitted information in whole and/or part with any party(ies)-expect for any proprietary or confidential information submitted.  Any proprietary or confidential information submitted should be clearly annotated as such.  Do not submit samples; the FBI will not guarantee the return of any samples provided.  Responses to this request for information shall be formatted to correspond to each of the numbered/lettered items listed above.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information from potential sources, comments, and inputs concerning the availability, cost, and specifications of a Ka-Band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project.  SDO is the first mission under the Living with a Star (LWS) Program as part of the Sun Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of 3 instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing our understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105°W longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and currently, is scheduled for launch in April 2008.  SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high rate data (150 Mbps, Reed Solomon and Rate ½ Convolutionally Encoded). The transmitted data will SQPSK modulate a Ka-band carrier (26.5 GHz) in the SDO modulator/exciter. The exciter will drive the TWTA, which will generate 5-10 Watts RF into a 0.75 meter diameter reflector antenna (a single output power level will be specified in the final specification). Other preliminary specifications for the SDO TWTA are as follows:  1. Spacecraft bus voltage: 28 +/- 7 volts  2. RF input power: +0 dBm min.  3. RF output power (including output isolator): +37 to +40 dBm min.  4. Output frequency/bandwidth: ~26.5 GHz +/- 200 MHz min.  5. Gain flatness (peak-to-peak) across band: 1.0 dB max. 6. AM/PM: &lt;= 10 degrees/dB 7. Phase nonlinearity across band (peak-to-peak): 3.5 degrees  8. Operational temperature range (baseplate): 0 to +40 C  9. RF input connector: K-female (2.9 mm jack)  10. RF output connector: WR-34  11. TWTA telemetry: internal temperature, RF output power, To Be Determined (TBD) electrical interface  12. Input and output VSWRs: 1.5:1 or better  13. Random Vibration test profile:  [PLEASE DOWNLOAD MS WORD VERSION OF THIS NOTICE FOR CORRECTLY FORMATTED TABLES.] 14. Shock requirement: Maximum expected shock environment is as follows: [PLEASE DOWNLOAD MS WORD VERSION OF THIS NOTICE FOR CORRECTLY FORMATTED TABLES.] 15. Parts radiation requirement: Dependent on enclosure material/thickness, with 40 mil contribution from spacecraft. For example, radiation requirement is ~200 krad total dose with a 100 mil thick Al enclosure, or ~20 krad total dose with a 200 mil thick Al enclosure.  16. Parts quality requirement: Quality Level 1 (per GSFC 311-INST-001) parts shall be selected when readily available. For those parts not readily available, Quality Level 2 parts, with additional testing as required by GSFC, shall be acceptable.  17. Total mass: 3 kg. max.  18. Required DC input power: &lt;41 Watts for 5 W RF output, &lt;70 Watts for 10 W RF output NASA/GSFC may contract for up to three (3) flight Ka-band TWTAs. However, in order to accurately specify the requirements of the TWTA, the SDO project seeks feedback from industry regarding the above specifications. Responses from industry that have expertise in providing spaceflight Ka-band TWTAs and associated equipment is encouraged. In addition to the technical questions above, please indicate your company’s relevant history associated with the development of Ka Band space flight or military hardware. Also, feedback regarding any other relevant specifications not mentioned is requested. Are any of the specifications not realistic with respect to today’s technology, a significant cost driver to achieve that performance, or unnecessarily over specified to achieve the necessary performance?  All information received will be combined and used for government procurement and planning purposes. Sources are urged to describe their approach in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information may be appropriate. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large or small; a list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to: Mr. Michael Powers. Procurement related questions should be Ms. Lorrie Eakin.  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in Internet "Note A".   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. An Ombudsman has been appointed--see NASA Specific Numbered Note "B".  This can be accessed at the following URL:	 http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html   .

The City of Roseville is requesting a sole source purchase of wat er meter materials from various vendors associated with their 1999 WRDA Project.

The Invensus meters are the SRII Displacement meter for Cold Water.  Invensus has been the sole source supplier of meters used in Rosevil le since the late 1980s and has provided exceptional service.  The parts inventory, staff training and maintenance parts required to maintain the existing inventory of meters as well as those added in the future have led to the decision to standardize on a  single meter and associated materials manufacturer.  Lids and boxes are the industry equivalent of a Christy N-16, nominal size 11 inch x 21 inch x 12 inch .  However, these boxes and lids are sole source to Armorcast because they are the only approved so urce of polymer boxes and polymer ERT lids.

NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.	This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about advanced concepts that are based on satellite communications for future air-ground communications systems providing air traffic services (ATS).  This RFI is closely associated with the RFI NNC04PRA002L that was posted on June 18, 2004 and closed on July 19, 2004.  This RFI focuses on concepts specifically related to the use of communications satellites in providing future air-ground communications in any or all aviation flight segments (surface, terminal, en-route and oceanic).	For the purposes of this RFI, ATS includes the following services: separation assurance; air traffic control advisory; traffic management synchronization; navigation; airspace management; emergency and alerting; flight planning; infrastructure/information management; and traffic management strategic flow.  Transition to this future system would begin in the 2015 – 2020 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received from this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative Future Communications Study between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Eurocontrol.	The FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study will help to define and design a global air-ground communications system that provides for world-wide interoperability among all ATS users.  The work plan and associated terms of reference for the FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study can be found at http://www.eurocontrol.int/faa-euro/AP-group-meetings/ap17/ap17.htm   NASA GRC is responsible for Technical Theme 3 in the Future Communications Study work plan, to investigate new technologies for mobile communication.

NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about advanced concepts that are based on satellite communications for future air-ground communications systems providing air traffic services (ATS).  This RFI is closely associated with the RFI NNC04PRA002L that was posted on June 18, 2004 and closed on July 19, 2004.  This RFI focuses on concepts specifically related to the use of communications satellites in providing future air-ground communications in any or all aviation flight segments (surface, terminal, en-route and oceanic).	For the purposes of this RFI, ATS includes the following services: separation assurance; air traffic control advisory; traffic management synchronization; navigation; airspace management; emergency and alerting; flight planning; infrastructure/information management; and traffic management strategic flow.  Transition to this future system would begin in the 2015 – 2020 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received from this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative Future Communications Study between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Eurocontrol.	The FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study will help to define and design a global air-ground communications system that provides for world-wide interoperability among all ATS users.  The work plan and associated terms of reference for the FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study can be found at http://www.eurocontrol.int/faa-euro/AP-group-meetings/ap17/ap17.htm   NASA GRC is responsible for Technical Theme 3 in the Future Communications Study work plan, to investigate new technologies for mobile communication.  This RFI is intended to provide input for conducting Task 3.1, Technology Pre-screening.  The Advanced Engineering & Sciences Division of ITT Industries, Inc. is under contract to assist NASA GRC in the technology pre-screening task.  They and other contractors of NASA and the FAA will have access to the information submitted for the purpose of conducting the technology pre-screening process.   NASA GRC seeks information on candidate system solutions for mobile communications that can be used for ATS both domestically and internationally.  Both current capabilities (based on existing or planned products) and potential future concepts are encouraged in response to this RFI.  Concepts based on terrestrial broadcast, air-to-air relay, and/or satellite relay are acceptable as inputs to the technology pre-screening process. It is desirable that information provided to describe the advanced air-ground communications system concepts include: •	A technical description of the system solution including but limited to: air interface; end-to-end latency (pilot-to-controller and controller-to-pilot if asymmetric); ATS communications services provided; protocols; network topology; spectrum required; security features; and any simplifying assumptions needed to meet or exceed the design goals described below.   •	Areas of expected improvement over current air-ground communications systems for ATS. •	Scalability of the system to meet increasing demands and the system’s ultimate total capacity. •	A description of the impact (high-level transition plan, schedule and relative cost) on current airborne and ground avionics and infrastructure.  •	Technical maturity of the system solution, including status of applicable standards, commercial availability of electronics, and estimates of time for infusion into the National Airspace System. The following high-level functional design goals for a mobile air-ground communications system to be used in providing ATS are intended to provide insight into the performance of the current system, and desired characteristics of a future system:	 •	Increase the channel capacity of the current air-ground communications system. •	Utilize the VHF aeronautical communications frequency band, or justify the utilization of other aeronautical frequency allocations.  •	Provide for an orderly and efficient transition from the current VHF communications system. •	Provide a mechanism for “real-time” voice, with requisite combined performance in latency and channel access that promotes efficient and effective communications between a controller and the set of aircraft within the controlled airspace. •	Provide a mechanism for both addressable and broadcast data functions. •	Provide a mechanism to specify various Quality of Service (QoS) classes for data transfer. •	Within each QoS class, provide a mechanism for scheduling and prioritizing data delivery. •	Include configurable security measures to provide user authentication features. •	Provide a mechanism to control multiple sectors in the same geographic area. •	Provide aircraft position location capability.

<SUBJECT>D -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a small business set-aside, sole-source, firm-fixed price purchase order to MS Technologies Corporation (MST), to provide hardware and software upgrades to the Office of Personnel Management, Center for Retirement and Insurance Service's current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System.
 
Description:  The contractor will be required to incorporate updates to bring the system in line with the latest technologies and therefore, improve the overall database/IVR system performance.  It will also reinforce network stability and protection against virus attacks.  There is a 90 day warranty period for the upgraded components.  This purchase order will be award August 11, 2004.  The work will be performed at the Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC  20415.  The purchase order will be effective for a period of 8 weeks.  The implementation is scheduled to begin on August 16, 2004.  The completion date is scheduled for September 30, 2004.  

The total upgrade will include the following hardware and software packages include the following information: 1) 3 -MST IVR hardware upgrade from WinNT to W2K (VC-IVR-UP); 2) 2 -  MST IVR  Application Conversion; 3) 1- MST QVQ Application Conversion/CTI Interface; 4) 1- MST TDD Application Conversion; 5)3 - OPM Transcription Service and all upload/download Utilities; 6) 3 - IVR Application Server Installation and Configuration (VC-IVR-INST); 7) 1- MST Database Server Hardware Upgrade (MST-DB-SVR-UP) and 8) 1- Database Installation and Configuration/Transcription Storage Allocation (MST-DB-SVR-INST-VC-IVR-INST).

MS Technologies built the original IVR platform and wrote the codes to develop the database for the IVR.  The IVR system is compatible with the existing analog and digital telephone equipment and is fully expandable to support a variety of voice processing functions. 

To award this contract to another contractor will void the current maintenance agreement on the system, and require OPM to purchase another telephone system which will be a considerable cost to the government and its customers. MS Technologies is the only know licensed dealer that’s authorized to sell, distribute and maintain the IVR System.  It would be inefficient to issue a new contract to another firm because they would have to repeat the work that has been performed by MS Technologies and gain knowledge of the operations of the IVR System	

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are invited to submit in writing, within 15 days of publication of this notice, complete information describing their ability to provide these services.  Such information should contain pricing information for providing these services.  The Government will not pay for information provided.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  Interested vendors are requested to contact the OPM Contracting Officer, Toni Campbell at Antoinette.Campbell@opm.gov or by fax 202 606-0910.

Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked.  Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (or The Government) determines disclosure is warranted by FOIA.  However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.

<SUBJECT>84 -- FPI's T-Shirt Production in FY 2003
<DESC>The Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) Industries Reform Act of 1988 established the Industry Involvement Guidelines which, in part, provide procedures that FPI will follow prior to initiating production of a new product or significant expansions of an existing product.  During the recent preparation of the annual Sales Report, FPI management staff noted that t-shirt production was over the Board of Directors approved units for FY 2003.   

FPI has produced t-shirts at its facility at FCI Jesup since the 1980s.  In 1995, FPI began screen printing t-shirts for the Air Force at FCI Jesup.  FPI received the t-shirts from a private vendor, screen printed them, and forwarded the t-shirts to the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) for the Air Force.  In FY 2003, FPI was informed that the vendor that made the fabric and cut the t-shirts were sending the cut pieces to Mexico to be sewn.  DoD advised FPI to discontinue the purchase of the t-shirts produced outside of the U.S.  In an effort to comply with DSCP’s request, FPI subsequently began to make the t-shirts in-house with domestically purchased fabric, as it does for other PFU t-shirts it produces for DSCP.  This action resulted in FPI inadvertently exceeding its Board approved production level in FY 2003 for t-shirts by 230,000 units.  The Board approved sales level was not exceeded.  FPI has therefore requested retroactive approval from the Board of this overage in unit production of t-shirts in FY 2003.  

This notice solicits comments from interested parties concerning any impact related to FPI’s failure to go through the guidelines process during the time period in question.  Comments on this notice are due within 30 days of the date of publication in the FedBizOpps.  All comments received will be forwarded to FPI’s Board of Directors for consideration as the Board evaluates FPI’s request for ratification of the production of t-shirts.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC>Internet & Computer Training Labs – Baghdad Courts:  

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0  Background

     1.1. The Iraqi Judicial System was poorly resourced be the former regime and suffered significant infrastructure damage during the war.  Efforts by the Iraqi Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Justice Advisory Team, the US Armed Forces and others have been successful in repairing much of the damage to the Iraqi judicial infrastructure, vetting the judges and key personnel and modernizing aspects of the Iraqi Legal Codes.  A review of the systems of the courts used by the various Baghdad courts by the 1st Cavalry Division revealed that the courts did not have adequately developed systems to effectively manage their dockets and coordination with other agencies.  In a series of meetings with court personnel throughout Baghdad including the lower courts and the appellate courts, the need for immediate improvements to the capabilities of the court personnel to use computers and to communicate electronic data over the internet was established.  These upgrades have been requested by Iraqi judicial personnel located throughout the city.

     1.2. Development of computer literacy and access coupled with internet connectivity is a major step toward the long term goal of the development of a system wide court administration upgrade as it will set the conditions for the use of modern technologies to manage the dockets and business of the courts. These system upgrades are necessary to bring transparency and greater accountability to the Baghdad Courts. 

     1.3. In order to ensure that the courts are properly trained in computers and digital databases, and file sharing that will be required in the future, this statement of work will govern four broad areas:  1) the acquisition and installation of fully licensed MS Office (Arabic) and operating systems and an evaluation of the computers currently in the possession of the MOJ Advisory Team for suitability of the project.  This will require an evaluation of the hardware to include whether Arabic keyboards are required and whether the computers can be used at all for the intended purpose; 2) installation of satellite based internet connectivity with required drops for the computers installed at the courts; 3) initial training offered at the courts with the installed systems for judges and personnel for 4 days with 4 hours of on- site follow-up training offered every week for 52 weeks after installation; 4) maintenance and troubleshooting of the machines and software for 52 weeks after installation

This comparison will consider age and usage of the equipment, warranty terms, total price, etc. 4)	Identify the most advantageous quotation containing other than new items 5)	Compare the otherwise successful quotation containing only new items to the most advantageous quotation containing other than new items through risk and value analysis.  The salient comparison will be this: Is the price savings for procuring other than new items worth the extra risk to the Government?  If the answer is determined to be "no", award will be made to the otherwise successful quotation containing only new items; if "yes", award will be made to the most advantageous quotation containing other than new items. Please note that the Government cannot accept quotations including other than new software products, for security reasons.

NIST requires a vacuum system capable of co-sputtering from two sputtering guns simultaneously. Additionally, NIST requires that the system be equipped with an ion-mill for surface cleaning, and a sample load-lock. The load-lock must also be configured to allow controlled oxygen dosing of the wafers between deposition steps.
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.  The solicitation number is RA1341-04-RP-4033 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.

All equipment, excluding the rough vacuum pump shall be Class 100 clean-room compatible, designed to sit entirely within the cleanroom. All clean-room equipment shall be housed entirely within a 1.2 meter by 2.2 meter (4 by 7 foot) footprint, including hook-ups to house facilities, such as gas line connections and vacuum lines, which will pass through the wall of the cleanroom. The system shall utilize single point connections for any necessary house facilities (such as chilled water, compressed air, vent gas, process gas). The system shall have an internal electrical distribution and require only a single connection to a 208 V 3 phase 100 amp connection.
The system shall meet OSHA standards for operator safety and SEMI standards for environmental safety.
The system shall be equipped with an easily accessible emergency, red in color, mushroom-button shut-off switch which when activated safely turns off any ongoing process without causing damage to a sample in process during the shut-down procedure.

6.	Ion Source
The system shall be equipped with an ion source for cleaning the substrates by ion milling with Ar ions. The ion source shall be capable of delivering a beam of at 0.10 mA/cm^2 at an ion energy of 400 V and be able to provide a maximum ion energy of at least 1000 volts. The ion source shall be at least 3 cm in diameter with defocusing ion optics. It is preferable that the ion source be of a Veeco model 03DC-PKG-ASSY Kaufman type source although other sources are possible. The ion source shall either be mounted in a confocal position (like the sputter guns) or along the central axis of substrate rotation, with the central axis position being preferred. The ion source shall have adequate shielding to prevent contamination from the sputter sources. The ion source shall include an appropriate power supply.
7.	Substrate Handling 
The deposition system shall be able to pump, load, and deposit on 75 mm (SEMI-standard 3 inch wafer) with less than a 2 mm edge exclusion region. The system shall be upgradeable to 100 mm wafers without replacement of major components such as load-lock, gate valves etc. It is preferred that the system can pump, load, and deposit on any substrate from odd-shaped pieces up to 150 mm wafers with only minor system modification.
The system shall be able to transfer the substrates from the load-lock to the deposition chamber in a simple and efficient manner. The substrate holder shall be rotatable, and equipped with a motor capable of rotating the substrates at a speed of at least 30 rpm. The substrate holder shall be designed such that the wafer temperature will not exceed 130C after 5 minutes of sputtering at conditions that obtain a deposition rate of 1.5 nm/sec for Al. This may be accomplished by active cooling of the substrate holder, or by use of a substrate holder of sufficient heat capacity. It is preferred that the substrate holder be retrofittable for both rf-biasing or heating to temperatures of at least 500 C.
8.	Process gas handling
The system shall provide means to provide process gas to the sputter sources. There shall be at least two process gas inputs. Each process gas channel shall consist of a pneumatically or electrically controlled shutoff valve and a mass-flow controller. The system shall provide electronic means for controlling the mixture of the both the input gas mixture and the system process pressure. Either upstream (flow control) or downstream (conductance control) is acceptable. The system must provide adequate flows and pumping conductance to allow operation over a pressure range from less than 2 mTorr to greater than 20 mTorr during sputter operation.
9.	Controls, Instrumentation and Automation

SUBJECT:  Site Visit Minutes, FQ442641620100,  Install/Remove Carpet B1600

Attendees:

Lt Terry Whited, Contracting Officer	256-9289
TSgt Crystal Amos, Contract Specialist	256-9309               	
Ms. Cicely Hudson, Solutions

Mr. Tom Stanely, Sonag Inc

    I.  OLD BUSINESS
1. A site visit was held on 21 Jul 04 at 1000 at building 1600.  Two vendors were present.  TSgt Amos gave a brief overview of the project.  Contractors are to raise the systems furniture and remove and install carpet in the areas specified.  As stated in the SOW the work would be done at night between the hours of 1600 and 2400.  No work permitted on the weekends.  Mr. Hall the end user, will provide temporary passes for the crew.  Security Forces personnel will be escorts for the crew.  TSgt Amos instructed the individuals that any questions they have would need to be sent in writing by Tuesday 27 Jul 04.  She would accept e-mailed or faxed questions.  
      
2. Mr. Hill walked the individuals through the areas and indicated the areas where
work will be performed.  A vendor tested a piece of carpet and found that it was 
a quick release.  Mr. Hill stated the Government will deliver the carpet in small quantities to for convenience.  The contractor has to communicate how much work can be done in 8 hour periods.  There will be a storage area in the building for the carpet.

3. A vendor asked about the flexibilty in the communication lines in regard to lifting the systems furniture.  They were concerned that the lines are taunt and would be damaged.  Mr. Hill stated that the communication lines come from the ceiling and not the floor so there would be no problem but he would double check the location of all the lines.

4. Mr. Hill stated he would have to check and find out if the Commander’s corridor is included in the work. The vendors asked if there were any drawings to scale available for this project?  Mr. Hill said that they would check with CE.  TSgt Amos would check too.  The small drawing provided at the visit would be scanned and uploaded so everyone would have access to it.

5. A vendor stated that the project performance period of 60 days was too short with the amount of furniture that had to be moved during the short hours.  He would address this in his questions.

6. A vendor asked if a second site visit could be scheduled so his systems furniture subs could view the site and provide an estimate.  He said that he could not determine the amount of furniture to be moved in the package he received.  TSgt Amos asked the vendor to put his request in writing and said that she would look into the possiblity of another site visit.

This concluded the site visit.

<DESC>Response to Questions (Set 1 of 2) - It is anticipated Set 2 will be released tomorrow. Question 1.) Does the SEC want real-time reports of Web site performance, alerts when service performance in degrading or interrupted, and diagnostic information that allows for quick remedial action? The request is for web page content to identify areas on the sites that are the heaviest utilized and allow us to capability to track this and re-design the page to better serve the end users. We already have procedures/equipment in place to monitor the infrastructure for bottle necks, etc. 2.) What Web monitoring tools are currently being used? We don’t currently have one. 3.) Will the SEC consider an off-site hosted service to fulfill any of the requirements? No, we need the capability to monitor our sites internally. 4.) What are the versions of the software (i.e. Sybase, Tomcat, etc.) used in the production system? Sybase 12.X and Tomcat 4.01.X. 5.) C.A2.2 SEC Policy and Procedures. The tool shall comply with the SEC Section 508 Policy located at http://wapps.sec.gov/oit/oit_docs/Section508Policy.doc. This information is not open via public access. Would the SEC provide a working link so the requirement can be reviewed? No, the requirement is found in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

QUESTION - What is the background of students attending both the management/staff course and the information management course? What technical experience do they have and what is their comfort level with technology in general? 
ABSWER - All personnel attending the management/staff course will be in the IT field or associated with IT.  However, their comfort level and practical experience will vary widely from just having a conceptual grasp to daily practical application.  Therefore, practical exercises need to provide sufficient detail to accommodate those people who do not use the technology daily.

QUESTION - What software/hardware would be on the government-provided students’ laptops? 
ANSWER - Government provided laptops can only be assumed to have the basic operating system consisting of Windows 2000 Pro or Windows XP with Remote Desktop installed.  The hardware can only be assumed to be a Pentium 3, 600mhz, with 256mb RAM and a RJ-45 network interface card.  Disk space on the laptops cannot be assumed to be available for installing applications. Vendors typically provide a preconfigured training environment by providing all software necessary for training in a virtual desktop accessible through Remote Desktop to support the training requirements.

QUESTION - Do you have any preferred facilities that you like us to use for these classes? We do not have a local training facility in Fort Bragg and will arrange to rent one. But we were wondering if there a specific facility that you think would work better for you? 
ANSWER - Any facility within a 15 mile commuting radius of Hqs, USASOC, that will provide adequate space, power, climate control, and instructional support for a 20 person class should be satisfactory.  Typically local hotels have conference rooms that can meet the standards for a training environment.  The vendor is expected to provide all networking infrastructure to support the training environment.*****
