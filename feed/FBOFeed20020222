<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, intends to solicit and award a Firm-Fixed Price Service Purchase Order to Ayers Associates pursuant to the Authority of 10 U.S.C 2304© (1) only one responsible Source under Federal Acquisition Regulatio ns FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to formulate design concepts for five (5) tributary outlets for Reach 6 of the Sims Bayou Project (downstream of Cullen to SH288).  Award is sole source because Ayers Associates recently completed sim ilar work in Reach 5 for a Value Engineering (VE) Proposal that was accepted by the Galveston District.  Ayers developed a unique design concept and associated tools for design of Articulated Concrete Block (ACB) lining for the VE Proposal.   Galveston Dis trict wishes to consider similar concepts for Reach 6 and will benefit from the previous Ayers groundwork by directing the following-up design and analysis to that firm.  The scope of work includes providing a design report that compares the safety, costs,  reliability, aesthetics, and flexibility of tributary outlet concepts and recommends as preferred concept to be used for the five tributary outlets in Reach 6.  Firms that have specialized expertise in ACB design and have performed full-scale laboratory t esting of ACB systems should respond to this announcement.  Firms should provide proof these designs have been field tested, for flood channelization projects similar to the Sims Bayou Flood Control Project, Harris County, Houston, Texas.  Two (2) copies o f the response shall be mailed to the attention of Mr. Curtis Cole, Jr., at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, P.O. Box 1229, Galveston, Texas, 77553-1229.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort by e-mail, fax or by mail only to Ms. Terry Cobb, NASA/LaRC, M/S 126, Hampton, VA 23681;the fax number is 757-864-6966 not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on March 11, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This invention is a significant improvement to existing hydrothermal methods for producing nano-crystalline metal oxide, metal oxysulfate, and metal oxyphosphate particles. The method employs a rapid, continuous flow of a homogeneous aqueous precursor solution through a heated reaction tube at elevated pressures. The chemical reactions which occur in the tube cause particle precipitation, nucleation, and crystallization. The particle-fluid mixture then flows through a nozzle and into a cooled, low-pressure region which allows for nearly instantaneous termination of particle growth and for product recovery. The relatively short residence time (seconds to a few minutes) of the solution in the reaction tube assures a high production rate of very fine, high surface area, nano-crystalline particles suspended in an aqueous medium which can be used for polishing applications or for applying a catalytically active coating to a support. Dry nano-crystalline powders suited for a variety of industrial applications can also be prepared (e.g., spray drying) from the aqueous suspensions.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

The rooftop space is available in 25 square foot blocks, with a single block able to accommodate a single whip or panel antenna.

The duration of the base period will be 12-months with four (4) twelve-month option year periods. Contract magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The guaranteed minimum amount for the life of the contract (base plus 4 option years) is $100,000 and the maximum amount for the life of the contract is estimated at $5,000,000.

Date for receipt of proposals:  Friday, April 26, 2002

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals to develop and deliver a training course entitled ?Quality Assurance and Quality Control in Transit Projects.?

The proposed course will provide an overview of the essential elements of quality assurance and quality control in transit projects and address the inter-relationships and balances among the quality, costs, and schedules.  This course is intended to review and expand upon the Federal Transit Administration?s (FTA) February 2002 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Guidelines.  It will also address the various perspectives for quality from an owner, consultant, contractor, vendor, and user points of view.

The FTA spends about $25 million per year to finance the Project Management Oversight (PMO) Program which is to protect the federal investment and ensure the standards of quality on FTA-funded projects such as design and construction, procurement, testing, software development, and communication systems. This training course will compliment the work undertaken by the PMO Program and will be the first stand-alone course in quality offered by NTI to the transit industry.

The course will be offered to current and new transit professionals that engage in federally funded activities.  The course will be particularly beneficial for grantees, FTA staff, consultants, contractors, and vendors.

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted. Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFPs will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by March 21, 2002.  RFPs will be mailed out shortly thereafter. Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small businesses, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned business.  These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates rates and service of electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives, including the SEC.  The commission has issued Certificates of Public Con venience and Necessity to SEC, and only to SEC, to provide electric utility service in Socorro County, New Mexico.  SEC has the transmission infrastructure to provide electric utility services to multiple service points located in Socorro County on White S ands Missile Range.  Nearly all the transmission infrastructure on White Sands in Socorro County belongs to SEC.  The Government-owned powerlines are remote; the projected use of electricity across the Government-owned powerlines is small and will not incr ease significantly.  Therefore SEC is the only organization capable of providing, and permitted to provide the required utility services.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends negotiate with only one source under th e authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate using open market procedures to procure programming support for ARAMS Web update for Military Sealift Command.  The contractor shall provide in part 1.0 REQUIREMENT      	1.1 The contractor shall provide Web Objects programming support to update the ARAMS WEB application hosted at the MSC ARAMS warehouse Chesapeake, VA. The application was developed using WEB OBJECTS 4.5 and uses a Sybase ASA 7.x database. The application supports multiple warehouses. The contractor shall update the application at MSCHQ (Washington, DC) and MSC ARAMS Warehouse  (Chesapeake, VA) and provide source code and documentation of changes to MSCHQ, Bill Merkle in accordance with the deliverables format.  These warehouses provide used parts to MSC ships.  The application can be viewed at http://164.231.46.15/ 2.0  TASKING 2.1  The contractor shall provide WEB O BJECTS programming, testing and installation services to update the existing ARAMS Web Code. 2.2  The conctractor shall fix Transaction Report.  The dba assigned to this project is Jason Jardine from SYSBASE, (202) 685-5623. See Enclosure (2.1) of SOW. 2.2.3  End Value (24) = Begin Value (3) + ((Receipts (17) + Haystack (Gain) (21) + Merges (Gain) (22)) – (Issues (18) + Losses (19) + Surveys (28) + Turn-ins (20) + Haystack (Loss) (21) + Merges (Loss) (22)))  for any transaction period 2.2.4  End Line Item Count (25) = Begin Line Item Count (4) + (Receipts (11) – (Issues (12) + Losses (13) + Surveys (27) + Turn-ins (14) + Merges (16))) for any transaction period. 2.3  The contractor shall change 1348-1A  format.  See enclosure (2.3) of SOW.   2.4  The contractor shall add the Special Material Identification Code (SMIC) field to the Stock Record Card (SCR).  See enclosure (2 .4) of SOW.  SMIC is a two-digit alpha or numeric weapon system code.  This code identifies the end item for which a requirement has been submitted.  2.5  The contractor shall add Date validated, SMIC, and COG to the advanced search.  See enclosure (2.5) of SOW. 2.6  The contractor shall allow batch printing of 1348-1A for turn-ins.  2.7  The contractorshall change the import routine to search under National Item Identification Number (NIIN).  The current import routine looks at NSN (NSN = Federal Supply Class (FSC)  + NIIN). Ignore the FSC of the NSN (the first 4-digits) and search using the 9-digit NIIN. The  last 9 positions (00-123-4567) are the National Item Identification Number (NIIN) and identify the specific item.  The part / cage search capability should be retained.  2.8  The contractor shall add the capability to change unit of issues without generating losse s or gains.  I.e., If you have 12 parts with the unit of issue of each (ea) and the unit of issue is changed to dozen (dz), the current system creates a loss for the 11 parts.  The system should change the unit of issue, the quantity and the price without generating a loss.  I.e., If you have 12 (ea) parts at $1.00 each and based on a Haystack or manual validation you change it to 1 (dz) at $24.00.  You should not gain or lose any items.  The price different would be reflected on the transaction report under Haystack.  2.9  The contractor shall standup the software on a test site for MSC users acceptance testing. 2.10	The contractor shall correct any problems noted during acceptance testing or as problems arise. 2.11  The contractor shall update code at MSCHQ and MSC Chesapeake. 3.0	SOFTWARE DELIVERABLE FORMAT 3.1  MEDIA All software will be delivered either via diske tte or compact disk.  Software will not be accepted via e-mail.  This includes any changes to software resulting from Independent Verification and Validation (IV & V) testing. 3.2	DETAILED DELIVERY FORMAT The deliverable will be composed of two main directories, the existing productions environment and the current release being delivered.  The directories will be named with the appropriate version and application name abbreviation (e.g. TMS V1.0, TMS V1.01). The first main directory will consist of a number of sub-directories representing the major components of the application's production environment (e.g., dlls, scripts, reports, executable, source code, documentation, etc.)  The number of sub-directories will obviously vary from application to application.  The naming convention for each directory will be left up to the discretion of the developer and must remain c onsistent from release to release. The second main directory will consist of only those sub-directories having changes.  For example; if a  maintenance release only consists of adding a few dlls, the only sub-directories would be a dll sub-directory and its contents would only be those added dlls.  If a functional  change required a new documentation and a resulting new user manual, the documentations sub-directory would only include the new user manual.  On the subsequent release, the above examples would be rolled into the production environment directory. If during IV & V testing it becomes necessary to make changes, the above format will still be required.  During the IV & V testing period all changes will be rolled into the original deliverable with each subsequent IV & V deliverable reflecting all previous changes.  The result is each IV & V deliverable being abl e to stand on its own as a final deliverable.  Absolutely no deliverables containing only partial changes will be accepted. 3.3  DELIVERY LETTER A delivery letter will accompany all deliverables.  This document will be required in addition to any other MSC specified documentation.  The letter will provide: ·	A detailed description of what is being delivered to include a complete list of files in each sub-directory. ·	What type of change (new functionality, fix a problem, etc.). ·	Detailed instructions for installation (e.g., the order of scripts requiring to be run). ·	A point of contact with phone number of the developer. 4.0  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE ARAMS EAST COAST, Chesapeake, VA. MSCHQ, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. 5.0  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE One year from date of award 6.0  FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/MATERIAL/SERVICE  ARAMS Web Source Code as  of  11/02/2001  (MSC will FTP as required) 7.0  SECURITY None ****

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

"B" - All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified below for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer an Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Major Chris Harrington, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  "F" - This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017- 3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

The course will cover an in-depth exploration of BRT to include but not be limited to: its elements, current applications, how it impacts and is impacted by other modes, its role in land use planning and community development, and a cost benefit comparison with other modes. The course will consist of one and one-half days (16 hours) of actual instruction.  The first two hours (2) of the course will be designed as an executive overview and summary of BRT suitable for presentation in a stand-alone format.  This course is aimed at two distinct audiences.  The first two hours will be designed to attract a broad audience of decision-makers drawn primarily from outside the transit industry.  The audience for the full course will consist of transportation professionals drawn from planners, engineers and operating personnel from transit as well as the other modes. The contract will require the development of a participant manual, instructor?s guides, and presentation aids for the delivery of the one and one half day course.  The BRT course will be offered up to eight (8) times a year during the five-year contract period. NTI will require proposers to have experience in the subject of Bus Rapid Transit as well as experience in developing and delivering related training courses for transportation professionals.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, White Sands Contracting Division, Building 126W Crozier Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico 88002-5201, intends to award a follow-on contract for Electric Utility Service, including the provision of  electrical power and maintenance of Government powerlines, to multiple service points located in Otero and Lincoln Counties on White Sands Missile Range.  The follow-on contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to Otero County Electric Cooperative ( OCEC) in accordance with 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 41.201(d)(1), Section 8093 of the Department of Defense Appropr iations Act of 1988, Pub.L.100-202, provides that none of the funds appropriated by that Act or any other Act with respect to any fiscal year by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, may be used for the purchase of electricity by  the Government in any manner that is inconsistent with state law governing the providing of electric utility service, including state utility commission rulings and electric utility franchises or service territories established pursuant to state statute, state regulation, or state-approved territorial agreements.  The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates rates and service of electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives, including the OCEC.  The commission has issued Certificates of Publi c Convenience and Necessity to OCEC, and only to OCEC, to provide electric utility service in Otero and Lincoln Counties, New Mexico.  OCEC has the transmission infrastructure to provide electric utility services to multiple service points located in Otero  and Lincoln Counties County on White Sands Missile Range.  Nearly all the transmission infrastructure on White Sands in Otero and Lincoln Counties County belongs to OCEC.  The Government-owned powerlines are remote; the projected use of electricity across  the Government-owned powerlines is small and will not increase significantly.  Therefore OCEC is the only organization capable of and permitted to provide the required utility services.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Governmen t intends negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

Paint shall be homogenous, easily stirred to smooth consistency, and shall show no objectionable characteristics due to prolonged storage.  The composition and quality of the paint shall be such as to produce a strong and adherent binder for the reflective media, form a firm bond with the pavement on which applied, and have sufficient resistance to weathering and traffic.

a.	Pigmented Binder:  Pigmented binder (paint) covered by Federal Specification TT-P-1952D shall be used for reflective and non-reflective markings

b.	Reflective Media:  Reflective spheres with a reflective index of not less than 1.5, as covered in Federal Specification TT-B-1325C, Type I, 1.5 Index of Refraction:  Gradation A (Course Drop-on) shall be used for reflective markings.

15.  RATE OF APPLICATION:  Pigmented Binder, referred to in paragraph 14 above, shall be applied at a rate of 1 gallon spread evenly over existing painted pavement area of 120, ? 5 square feet for both reflective and non-reflective markings.  This is equivalent to 12 to 14 mils wet thickness or 7 to 8 mils dry thickness.

Reflective Media: Reflective glass spheres shall be applied uniformly to wet paint on roads and streets at a rate of 6 pounds of glass spheres for each gallon of paint. The maximum acceptable tolerable level for both types of pavement shall be ? .5 points of glass spheres per gallon of paint.

16.  EQUIPMENT:

a.	Paint Applicator: The equipment for applying the paint is to be self propelled or mobile drawn pneumatic spraying machine with an arrangement of atomizing nozzles capable of applying in a single pass, a line 4 inches to 6 inches in width. The applicator is to be capable of applying the line at a speed of not less 4 miles per hour.  The machine is to be capable of applying the paint at the rates specified in paragraph 14 at an even and uniform thickness, with clear-cut edges.  The paint applicator is to have a paint reservoir or tank of sufficient capacity to apply paint as prescribed by the requirements of this specification.  The spray mechanism will be operated by means of quick opening and closing valves conveniently located and will include the necessary pressure regulators and gauges in full view and reach of the operator at all times.  The paint applicator will be readily adaptable for attachment of an air-actuated dispenser for the reflective media.  Paint strainers will be installed in the paint supply lines to ensure freedom from residue and foreign matter that may cause malfunction of the spray guns.

b.	Reflective Media dispenser: The dispenser for drop in of reflective media will be attached to the paint dispenser and operated automatically and simultaneously with the paint applicator through the same control mechanism.  The dispenser will be designed to provide uniform flow of reflective media at the established rate of coverage, as indicated in paragraph 15 above, regardless of the speed of the paint applicator to which it is attached.  The dispenser should be timed with a delay shut off after the paint such that a full application rate of reflective media is applied all the way to the edge of the painted area.

c.	Paint Removal.  The equipment used in the removal process shall be mounted on pneumatic tires and shall remove deposits of paint without causing damage to pavement surfaces, joints, or joint and crack seal material.

17.  WEATHER LIMITATIONS:  The paint and reflective media, or the paint alone shall not be applied to damp or wet pavement surfaces, or when inclement weather threatens to interrupt normal progress of work.  Paint shall not be applied when the ambient temperature is below 50 ?F or exceeds 95 ?F, when the relative humidity exceeds 90 percent nor when the wind velocity exceeds 15 miles per hour.

18.	SURFACE PREPERATION:  
a. 	Paint Removal.  The Contractor is required to remove 85 percent of the paint buildup from designated areas of roadway pavement.  Paint shall be removed by high-pressure water and/or grinding.  The Contractor may inject sand as an abrasive into the high-pressure water system.  The use of environmentally acceptable chemical agents or high velocity impact removal shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Use of any chemicals or impact abrasive in the removal process must be approved in advance by the CO.  The Government specifically reserves the right to reject the use of any paint removal process which the CO determines may pose unnecessary risks to human health, or the environment, as a result of its use, storage, or disposal. 

b. 	Test Strip Demonstration.  The Contractor shall test all equipment and demonstrate on the designated pavement work areas the proposed method to be used to remove paint.  The Contracting Officer (CO) will designate a test strip within the work area.  The test strip shall be as wide as the full operating width of the equipment and long enough to determine the operating parameters of the vehicle(s) and equipment to be used for the work.  The test strip shall be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Contractor?s methods and equipment to satisfactorily remove paint deposits from the pavement surfaces at the specified removal rate without damaging the pavement surface. The CO and/or CO?s representative(s) shall be present at the test area to examine the pavement texture obtained on the test strip.  The test strip shall be the measure of performance required of the Contractor for the paint removal project.  The Contractor shall not proceed with the work until the results of the test strip are satisfactory to the CO or authorized representative.

c. 	Pavement Damage Repair.  Any damage to the pavement surface, joints, joint and crack seals, or other Government property incurred during the performance of the work shall be repaired by the Contractor at the Contractor?s expense.  Repair methods and materials shall be approved by the CO prior to performance of the repairs.  Repairs shall be completed within the performance period for the contract.

d. 	All surfaces to be marked shall be thoroughly cleaned immediately prior to application of the paint.  Dust, clay, silt, and other granular surface deposits shall be removed by sweeping, blowing with compressed air, rinsing with water, or a combination of these methods, as required

19.  APPLICATION OF PAINT AND REFLECTIVE MEDIA:

a.	After the surfaces to be painted have been prepared in accordance with paragraph 18 above, the paint binder shall be applied at a rate of coverage specified in paragraph 15 above.  The width of the lines should match the existing in place.  Workmanship shall conform to the best commercial practices consistent with these specifications.  Completed work, as well as work in progress, is subject to the Contracting Officer or designated representatives approval in all respects.  Areas not properly painted shall be repaired at no additional cost to the government.  Any spilled paint shall be cleaned from the paved areas to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer or designated representative and this clean up must meet all requirements in paragraphs 6 and 9 above. The contractor shall keep the premises clean at all times. Paint, empty containers, and other material or equipment shall not be stored or allowed to accumulate on or near the paved areas.

b.	Reflective Media: Drop in application of the glass spheres shall be accomplished in such a manner to ensure that the reflective media is evenly distributed at the specified rate of coverage.  Application of the reflective media shall immediately follow the application of the paint binder.  Should there be a malfunction of either the paint applicator or the reflective media dispenser, operations shall be immediately discontinued until the discrepancy is corrected.  The area painted during malfunction of the equipment shall be corrected at no additional cost to the government.

20. PROTECTION OF WORK:  Newly painted surfaces shall be protected from damage by vehicles during the time required for paint to harden sufficiently to withstand traffic. Contractor shall provide and place traffic cones along the vehicle drive lanes and centerline to alert or divert vehicle traffic in order to protect painted surfaces until paint dries.  During periods of high wind, 15 miles per hour or greater, painting shall be discontinued.  Any damage to newly painted markings because of contractor?s failure to provide adequate protection, shall be repaired by him at no additional cost.

21.  JOB SITE VERIFICATION:  The dimensions and quantities that follow are provided to the contractor for approximation purposes only.  Failure to field verify the dimensions and quantities will be at the Contractors risk and shall not relieve the Contractor from accomplishing the work required by the contract at the price awarded by the government.  The approximate amount of existing paint to be removed is 2,500 liner feet.  The approximate amount of white solid line is 32,300 linear feet. The approximate amount of white dashed lines is 16,500 linear feet of road distance.  The approximate amount of yellow solid line is 31,850 linear feet.

<SUBJECT>A--Deep Trek Program Solicitation
<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-02NT41434
<CONTACT>Raymond Jarr, Contracting Officer, Contact Contract Specialist, RJARR@NETL.DOE.GOV;Kelly McDonald, Contract Specialist, 304-285-4113, kelly.mcdonald@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>Notice is hereby given of the intent to issue Financial Assistance Solicitation No. DE-PS26-02NT41434 entitled "Deep Trek Program Solicitation."  The general goal of this research and development effort is to support development of new and/or innovative technologies that are required to meet the needs of the U.S. natural gas industry in gaining improved access to natural gas resources at depths beyond 20,000 feet.  The "Deep Trek Program Solicitation" supports the DOE/NETL's Strategic Center for Natural Gas' 2020 Vision of increased benefits to the U.S. public from an affordable supply, reliable delivery, and increased environmental protection from an increase in natural gas usage.  Industry input on the solicitation objectives was obtained during a workshop in Houston, Texas on March 20 - 21, 2001.  The objective of this solicitation is to increase the overall effective rate-of-penetration (ROP) for deep drilling, including technologies such as "Smart"systems and materials for the hostile environment normally found at depths beyond 20,000 feet. Comments and/or questions should be transmitted through the "Submit Questions" feature. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: It is anticipated that this action will consist of a single solicitation with multiple closing dates.  It is also anticipated that a pre-application process will be used.  After consideration of the technical discussion of the pre-application, each applicant will be notified as to whether the applicant can submit a subsequent comprehensive application. The program solicitation will focus on the following two specific topic areas: 1. Improved economics in deep well drilling, including, but not limited to: (1)  Innovative drilling hardware concepts to improve rate-of-penetration (ROP) in deep hostile environments, with a focus on material science, electronics, software development and advanced drilling fluid technology  advancements; and, (2) Improvements in diagnostic capability during drilling operations. 2. Improved economics in deep well completions, including, but not limited to: Drilling and completion fluid optimization for deep wells. It is anticipated that the work performed under this action will consist of three (3) phases similar to the following: Phase I - Feasibility Concept Definition; Phase II - Prototype Development or Research, Development, and Testing; Phase III - Field/System Demonstration and Commercialization. The maximum period of performance for all three (3) phases is estimated at forty-eight (48) months.  The goal of this procurement is to work toward a demonstration of concepts at a commercially scalable size.  It is recognized that each applicant may propose varying scopes of effort for one or more of the three (3) phases, and consequently, an applicant is not required to perform all Phase I activities if significant work on Phase I type activities has been previously completed.  If the applicant proposed to initially proceed to Phase II or III efforts, information must be included in their application which demonstrates the merit of the previous research and reference to the results. For successful applicants proposing to Phase II or III, the cost of work performed by the applicant to satisfy the Phase I or II requirements prior to the execution of the resulting agreement will not be considered when calculating cost share.  Due to the nature and objective of this solicitation, it is anticipated that a mixture of applications will be accepted with staggered beginning dates, and it is therefore anticipated that any applicant selected for award shall proceed on it's own schedule, independent of any other application.  The schedule will be based on the best estimate of the time it will take the team to complete the three (3)-phase effort and address the solicitation objective. DOE anticipates multiple cooperative agreement awards under each topic area resulting from this solicitation, and no fee or profit will be paid to a Recipient or Subrecipient under the awards.  This particular program is covered by Section 3001 and 3002 of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), 42 U.S.C. 13542. EPAct 3002 requires a cost-share commitment of at least 20 percent from non-Federal sources for research and development projects and at least 50 percent for demonstration and commercial projects.  Depending on the phase and maturation stage of the agreement, cost-share expectations will range from 20 to 50 percent.  This particular program is also covered by Section 2306 of EPAct, 42 U.S.C. 13525.  In order for a company to be eligible for an award under this solicitation, the company's participation must be in the economic interest of the U.S. and the company must either be a U.S.-owned company or incorporated in the U.S. with its parent company incorporated in a country that (i) affords to U.S.-owned companies opportunities, comparable to those afforded to any other company, to participate in any joint venture similar to those authorized under the Act; (ii) affords to U.S-owned companies local investment opportunities comparable to those afforded to any other company; and (iii) affords adequate and effective protection for the intellectual property rights of U.S.-owned companies.  This eligibility requirement also applies to all companies participating in any joint venture, "team" arrangement, or as a major subcontractor.  The solicitation will contain as part of the application package the applicable EPAct representation form(s).  In addition to EPAct, applicant's must incur at least 75 percent of the direct labor cost for the project (including subcontractor labor) in the U.S..  At current planning levels, and subject to the availability of funds, DOE expects to provide up to approximately $3,400,000 to support work under this solicitation. Applications which include performance of Federal agencies and agents (i.e. Management and Operations (M&O) contractors and/or National Laboratories) as a team member will be acceptable under this solicitation if the proposed use of any such entities is specifically authorized by the executive Federal agency managing the M&O or National Laboratory, and the work is not otherwise available from the private sector.  Such work, if approved, would be accomplished through a direct transfer of funding from the NETL to the M&O contractor and/or National Laboratory.  Even though participation of an M&O and/or National Laboratory may be appropriate, their participation cannot exceed thirty-five (35) percent of the applicant's total estimated project cost.

<DESC>The General Services Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) is an independent quasi-judicial tribunal which adjudicates disputes between civilian agencies of the federal government and their contractors.  The Board also settles claims by federal employees for travel and relocation expenses, and by common carriers for government transportation charges.

The GSBCA is interested in entering into an agreement with a firm willing to provide access to a system by means of which party filings and Board orders and decisions in GSBCA cases can be accessed and exchanged via internet.  

This system is not intended to be the exclusive method for exchanging documentation among the Board and parties to its various proceedings.  Only public documents could be filed through the system; confidential documents would be handled separately.  Parties, however, will be encouraged by the Board to qualify for access and use of the system whenever possible.  

ANY SYSTEM PROPOSED FOR GSBCA CONSIDERATION MUST MEET THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:

1.	Shall be convenient to use;
2.	Shall be reliable and virtually error free;
3.	Shall not require the Board to purchase additional or special equipment to receive,  copy or store filings;
4.	Shall accept documents in a number of commonly used formats (e.g. Word, Word Perfect, or Rich Text Format).
5.	Shall make original filings available in read-only format; preferably, will also make filings available in editable format as well; 
6.	Shall provide access to qualified users through the use of passwords;
7.	Shall make filings available in searchable form, and shall include an engine for making searches; 
8.	Shall alert promptly all interested parties that a document has been posted in the system either by the Board or by another party to the proceedings; 
9.	Shall retain permanently in the system data base all Board orders and decisions; all other documentation relating to a case will be retained in the system for at least six months after action on the case has become final;
10.	Shall make the materials in the system data base pertaining to GSBCA cases susceptible to periodic downloading by case number for storage by the Board;
 
11.	Shall ensure that all word-processing files retain their internal structure (e.g. fonts, footnotes, headings) and pagination when they are uploaded or downloaded between the vendor's system files and the Board's document management system;  
12.	Shall ensure that the system's web pages appear the same when viewed by popular web browsers on desktop or laptop computers;
13.	Shall not require extensive training, either for the Board or for parties to Board proceedings; any necessary training should be free.


CHARGES:  

The system manager may charge parties a reasonable per-filing or per-page rate for all documentation they submit to the system.  The Board will not be charged for documentation it provides to parties through the system.  

Neither the Board nor any other user having access to the system will be charged for review of documentation posted on the system.  

Users having access to the system may be charged a per-page fee for documentation downloaded or printed from the system which does not relate to a proceeding in which the user is an actual participant.

<DESC>The Civil Rights Division (Division) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) requires Architectural Support Services to ensure compliance with Title II and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Standards for Accessible Design. The ADA, among other things, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by places of public accommodation (businesses and non-profit agencies that serve the public) through failure to remove architectural and communications barriers that are structural in nature in places of public accommodation when it is readily achievable to do so. The law also establishes technical requirements for new construction of and alterations to places of public accommodation, commercial facilities (other businesses), and public entities (State and local governments). The Division will investigate alleged non-compliance with the ADA in covered facilities in response to administrative complaints and initiate compliance reviews of new construction and alterations projects. The Division seeks one architectural firm to provide support services in the investigation of complaints and compliance reviews. These services will primarily include reviewing architectural plans to determine compliance with the ADA, performing site survey investigations to gather all data necessary to determine compliance with the ADA, and preparing reports based upon plan and site survey review findings. Additional services may include providing advice on ways to modify plans or buildings to comply with the ADA, preparing design proposals and/or cost estimates to illustrate proposed solutions to bring facilities into ADA compliance, and providing expert consultation services on complex or specialized facilities. However, the primary purpose of this contract is to provide plan review and site survey review services and is not to provide building design services. The selected firm shall have specialized knowledge of accessible design and the ADA and shall have demonstrated specialized experience which includes reviewing architectural plans, performing site survey investigations, and preparing design work in compliance with Title II and Title III of the ADA and the Standards for Accessible Design. In order to avoid a potential organizational conflict of interest, prior to commencing work on each order from the schedule of services, the selected architectural firm (contractor) shall notify the Division if it has any past, present, or anticipated future role related to any facility or entity that is referred to the firm for investigation. In addition, the contractor will be prohibited from accepting any work from a firm that is currently being investigated by the Division until all the issues prompting the investigation have been resolved to the satisfaction of the Government. Selection evaluation criteria, with numbers one and two being of equal importance and the rest listed in descending order of importance are: (1) professional qualifications, including professional license, necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services; (2) specialized experience and technical competence in reviewing architectural plans and performing site surveys of covered facilities to determine compliance with the ADA; (3) technical ability to review facilities of all types and sizes with a firm's own resources or those of subcontractors; (4) ability to work simultaneously on a number of orders and complete work within the required times; (5) ability to provide the required services throughout the United States with a firm's own resources or those of subcontractors and comply with performance schedules; (6) past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with schedules; and (7) demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.  DOJ intends to negotiate and award one indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract. Each order issued against the contract will be on a firm fixed price basis. The initial contract period will be for twelve (12) months with four option periods of twelve (12) months each for a total contract period of sixty (60) months. The estimated value of this contract is between $50,000 and $200,000 per year. The minimum guarantee for the base period will be $10,000.  There will be no minimum guarantee for the option periods.  FIRMS RESPONDING TO THIS NOTICE MUST SUBMIT AN ORIGINAL, AND ONE (1) COPY OF THEIR SF-254 AND SF-255.  Note that we do not have any 254s or 255s on file for this type of work, so only firms that respond to this announcement will be considered.  Responses shall be submitted to the following address so as to be received not later than 2:00 p.m., local (Eastern) time, April 03, 2002:  U.S. Department of Justice, Procurement Services Staff, Attn: R. Steven Frate, National Place Building, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, D.C.  20530.  Responses received at the above location after the established deadline will be considered late and will be handled in accordance with FAR Part 52.215-1, "Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition."

<DESC>N62645-02-R-0006, Amendment 001

The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions submitted by contractors.  NOTE:  Closing date for this requirement is NOT extended and remains March 20, 2002.

Question 1.  On the CCTV portion, the document specifies the use of VCR's, but does not specify the recording mode, (24, 72. 168, etc.).  The document doesn't state how many VCR's, but leads me to believe in the wording that
there is more than one that will be utilized.

Government Response:  There will be a total of 2 recording VCR?s.  One shall be used for a 24 hr surveillance and the second shall be for recording any incident that is triggered by an alarm. 

Question 2.  The document also refers to multiple Pan Tilt Zoom controllers, but isn't specific to how many.

Government Response:  Please change "Pan/Tilt/Zoom controls" to "Pan/Tilt/Zoom control". One Pan Tilt Zoom controller is required that will control the camera located at the main entry.

Question 3.  In the Matrix Switching, the document specifies that is to be capable of expanding, but doesn't specify the extent of expansion, ie: expandable up to how many camera's, and monitors.  The configurations for matrix switchers is determined by basically how many camera's and monitors are put into the system.  Without this information, this could go two ways, we could either specify a matrix switcher that gives you room for
expansion, but not enough, or we could specify a matrix switcher that is an overkill.

Government Response:  The system shall be capable of expanding to a maximum number of 28 cameras and a maximum number of 4 monitors 

Question 4.  On the Access Control portion of this document, Proximity Style card readers are specified in the beginning, but then in the DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS portion of the document, it is asking for 15 KEYPAD SWIPE READERS and 15 CARD SWIPE READERS.  Swipe readers and Proximity readers are two different technologies, could you please specify which of the 2 the document is really calling for.

Government Response:  Delete the 7th sentence of the RFP which reads: "The system shall consist of an access control system with a cardholder management system and proximity style card readers, closed circuit television (CCTV), intrusion detection system, and an environmental alarms system for freezer/refrigerator changes."  Replace it with the following: "The system shall consist of an access control system with a cardholder management system and key pad/card swipe style card readers, closed circuit television (CCTV), intrusion detection system, and an environmental alarms system for freezer/refrigerator changes."  

Question 5.  On the Access Control portion of it again, it refers to door hardware, but is non specific to what type, ie; electric strikes, magnetic locks, etc.

Government Response:  Door hardware to be electric.  In case of power outage, there would need to be a "master switch/key" that would allow manual entry or exit from any space with a lock.

Question 6  In reference to the IDS portion, it refers to 12 motion detectors, but does not specify if they are ceiling mount or wall mount.

Government Response:  Motion detectors to be wall mounted.

Question 7.  For the programmable dialer, it is non specific to how many phone numbers need to be programmed into it.

Government Response:  The programmed dialing system shall be capable of dialing 2 operator programmed numbers.  

Question 8.  How many sirens are needed for the IDS?

Government Response:  Two.

Question 9.  How many zones should the IDS panel be, and will it also need room for expansion, and to what degree?

Government Response:  Currently three zones with expansion capability for one more.  Zone 1 will encompass 2nd Deck rooms 217, 217-A, 217-B and 219.  Zone 2 will be the rest of 2nd Deck.  Zone 3 will be 3rd Deck.

This equipment shall provide all the necessary functions to control two-way radio base stations communications with a Kenwood (LTR) Trunking System.  Other auxiliary functions that this equipment maybe required for are telephones, paging, public address system, electric door release activation, and turning on/off light, cameras, implementing alarm function and related accessories.  This will require at a minimum that the system shall support 1000 Auxiliary Control functions.  A quantity of three (3) Control Console dispatch positions will be required, two (2) primary console positions and one (1) remote console position in excess of 4000 feet from the Emergency Service Dispatch Office.   All equipment shall be of the highest professional quality, reliability and meets or exceeds the latest applicable standards of the FCC, EIA, TIA, IEEE and Public Safety community, particularly APCO 25 standards.  Equipment proposed in which microprocessors or switching power supplies are used shall have undergone comprehensive Electromagnetic Emissions Testing and shall be certified as compliant with Part 15, subpart "J" of the FCC rules for Class "A" computing devices.  The equipment being proposed shall reflect the "state-of-the-art" in control console design.  The console electronics shall utilize distributed microprocessor technology, digital audio processing.  The equipment shall only include items, which are currently in design and production; prototype or sunset designs will not be considered.  The console shall directly interface with single and multi-site trunked system controllers and shall allow interoperability between trunked and non-trunked channels in the systems.  The Control Console system shall be designed to enhance the dispatcher capabilities in performing resource management tasks and to minimize the effort and concentration required for efficient radio control.  To enhance the overall flexibility and allow for ease of future expansion, system shall be of totally modular design and construction.  This requirement applies to the cabinetry, electronics and system software.   All console position shall operate in a multitasking environment as part of an integrated client/server network, to be furnished and installed as part of this procurement.  The operating system shall be Microsoft Windows 2000.  Each base station interface card shall be equipped with a dedicated RS232C digital I/O port for digital data communications.  The port communications data rate and protocol shall be fully programmable.  Single Point Failure of any component or module of the console system shall not adversely affect the operation of more the one Operator Position or one transmit/receive radio channel, through the system.  Transmit/receive channels and/or control functions designated by NSWCDD as "critical" shall have redundant, "hot-standby", system controllers provided such that failure of a single component or module shall not adversely affect those channels or functions.  The redundant system controllers shall be physically separate modular assemblies which will be become operational automatically and immediately upon detection of a failure.  Designs in which the redundant controller is incorporated with the primary controller will be unacceptable.
Designs that will not be considered or acceptable for use in the Control Console systems are: (1) Consoles using individual channel modules and/or consoles that use monochrome display; (2) Systems utilizing analog audio schemes with the CEP; (3) A Local Area Network (LAN) or extensive broad-bandwidth connections, such as T-1 or E-1; (4) Video controllers that are integrated with the PC motherboard circuitry; (5) Designs that are based on common UPS for multiple positions or the entire system; (6) Touch screens using pressure sensitive resistive or capacitate technology or which have a reflective coating; (7) Analog switches matrix techniques, because of their inherent susceptibility to RF interference, cross talk and noise degradation of the signal; (8) Designs which combine redundant controller with the primary controller on a single circuit assembly; and (9) Common DC power supply bus or which place any restrictions on the simultaneous use of multiple channel functions.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INDICATION THAT THE NAVY WILL CONTRACT FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. NSWCDD will not pay for information received in response to this RFI. This is a market research tool, seeking innovative business solutions.   This information will be used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to the issuance of any future Request for Proposal (RFP).

<SUBJECT>A -- BAA for Advanced Concepts
<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, MDA has established a Deputy for Advanced Concepts (AC) whose mission is to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  MDA/AC has established an Innovation Cell, which consists of a team of experts to evaluate new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  

The MDA/AC Innovation Cell seeks new and innovative concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following seven technology areas: (1) Radar Systems ? including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Hardware (transmit/receive modules), Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; (2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems ? including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control, Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Focal Plane Arrays, Lethality Mechanisms; (3) Mathematics and Computer Science ? including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Probability and Statistics, and Pattern Recognition; (4) Electrical Engineering ? including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5) Physics and Chemistry ? including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering ? including Space Systems, Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, and Materials Science; and (7) Battle Management/Command and Control ? including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification, Identification, and Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (up to five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offeror?s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below.	
MDA will evaluate these responses based upon the following criteria (all criteria of equal importance): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and the level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offer?s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). 
	
This BAA will remain open until September 30, 2003. Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  

The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur inFYs 2002 ? 2004, and will most likely be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type of arrangement.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Albert Dainton at (703) 695-9174 or email at albert.dainton-contractor@mda.osd.mil.
