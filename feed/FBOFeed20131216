<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Wisconsin Physicians Services under contract number HHSM-500-2011-M0006Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Concurrent Computer Corporation on a sole source basis. Concurrent Computer Corporation (CCC) provides systems with their proprietary RedHawk Linux real-time operating system.  Because of the complexity of the real-time computing, the systems running the real-time operating system shall be certified by the provider of the systems.  All peripheral I/O devices and their associated driver software shall be certified by the real-time operation system vendor.  CCCs RedHawk real-time operating system is the real-time operating system currently used in the IATF labs; therefore, any subsequent real-time systems shall be purchased with this operating system.  Any new systems purchased without this operating system would not be compatible with existing systems already in use in the IATF labs. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to charles.a.holt@nasa.gov no later than 7:00 a.m. CST on December 19, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>******PLEASE CONTACT MARY BRINKLEY/ARCS ONLY FOR ALL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR CONSIDERATION REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. MARY BRINKLEY'S/ARCS CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION****** NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center has a requirement for the hardware maintenance of the ImaGen systems supporting the development lines used in the Integrated Avionics Test Facilities (IATF) under the Vehicle Integration project within the Space Launch Systems (SLS) Program.	NASA/MSFC intends to procure these services from Concurrent Computer Corporation (CCC). Competition is impractical for the following reasons: CCC provided these ImaGen systems with their proprietary RedHawk Linux real-time operating system. CCC provides the certification for these systems.  They test and integrate in-house to guarantee real-time performance that meets the IATF's specific requirements. The IATF labs are integral to the SLS avionics systems.  Maintaining the compatibility of the systems within these facilities is necessary for reliability and efficiency.  Not continuing the maintenance of these systems provided by CCC or choosing another vendor would seriously impact the integrity and compatibility of these systems and the ongoing work in the labs thus not meeting the Government need. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Mary.M.Brinkley@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 20, 2013.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Gene DX, 207 Perry Parkway, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20877 for a follow-on Molecular Diagnostics and Cytogenetics Rare Disorders Fellows Training for NHGRI.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement:</strong></p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals. Division of Intramural Research (DIR) was established to serve as a hub where development of technology for the rapid isolation and analysis of disease genes will be carried out. The DIR's basic research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to conduct research in medical genetics. Research includes identifying and understanding the molecular basis of human genetic disease and planning and carrying out clinical trials to test methods for the treatment. The mission of the DIR includes the training of physicians and doctoral degree fellows in genetics and genomics through the Medical Genetics and Genomic Medicine Residency and Fellowship Training Programs.</p>
<p>These programs are administered by the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) and are accredited by the American Board of Medical Genetics (ABMG).Requirements for board certification of competency of our trainees includes laboratory experiences in cytogenetics and molecular genetics, including genomics. To meet these requirements the Medical Genetics Branch and OCD seek nearby institutions to provide these components of training for board certification in Clinical Genetics, Clinical Molecular Genetics, Clinical Biochemical Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics. The laboratory experience of the trainees must include a wide array of molecular diagnostic testing in the fields of neurodegenerative disorders, late onset disorders, imprinting disorders, mental retardation, neuromuscular disorders, and metabolic diseases, including prenatal diagnosis. In addition, the training in cytogenetics must include conventional karyotyping as well as FISH and microarrays in both pre- and post-natal settings.</p>
<p>The laboratory aspect of the training program will need to be conducted in diagnostic laboratories with equipment and personnel to provide the hands-on experience required for board certification by ABMB. The staff, which must include ABMG board certified laboratory directors, will be required to train fellows in applicable laboratory techniques and the clinical interpretation and implications of the test results. The staff must also participate in the comprehensive teaching of fellows; including participation in lecture series, journal clubs, and case conferences. The cost of disposable supplies used by trainees will be included in the contract.</p>

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<CONTACT>Andrew Flynn, Contract Specialist, Email flynn.andrew@epa.gov - Rob Flowers, Contracting Officer, Email flowers.Rob@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) is continuously involved in analyzing existing and prospective legislation, regulations, treaties, and other policy instruments as they relate to the energy, economic and environmental effects of air and radiation protection programs.  The OAR is often required to undertake short-term analyses (one week to two months) on diverse subjects due to inquiries from Congress, the Executive Branch, industry and the public.  In addition, the OAR is often required to undertake longer-term analyses requiring multi-disciplinary expertise and cross-disciplinary integration applied in the context of policy and program assessment.  These longer-term analyses also serve the needs of the Agency, Congress, and other decision makers charged with evaluating national and international air and radiation related policies and programs.
<p>To respond to these inquiries in a timely manner, the OAR requires analytical support in evaluating the energy, economic, technological, financial, social, human health, environmental, and ecological effects of a broad range of existing and potential future government policies and regulations.  In addition, the OAR requires logistical support in developing tools, materials, and forums to communicate the potential effects of changes in government policy and to facilitate communication and potential resolution of issues identified by competing stakeholders.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the Office of Policy Analysis and Review (OPAR) of the EPA OAR is to provide policy analysis, policy and program development, program review, and communications support directly to the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation and, at times, directly to the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the EPA.  Given these broad, high-level responsibilities, OPAR requires contractor analytical support which is multi-disciplinary yet which is conducted in a manner which facilitates the reconciliation of diverse disciplinary perspectives, methods of inquiry, and analytical interpretations.</p>
<p>The EPA anticipates the award of a cost-plus fixed fee, level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods. The anticipated contract award date is May 2014.  The total duration of the proposed contracts is sixty (60) months for a total of 84,000 labor hours consisting of a base quantity of 8,400 labor hours and 8,400 optional quantity labor hours for the base year and each option period. This effort is a follow-on to contracts EP-D-09-053 with ICF and EP-D-09-054 with IEC, both of which expire on March 31, 2014. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $14.0M in average annual receipts over the last three years. The draft Conflict of Interest (COI) clauses can be reviewed at EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.</p>
<p>The solicitation is scheduled to be issued on or around January 15, 2014 and will be for Full and Open Competition. Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation. The solicitation and amendments will be available online at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments via the Internet. If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via the Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) is continuously involved in analyzing existing and prospective legislation, regulations, treaties, and other policy instruments as they relate to the energy, economic and environmental effects of air and radiation protection programs.  The OAR is often required to undertake short-term analyses (one week to two months) on diverse subjects due to inquiries from Congress, the Executive Branch, industry and the public.  In addition, the OAR is often required to undertake longer-term analyses requiring multi-disciplinary expertise and cross-disciplinary integration applied in the context of policy and program assessment.  These longer-term analyses also serve the needs of the Agency, Congress, and other decision makers charged with evaluating national and international air and radiation related policies and programs.
<p>To respond to these inquiries in a timely manner, the OAR requires analytical support in evaluating the energy, economic, technological, financial, social, human health, environmental, and ecological effects of a broad range of existing and potential future government policies and regulations.  In addition, the OAR requires logistical support in developing tools, materials, and forums to communicate the potential effects of changes in government policy and to facilitate communication and potential resolution of issues identified by competing stakeholders.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the Office of Policy Analysis and Review (OPAR) of the EPA OAR is to provide policy analysis, policy and program development, program review, and communications support directly to the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation and, at times, directly to the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the EPA.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS (PRE-SOLICITATION) <br> W91236-13-B-0013 <br>  <br> THIS PROCUREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District has a requirement for maintenance dredging to remove critical shoals from the channels and restore previously authorized navigable depth and to provide safe access for shallow draft vessels transiting the Tangier Channels.   <br>  <br> The Tangier Channels Federal navigation project was authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 2 March 1919 and modified by the P.W.A. Acts of 3 January 1934 and 30 August 1935 and the River and Harbor Act of 2 March 1946. The project was also modified in 1964 under Section 107 of the River and Harbor Act o 14 July 1960 to provide for a channel from the basin through Tangier Creek westward to the Chesapeake Bay. The funding for this maintenance dredging event at Tangier Island is provided by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act: Public Law 113-2. <br>  <br> This project consists of dredging the Tangier Channels Federal Navigation Channel.  The work consists of maintenance dredging to a required depth of 8 feet MLLW in the East Channel, 7 feet MLLW in the Turning Basin, and 7 feet MLLW in the West Channel.  All depths have a two foot allowable overdepth.  The dredging involves approximately 55,500 cubic yards of material, including allowable overdepth dredging and estimated accretion to November 2013.  The work shall be performed by a cutter-head pipeline dredge with all dredged material transported by pipeline and placed in the designated overboard placement area. <br>  <br> The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract using INVITATION FOR BID WITH PRE-AWARD SURVEY and procedures outlined in FAR Parts 36 and 14. Pre-award survey will determine contractor's responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104 and 9.106. <br>  <br> Bidders will be evaluated on both pre-award survey and conformance to the solicitation and price. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Bids; and to award the contract to other than the lowest total price and to award to the bidder submitting the lowest bid determined by the Government to be responsible. The magnitude of construction is estimated between $1,000,000.00-$5,000,000.00. <br>  <br> The anticipated date of the solicitation is on or about 19 September 2013.  <br>  <br> NAICS CODE 237990 applies to this procurement. Submission requirements (plans/specs) will be available on/about 19 September 2013 via Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps, https://www.fbo.gov). Bid bonds will be required with Bid submittals. Search on W91236% for solicitations issued by Norfolk District. No hard copies will be available. Prospective contractors must be registered Vendors with https://www.fbo.gov in order to download plans and specifications. Prospective contractors MUST be registered in the DOD System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to obtain access to FedBizOpps. It is incumbent upon vendors to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation, specification, drawings, and all subsequent amendments. SAM Registration must also be ACTIVE and current to be eligible for contract award. Information on registration and <br> annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov. Lack of registration in the SAM database will prevent access to FedBizOpps and will make a Bidder ineligible for award.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION	 <br>  <br> 1.0 CONTRACT INFORMATION <br> General.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6 and EP 715-1-7, Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE.  This acquisition will be used to procure highly specialized services required to provide continued Architect-Engineer (A-E) design services in support of the Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program.  The FRR program provides quick response to repair/renewal situations relating to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, instrumentation, communications, security, safety, systems, and cost, as well as environmental and hazardous materials abatement areas of Government facilities.  Sometimes the Government accomplishes the FRR projects through other design/build contracts; however, some projects will require that an AE prepare a design package (work plan) that will then be executed by a construction contractor under another solicitation.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Huntsville Center is one of the Army's leaders in studies as well as execution, and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide expertise and the highest quality research facility, life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other Federal agencies and foreign governments.  In order to accomplish this objective Huntsville Center proposes to award a Restricted Small Business Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). These awards will be ID/IQ contracts, with a one (1) year base and four (4) one (1) year options; Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated, with secondary criteria being used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. It is anticipated that this acquisition will result in award of a target of three (3) contracts, with the Government reserving the right to award more, less, or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Task orders (TO) will be awarded with FY13-17 funds, subject to the availability of funds, with a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 541310.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the Facility Repair and Renewal Program on A-E contracts are anticipated to total approximately $9,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.  This acquisition is a small business set-aside restricted competition.  Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and have the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.  In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor, the A-E Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract.  The Contractor shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Contractor may perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contracts resulting from the A-E services, however, the A-E contractor will not be responsible for the direct performance of the construction itself.  In accordance with FAR 52.219-14, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor on a contract reserved for small business.  <br>  <br> 1.1 In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction contracts that relate to any A-E Task Orders awarded under this contract.

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation, but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only. <br /><br />1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which have a corresponding Size standard of 750 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.
<p>2. To increase competition and small business utilization, when a sources sought synopses is utilized, it shall be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website for a minimum of 14 calendar days for acquisitions expected to be equal to or exceed $150,000 but not more than $3M, and for a minimum of 30 calendar days for acquisitions expected to exceed $3M. In those rare instances where these posting requirements do not support urgent procurement timelines, the Chief of the Contracting Office may waive the requirement. Sources sought synopses shall also be coordinated with the appropriate SB office prior to posting on FBO to ensure language is appropriately framed and optimized for maximum small business interest and responsiveness. This policy shall be effective 45 days after issuance of the memo; however, contracting officers should implement sooner where acquisition schedules allow.</p>
<p>3. Program Details:</p>
<p>3.1 The following information is provided to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully provide the described capability. The Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) have a requirement for an off-the-shelf, proven F-16 Missile Warning System (MWS) for their F-16 aircraft. AFLCMC/WWMPA F-16 Integration Section, Hill AFB, UT intends to award a contract to convert PIDSU (Pylon Integrated Dispenser System Universal) pylons to PIDS+ (Pylon Integrated Dispenser System Plus) for MWS installation. MWS is required to improve survivability against man portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS). PIDSU (Pylon Integrated Dispenser System Universal), designed, manufactured and sold to ANG/AFRC by TERMA, Denmark, is a suspension rack currently flying on F-16C/D Blocks 25/30/32 aircraft. ANG/AFRC currently own 310 PIDSU pylons, and anticipates modifying some to a PIDS+ (or equivalent) configuration.</p>
<p>This action is being conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirement. All potential sources must describe their approach to the following items in an unclassified response:</p>
<p>a. The potential source must have the interface knowledge, expertise, and experience to work with the PIDSU/PIDS+ pylon and the AN/ALQ-213 Countermeasures System.<br />b. The potential source must demonstrate prior experience with achieving SEEK EAGLE certification with MWS on aircraft pylons.<br />c. PIDSU/PIDS+ modifications must be able to accommodate different sensor and processor systems, and still meet the F-16 MWS SEEK EAGLE qualification requirements - this implies that the MWS modified pylons remain within current PIDS+ Outer Mold Lines to avoid additional SEEK EAGLE testing.<br />d. The requirement for initial production version installs is July 2015.<br />e. Prototype versions of PIDS+ pylons may be required before July 2015 for government testing of sensor and processor systems.<br />f. The potential source must provide evidence that it is qualified and has obtained all necessary data and legal agreements to convert the PIDSU to PIDS+.</p>
<p>4. This is a request for information seeking sources capable of meeting the requirements in the Purchase Description. When responding please include:</p>
<p>a. Company Name and Cage code.<br />b. Who is your POC? Please provide an email address and phone number.<br />c. Experiences with same or similar items. Please describe.<br />d. Suggested NAICS Code.<br />e. Business Size Classification for NAICS and qualifications if any and any sub-category. <br />f. Would you be a prime or subcontractor?<br />g. Lead Time for the task performance.</p>

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <br>  <br> Purpose and Objective for the Procurement: <br>  <br> The purpose of this acquisition is for an Intrusion Detection system (IDS) and supported equipment. ACC has a continuing need for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and supported equipment. USAGAPG is the host activity for over 80 tenant activities and, as such, is responsible for providing security assistance to include IDS design, installation, and maintenance. IDS is an integral part of the overall security posture for APG and Tenant Activities that have very unique facilities that require specific means of protection. <br> ACC must provide Security Systems to Tenant Activities to include equipment, delivery, installation, and maintenance of new and existing security devices/systems. The Garrison in conjunction with Tenant Activities identifies areas in which systems are needed or need to be upgraded to ensure the appropriate regulations are followed. This system support includes providing technical assistance and training in the operation, and testing of the systems and related equipment. <br> The Company must be able to provide support to the current equipment that is installed on APG.  Any replacement of equipment that cannot be supported will be at the expense of the company and not the government. <br> Draft Statement of Work:  see document attached below. <br>  <br> All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Patrick Siemon, Contract Specialist, e-mail: patrick.d.siemon.civ@mail.mil in MS Word within 07 calendar days of the date of this announcement.

The work of the project includes the installation of fiber optic cable and innerduct from the FAA's Southern California TRACON (SCT) facility to the nearby U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California in accordance with the attached project documents.

A TIERED EVALUATION of offers will be used in this source selection.  The FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified below.  Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible, small business concerns were received.  At least two qualied offers in a given tier are required in order to consider an award.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next higher lettered tier until an award can be made.  All responsible, competitive offers in a single tier will be considered equally for award.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):

(1)  Socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.

(2)  Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).

(3)  Small Businesses (as determined by the applicable NAICS code, which, in this case is: 238210 Size Standard - $14M.

(4)  Other-than Small Businesses.

Once the appropriate pool of offers has been determined in accordance with the tiered evaluation method, the qualifying offers will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria listed in the RFO.  Once an offer is determined to be technically acceptable, an award will be made to the lowest priced offeror.

The estimated price range for this project is between: $100,000.00 to $250,000.

<DESC>Solicitation # HHSNIHOPCSS 14-002702<br />Closing Date: December 19, 2013
<p><br />This is a small business Sources Sought notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals abstracts, or quotation. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources: HUBZONE small businesses: service -disabled; veteran-owned small businesses 8(a) small businesses; veteran -owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses or small disadvantage businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition methods: including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><br /><br />Background</p>
<p><br />The Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD), Infectious Disease Section is responsible for developing new proteomic methods and using the methods to support both clinical needs and fundamental research at the National Institute of Health (NIH) Mass Spectrometer instrument is currently being used to identify bacterial proteins with a goal of more rapid bacterial identification from Clinical samples. The purpose may result in advance in patient care that will improve diagnosis and treatment of lung infections. The maintenance and repair instrument is essential in avoiding interruption of sample analysis and consequently delaying the clinical usage, this instrument repair must be completed using the original parts, which includes repair, parts labor, and travel cost under the service contract. The technical support engineers must be available via phone between 8 am and 5 PM EST. Therefore, Agilent Technologies expertise is deemed necessary to provide engineering upgrades and maintenance procedure of Mass Spectrometer support services for patients in need of life support and other intensive medical interventions.</p>
<p><br />Work to be performed</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center Critical Care Medicine Department provides clinical care for patients in need of life support and other intensive medical interventions. Since the NIH-Clinical Center is the world's largest clinical research facility, the hospital has patients from across the country and around the world who have challenging and complex underlying diseases. While being evaluated and treated with conventional and investigational therapies, these patients may develop life threatening sepsis, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver failure, and neurologic dysfunction that require medical management.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>LC/MS is a chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. LC/MS is a powerful technique used for many applications, which has very high sensitivity and selectivity. Generally its application is oriented towards the general detection and potential identification of chemicals in the presence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture).</p>
<p>The LC time-of-flight Mass Spectrometer (Agilent technologies) in our Lab is used for many clinical and fundamental purposes including the identification of bacterial proteins for rapid microbiological identification. This purpose may result in advances in patient care that will improve diagnosis and treatment of lung infections. Maintenance and repair of the instrument is essential in avoiding interruption of sample analysis, and consequently delaying the clinical usage.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>Critical Care Medicine is requesting a one-year service contract. The following shall be included as part of the service plan:</p>
<p>&bull;Instrument repair must be completed using only original parts.<br />&bull;Instrument repair, parts, labor, and travel costs should be covered under the service contract.<br />&bull;Parts should be available for next day delivery in case of initial service call misdiagnoses instrument problem.<br />&bull;Customer technical support on Mass Spectrometer must be available via phone between 8am and 5pm EST.</p>
<p>Selective Criteria</p>
<p>&bull;Service engineers must have complete system-certified training on the Agilent technologies' Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometer.<br />&bull;Instrument must be repaired with original manufactured parts.<br />&bull;Service should be replacement of all consumable parts, as well as testing of the instrument for optimal operation.</p>
<p><br />Justification for Agilent as Sole Service Provider</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />&bull;Agilent is the manufacturer of the instrument and sole source for factory service from authorized representatives, which includes software and hardware telephone support and at-your-site support services from factory trained representatives. &bull;<br />&bull;Only Agilent authorized service providers are able to attend factory training, including update training, and to receive ongoing service notes for Agilent products.<br />&bull;Because Agilent training typically occurs quarterly or bi-annually, and updates are provided continuously, no unauthorized service providers can provide current factory trained personnel throughout the term of a typical one year service agreement (even if a vendor employs one or more ex&shy; Agilent employees).<br />&bull;Agilent is the sole source of genuine component parts and replacement parts. And, Agilent's global service parts logistics network manages a $30M+ inventory of parts with greater than 96&deg;/o on-time service parts delivery performance.<br />&bull;Agilent is the sole source for proprietary factory recommended software updates/upgrades, engineering upgrades and maintenance procedures.<br />&bull;Agilent is the exclusive provider of Agilent Remote Advisor, the only platform capable of accessing and monitoring built-in system intelligence from Agilent instruments to provide remote diagnostics and detailed operational reports.<br />&bull;Agilent is the sole source of Agilent Enterprise Edition qualification procedures and the Agilent Compliance Engine software providing automated, metrology-based compliance testing.<br />&bull;Agilent is the sole contact for escalation to Agilent's factory for engineering expertise and, if deemed necessary by Agilent, replacement of an entire instrument at no cost while covered by an Agilent service agreement through the Agilent Service Guarantee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Introduction
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The mission of the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is to ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by supporting research that can lead to the prevention, treatment, and eventual cure of HIV disease.</p>
<p>DAIDS supports basic research as well as pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of various HIV eradication strategies. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies at clearing the latent HIV reservoir, a sensitive, reproducible assay capable of quantifying latent HIV is crucial. The best characterized assay today is the QVOA (Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay), also known as IUPM (Infectious Units Per Million) assay (Siliciano and Siliciano 2005), performed on highly purified resting CD4+ T cells under conditions that reverse latency and induce replication of HIV.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The objective of this contract is to provide the QVOA as a service to the HIV research community. This service will allow standardized QVOA measurements so that unbiased comparisons between different eradication strategies can be achieved. Widespread use of the assay will raise the standards for latent HIV detection and reduce the need for surrogate, less sensitive assays, presently used by some laboratories.</p>
<p>The scope of the work includes:<br />&bull;Performance of the QVOA <br />&bull;Development of alternatives to the QVOA. The aim will be the development of assays that are less costly, require smaller amounts of blood, and can be completed more rapidly while maintaining or exceeding the sensitivity of the QVOA.<br />&bull;Training investigators to perform the QVOA at the Respondent's site.</p>
<p>The Respondent shall use state-of-the art technologies to accomplish the objectives of the contract and shall incorporate new and improved technologies into activities when appropriate.</p>
<p>Project requirements<br />A.Perform Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA): the Contractor shall perform the direct quantitation of replication competent HIV in latently infected resting CD4+ T cells of HIV patients on HAART. The assay shall be able to detect, at a minimum, one latently infected cell per one million resting CD4+ T cells (Siliciano and Siliciano 2005).</p>
<p>B.Develop alternatives to the QVOA: In consultation with of the COR, the Contractor shall develop alternatives to QVOA that are less costly, require smaller amounts of blood, are less labor intensive, and maintain the sensitivity of the QVOA.</p>
<p>C.Provide training in the performance of the QVOA. In consultation with the COR, provide training for researchers to establish the QVOA at their own lab. Training may be provided at the Contractor's site.</p>
<p>D.Disseminate findings to the scientific community.</p>
<p>E.Organize one site visit per year.</p>
<p>F.Collect, manage, and quality control data. Ensure confidentiality of data related to study subjects. Ensure integrity of scientific data. Provide quality control procedures for all data generated under the contract such as scientific data, Contractor and subcontractor/consultant reports, etc.</p>
<p>G.Receive, store, ship, and inventory contract resources, study products, and clinical specimens.</p>
<p>H.Provide for appropriate storage and monitoring of virus stocks, study products, specimens, and other material. Use shipping procedures and containers that comply with International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations (www.iata.org) for shipment by air transportation or with Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations for shipment by ground transportation.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about May 15, 2015. The requirement will be for the delivery of 3.30 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>In addition to the above functions and services to be provided for the Base period, the Government may exercise, at its discretion, Options for additional level of effort as follows: 1) Options to extend the term of the contract; and 2) Options to accommodate significant increases in work. These Options are defined as follows:</p>
<p>1)Options 1 through 6 to Extend the Term of the Contract<br />The Government may exercise options to extend the period of the contract beyond the base period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years. Assume that the scope and types of activities as outlined herein (i.e., for Year 1 of the contract) would be continued for each succeeding annual contract period up to 7 total years.</p>
<p>2)Options 7 through 20: Increase in Services<br />The Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the services supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include the following:</p>

<DESC>In its pursuit of enhanced and unmatched agility, lethality, mobility, and survivability for the future expeditionary forces, ONR Code 30 is seeking information from US and non-US sources to identify new concepts, areas of research and approaches to provide non-conventional 3-dimensional mobility of a Marine during Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), conventional theaters of operation, open field terrain, and littoral areas. There is a need for new and novel transportation concepts to provide the warfighter with superior combat and tactical mobility in three-dimensions (2D-planar and vertical) with which to gain access to restricted or denied areas and terrain. The concepts of interest are those that currently do not exist as a system or technique, but rather are new phenomenon or technological advances that may produce new 3-D mobility capabilities in 2 to 10 years. Concepts do not necessarily need to be complete systems. They may be discoveries or research that has the potential of overcoming the challenges of three-dimensional mobility for vehicle systems. The concepts that enable this capability can include, but are not limited to, non air powered vertical lift and propulsion methods, advanced lightweight materials, and high power dense systems. The concepts that enable this capability should focus on three-dimensional mobility of 1 to 2 Marines per mechanism.
<p>ONR 30 is also seeking information from US and non-US sources to identify new concepts, areas of research and approaches to increasing dismounted Marine mobility in a 2D-planar or 3-D mission environment. There is a need for new and novel mobility concepts to provide the warfighter with superior combat and tactical mobility in dismounted environments. The concepts of interest are those that currently do not exist as a system or technique, but rather are new phenomenon or technological advances that may produce revolutionary dismounted mobility capabilities in 2 to 10 years. The concepts that enable this capability can include, but are not limited to, managing warfighter material loads, providing environmental protection and conditioning, enhancing warfighter traversing speeds and/or agility, power, and computing capabilities, and may be in the form of an exoskeleton. These concepts should focus on serving one Marine per mechanism</p>

<p>The U.S.A.F. is seeking to identify potential contractors qualified to perform professional utility piping repair and replacement services at Eielson AFB, AK. This posting is a Sources Sought for interested vendors and is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. This posting is not a Request for Proposal. Responders' are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to the sources sought; all costs associated with responding to this will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted on the FedBizOps website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>The work to be performed shall include but is not limited to: <br />Eielson AFB maintains a system of utilidors/utiliducts that provide a safe, dry environment for piping/distribution utilities (domestic water, heating water supply and return, steam and condensate, sewer). However, there are still a few locations that have direct buried piping. This piping has proved to be problematic, requiring more frequent repairs and increased time/effort by on-base operations personnel. Due to the worsening conditions and to keep up with demand, 354 CES requires a new IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contract specifically to repair/replace direct-buried piping as breaks occur. Specific work locations will be indicated with each individual delivery order (as breaks occur) should a contract result from this requirement. Work is planned to be limited solely to direct-bury piping; no repairs will be done inside of utiliducts/utilidors. <br />The contractor shall provide all management, supervision, personnel, labor, equipment, vehicles, materials, tools, machinery and other items and services necessary to perform individual delivery orders. Each delivery order will require excavation, repair to underground utility infrastructure (which can include water, sewer, steam systems) and post-repair backfill activities. All work will be performed in accordance with Eielson AFB standards and guides, commercial and industry standards, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. <br />The Government is contemplating a Firm-Fixed price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to include (1) one base year plus (4) four option years. The estimated disclosure of magnitude is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<br />The U.S.A.F. is requesting the following information from interested vendors:<br />&bull; Company name, point of contact information to include phone number and email<br />&bull; Positive statement of your interest in this procurement as a prime contractor<br />&bull; DUNS number and CAGE code<br />&bull; Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon Proposed work to be performed under the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: 237110 for Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued for the purpose of understanding the range of services available for transforming PowerBuilder software to a JAVA code base in support of transitioning Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) to an Open Architecture (OA) web-based and/or Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) based Automated Information System to replace the current client server based NTCSS.  NTCSS provides the unit commanding officer of ships, submarines, aviation squadrons, and intermediate maintenance (afloat and ashore) activities the ability to manage: ship/aircraft maintenance, parts inventory, finances, tech manuals and drawings, and personnel nformation. In order for NTCSS to meet future Navy and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements, NTCSS must transition from a client-server architecture to a modern and sustainable Open Architecture (OA). OA in this context can include web-based and/or SOA based application functionality. The current In-Service NTCSS system continues to incur increased maintenance and operational risk due to information assurance  vulnerabilities with an aging baseline as well as expanding technology gaps with modern OA based systems. Transitioning to an OA environment will allow for better utilization of  resources and improve reliability, reusability, and reduce overall total ownership cost. Responses are requested no later than 13 January 2014 at 13:00 PDT.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request, as such, neither unsolicited proposals nor offers of any kind will be considered in response to this RFI.  No contract award will result from responses to this notice, nor reimbursement for any costs associated with providing information in response to this request. 

The Department of Veteran Affairs, Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) is issuing this RFI as a means of conducting market research to identify qualified contractors with the capability and resources to meet the Veteran Health Administration's (VHA) requirement.

The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified manufacturers or distributors and their size classification for pulmonary, otolaryngology and urology flexible endoscopes to assist the Department of Veterans Affairs with market research for planning purposes.  

The information sought pertains to pricing, delivery, and company capabilities (such as commercial lease terms and conditions, including standard lease lengths, information on all inclusive maintenance and repair type arrangements, policies and delivery timeframe information on providing replacement or loaner equipment during periods of equipment servicing, and types of user training, to include overview of topics covered in training).  Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The result of this market research will contribute to determining commercial availability of endoscopes while assisting with procurement planning and contributing to the method of procurement and resultant contract type.  Based on the information a determination by the government will be made to issue a solicitation and using the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.  At this time, the suggested NAICS code(s) assigned to this procurement is 334510 (endoscopic equipment, electromedical (e.g. bronchoscopes, colonoscopies, cytoscopes), manufacturing with a Small Business Administration size standard of 500 employees.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: 


Pulmonary Bronchoscopes
	
Basic Definition
	Flexible bronchoscopes are used to examine the airway or bronchial passages of the lung, in the bronchoscopy suite or at the bedside in hospitalized patients.  The airway and bronchial mucosa are visualized either by a lens on the proximal end of the endoscope, or by realtime video images displayed on a monitor from a camera at the distal tip of the endoscope.  Flexible bronchoscopy is used for diagnosis of lung infections, inflammation, and benign/malignant lung tumors.  The working channels of bronchoscopes for instrumentation allow for therapeutic procedures such as biopsy, injection, lavage, and suction.  A special bronchoscope is also available that has both endoscope and ultrasound functions.  This scope allows targeted biopsy of lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilum of the lung, using ultrasound to guide needle biopsy of the nodes.  The video processor support equipment interfaced or connected to the bronchoscopes, allows the capture and recording of still and video images in high definition that can then be uploaded into the electronic medical record.

Urology Flexible Scopes
	Basic Definition
	Flexible cystoscopy is an essential tool used in Urology to examine the urethra and bladder in both the outpatient and inpatient settings. Internal structures are viewed by either direct use of a lens at the proximal end of the scope or by using a camera attached to the proximal end of the scope allowing viewing on a video monitor. Urologists utilize flexible cystoscopy to identify pathology (involving both the proximal and distal urethra, including the prostatic urethra) resulting in voiding problems or possible cancer in these locations.  Cystoscopy is an essential part of evaluating the bladder in its entirety, looking for causes of bleeding like tumors or stones. Cytsoscopes with working channels are used to remove foreign bodies like stents, lavage of debri or blood clots from the bladder and biopsies of abnormal appearing lesions. The videoprocessor captures and records still and video images in high definition, that can then be uploaded into the electronic medical record.

Access should include perpetual data rights to the content that is made available to USDA during the performance period. The contractor shall provide, on request by USDA, all subscribed-to purchased content in a mutually agreed-upon non-proprietary format. CSIRO Publishing is an autonomous business unit within Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, CSIRO. CSIRO Publishing operates as an independent science and technology publisher. CSIRO's internationally recognized publishing program covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, including agriculture, the plant and animal sciences, and environmental management. CSIRO's products are published in print and electronically, and their product range includes journals, books, magazines and CD-ROMs.&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, is Australia's national science agency. CSIRO is committed to Australia's National Research Priorities, which have to do with climate adaptation, energy transformation, food futures, future manufacturing, mining, human and animal health, water, and ocean resources. CSIRO Publishing operates as an independent science and technology publisher with a global reputation for quality products and services. It's internationally recognized publishing program covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, including agriculture, the plant and animal sciences, and environmental management. CSIRO publishes 36 journals, nearly all of which have content of interest to USDA researchers. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">NAL first acquired electronic access to CSIRO journals in 2007, in response to USDA researchers' demands for access to the journals via NAL's DigiTop service. Since that time, USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of CSIRO journal content to their research by their heavy use of electronic journals. For example, during calendar year 2011, USDA researchers used CSIRO electronic journals 5,132 times. Besides its extremely important journal content, CSIRO has well developed mechanisms for delivering the content to subscribers. Its platform efficiently provides access to CSIRO journals. CSIRO's continual investment in its information infrastructure and its compliance with newly emerging industry standards makes its information delivery mechanisms extremely good, and allows CSIRO to produce desirable products and services such as its metadata service, as adjuncts to its journal publications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">CSIRO is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for CSIRO journal access with perpetual rights to the content issued during the period of performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CSIRO is the only copyright holder of its publications and thus is the only source of the perpetual data rights NAL seeks. No source other than CSIRO provides the perpetual data rights for CSIRO electronic journals and journal metadata. The CSIRO website does not provide the names of any other vendors. Having perpetual data rights granted by CSIRO will give USDA users access in perpetuity to the electronic journals for which NAL purchases access. If NAL does not request the perpetual data rights to subscribed material, its access to the material it has purchased will end when the term of the subscription ends. Maintaining electronic copies by obtaining the perpetual data rights from publishers fulfils NAL's mandate to preserve our nation's agricultural literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">A second reason for acquiring perpetual data rights to the subscribed content is that NAL plans to load the data locally at NAL, in order to give researchers seamless access to the content through a single search platform. NAL hopes to make this change within the life of this contract. To accomplish this goal, NAL would request the subscribed content in XML (or some similar format) from the publisher and load it on NAL's servers. This transaction would occur on an ongoing basis, as new content was published. NAL can only acquire this data directly from the publisher; there are no resellers who can provide this data.</span></p>

<p>The solicitation number is FA8601-14-T-0057, the NAICS Code is 339113. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii).</p>
<p>The proposed sole source is Medtronic. The purchase is for Medtronic Longitude II Spinal system for inter-body lumbar surgery. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 339113 with a size standard of 500 people. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, any quotation received within three (3) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the Medtronic Longitude II Spinal System. This is the only known system allows the surgeon to access the patient's spine percutaneously, decreasing the amount of blood loss during the surgery and decreasing the likelihood that the patient would die from blood loss during surgery. The Neuro spine surgeon has trained using these Medtronic implants and plating systems and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost of approximately $40, 000. Medtronic is the only known source for this system as they are the original equipment manufacturer and only seller of their products.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Jason.hardman.4@us.af.mil or faxed to SrA Jason M. Hardman, AFLCMC/PZIOA, 937-656-1412 no later than 2:00pm Eastern Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) time on 18 December 2013. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-14-T-0057, Medtronic Longitude II Spinal System." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<p>Committee members are expected to: <br />&bull; Review documents as requested by the committee chairs and <br />&bull; Participate fully in the maintenance event.</p>
<p>Attendance in person at the maintenance event, which will be associated with the ACI Conference held April 29-May 1, 2014, is required by both committee chairs and committee members. Committee chairs only will receive an honorarium to compensate for time spent preparing and facilitating meetings. Honorarium will not be available for committee members.</p>

<a href="mailto:hunter.davenport@us.army.mil">MICC Center - Fort Sam Houston (JBSA)</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sam Houston Contracting Office on behalf of the Base Realignment and Closure Division, Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) intends to negotiate and award a logical follow-on to the Caretaker Support Services, at Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant (LSAAP) contract (W52P1J-09-E-0003 and Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) W52P1J-10-G-0003.  The authority cited is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 25(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  This follow-on contract will be issued to Day & Zimmermann (DZI) Lone Star LLC in order to provide Caretaker Support Services at LSAAP.  This requirement includes, but is not limited to: Government property accountability of the five(5) remaining Army retained parcels, facility maintenance, installation safety, compliance with environmental programs mandated by Federal and State agencies to include maintaining current permits and compliance with environmental closure requirements, and maintaining the High Explosive Demolition Ground, the High Explosive Burning Ground, the Area A Landfill, and the Old Boston Road Landfill.  <br>  <br> The Army transferred a major portion of the property to DZI Lone Star LLC and TexAmericas Center (Local Reuse Authority) effective 30 September 2010.  However, a caretaker contract continues to be necessary until the Army completes the environmental program compliance/remediation efforts and the disposal of the remaining Army retained parcels, which are estimated to occur at a currently undetermined date during or after the 2014 timeframe.  DZI is the incumbent GOCO facility contractor and caretaker contractor and has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain the services currently being performed.  It has been determined that awarding the Caretaker Support Contract follow-on to DZI is the best way to protect the Army's interest for the remaining parcels at LSAAP until such time as the remaining parcels at LSAAP can be transferred/conveyed.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition based on the following: <br>  <br> DZI is currently the named operator on the following environmental permits required at the plant.  Transferring the permits to a different operator would be costly and not likely to be accomplished within the required timeframe:  <br>  <br> Permit							Cost		Est. Timeframe <br> Resource, Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA)	$75,000	120-180 days <br> Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)			 $75,000	120 days <br>  <br> The anticipated period of performance is one base year of 12 months and two 6-month options.   <br>  <br> The NAICS code for this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, with a size standard of 500 employees.   <br>  <br> THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL and no solicitation will be issued.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting this requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by 27 December 2013, 4 pm CST, will be considered. The government does not intend to pay for information provided to the agency. All questions and/or responses must be directed to Andrea G. Palmer via email at andrea.g.palmer.civ@mail.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  <br>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2194<br />Name:		Pen, Ergonomic, Low Viscosity Ink, Retractable, Wide body, Black, 1mm<br />Description:	Wide body, 1mm point size, retractable ergonomic pen. Features low viscosity black ink that is water and smear resistant. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7520-00-NIB-2196<br />Name:		Pen, Ergonomic, Low Viscosity Ink, Retractable, Wide body, Blue, 1mm<br />Description:	Wide body, 1mm point size, retractable ergonomic pen. Features low viscosity blue ink that is water and smear resistant. UOI is EA.<br />Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-00-NIB-2194<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>NSN:			7520-00-NIB-2196<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 2, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in exploring new methods for analysis and decoding of neural signals in order to understand how neural stimulation could be applied to facilitate recovery of memory encoding following brain injury. Ultimately, it is desired to develop a prototype implantable neural device that enables recovery of memory in a human clinical population. Additionally, the program encompasses the development of quantitative models of complex, hierarchical memories and exploration of neurobiological and behavioral distinctions between memory function using the implantable device versus natural learning and training.<br /><br />SEE ATTACHED DARPA-SN-14-13.

<DESC>Background &lt;p&gt; The Solid Rocket Test Motor (SRTM) V-I1 will be tested on February 26, 2014 using the United Stated (US) Army Redstone Test Center (RTC) test stand in an attempt to concentrate slag build up in the aft dome test section.   This effort is conducted as a risk reduction activity involving a subscale solid rocket test motor to address specific, identified weakness in the fundamental understanding of SLS Program Block I Five-Segment Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (VRSRM) Polybenzimidazole Acrylonitrile Butadiene (PBI) material performance when exposed to pooling liquid alumina in contact with PBI insulation.  It has been proven to accommodate multiple test objectives and technical disciplines.  &lt;p&gt; The test motor article is a 24-inch diameter, 218-inch long solid rocket motor oriented in the vertical/nozzle down configuration.  The burn duration will be approximately 20 seconds and reach an internal pressure in excess of 600 psi, and has traditionally been fired horizontally; however, NASA is currently planning to test the article using a different orientation that is similar to a flight motor.  Orientation is important as it may impact placement of cameras, microphones, and any other types of instrument panels around the article.    &lt;p&gt; Information Sought &lt;p&gt; The purpose of this RFI is to inform the technical community of an opportunity to gain knowledge from the testing of the SRTMV-I1 motor in support of related inspection techniques, measurement methods, and analytical tools.	This opportunity is intended to address the identified need to support new technologies in their advancement to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  Specifically this opportunity is targeted for the TRL range from 3 to 6.	It is expected that vendors will not disrupt the test objectives of NASA, but NASA will allow vendors an opportunity to set up their equipment to gather data around the SRTMV-11 motor.  NASA will attempt to accommodate as many requests as practical, but it is expected the selectee number will not exceed five.  When responding, please include the following information: &lt;p&gt; 	Organization information: Organization name and address, type of organization, point of contact (POC), email address, and phone number.

<DESC>First we would like to thank all of our Industry Partners for their interest in our Navy Data Center Consolidation Way Ahead Industry Day on November 20, 2013.
As a follow up and part of our continued refinement to our Navy DCC Way Ahead strategy, the Data Center and Application Optimization (DCAO) office will be hosting One-on-One engagements with Industry. The intent of the engagements is to enable a more focused dialogue between the Navy and Industry partners regarding DCAO's proposed Tier structure that was presented during the Industry Day. This dialogue should include more specific information regarding capabilities or potential issues that Industry believes need to be addressed in any resultant RFP.
The primary week for the One-on-One engagements will be January 27-31, 2014. Each One-on-One engagement will be a maximum of 45 minutes and will be held in San Diego, CA at the Kros-Wise office located at 4250 Pacific Highway, Suite 205, San Diego, CA 92110. The Kros-Wise office is located across the street from the SPAWAR Headquarters, Old Town Campus and is being utilized to avoid visitor clearance issues for Industry partners.
Please contact Carmel Loomis at carmel.loomis.ctr@navy.mil to reserve a date and time. In addition, there are also a limited number of January timeslots prior to the week of One-on-Ones. These dates and times are intended to ensure all companies have an equal opportunity to meet with our team and will be booked on a first come first serve basis. If travel to San Diego is not possible, the DCAO office will make every attempt to accommodate other communication mechanisms such as VTC, GoTo meeting or teleconference. Please include the following information in your email request: company name, contact information, audio/visual needs and a primary and alternate date and time for your request.
NOTE: SPAWAR INTENDS TO UTILIZE CONTRACTORS IN SUPPORT OF THE ONE ON ONE MEETINGS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT IN THE EVALUATION OF THE INFORMATION PRESENTED.
By scheduling a One-on-One meeting, the Government will assume the respondent agrees to the participation of Kros-Wise Inc. as contractor support to DCAO.
Respondents that wish to execute Proprietary Data Protection Agreement (PDPA) and/or Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with Kros-Wise, Inc., must contact the company's POC below. Any PDPAs or NDAs must be completed and submitted to the POC below 3 days prior to the scheduled meeting date.

For the purposes of this RFQ, FDA defines compatible as meaning that there will be no communication, performance, maintainability issues in the interconnection of solutions with different configurations. A compatible solution is one that will allow for seamless (no application change) load balancing between sites including active/passive or active/active processing.</p>

<p>The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror as a fixed-price contract on the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation method. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price (inclusive of options) meeting or exceeding the non-cost factor (technical conformance to the requirements of the solicitation). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions. The offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the best interest of the Government; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

There are no exceptions or extensions to the required due date of responses.  There will not be a notice of award posted to this site.

Exception:  Section 508 standards are exempt and considered "back office" support services used only by service personnel for maintenance, repair, or similar purposes. The standards cover technology procured by Federal agencies under contract with a private entity, but apply only to those products directly relevant to the contract and its deliverables. An exception clarifies that the standards do not apply to technology that is incidental to a Federal contract. Thus, those products that are not specified as part of a contract with a Federal agency would not have to comply with the standards.

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
 The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> Synopsis: <br> 1.	CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract(s) is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide for the primary disciplines of Structural, Civil, Geotechnical, Hydraulic and Hydrologic, Mechanical, and Electrical engineering (each of equal priority); additional disciplines are Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Cost Engineering, Surveying, Cartography, and Specification Writing. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by July 2013. This announcement may result in up to four (4) awards and is restricted to Small Business firms.  If concurrent multiple contract awards are made, task orders will be allocated based upon the Contracting Officer's determination of performance; the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; the capacity of the firms to accomplish the work in the required time; and knowledge of the region.  In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms may be interviewed.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330 and the Small Business size standard is $14 million in average annual receipts. The period for this contract is five (5) years for a total IDIQ value not to exceed $9,000,000 per contract.   Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Work will be ordered by firm-fixed price task orders. The District intends to award two (2) IDIQ contracts, and may award two (2) additional contracts from this announcement.  The top ranked firm in the SF 330 evaluation will be requested to provide a firm fixed price proposal and may be awarded the first contract, if negotiations are completed; the second ranked firm to negotiate may be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate in order:  past performance; the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; the capacity of the firms to accomplish the work in the required time; and knowledge of the region.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act as determined by the employee's office location (not the location of the work).  Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract at the time of the original award and will become effective on the anniversary of the contract award date.   <br>  <br> 2.	PROJECT INFORMATION: A-E services are required for various civil works projects and support for other agencies.  The primary A-E service capabilities desired include the following types of projects and related skills and experience: <br>  <br> a.	Inland Marine Transportation System locks and dams, channel and harbor projects:  the rehabilitation of existing facilities and the design of new facilities.  The A-E must have competencies for design of both in-the-dry and in-the-wet construction methods, design for prefabricated and lift-in construction methods, analysis and design of hydraulic steel structures (to include expertise in fracture and fatigue design, detailing, and inspection), design of geared and hydraulic machinery systems, and design of electrical systems (to include PLC control systems.)  Expertise in MCACES cost estimating and SpecsIntact specifications related to inland marine transportation facilities is a requirement. <br> b.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to London.c.venzon@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance.

It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>*This Modification Number 1 is to extend the closing date of this Synopsis/ Solicitation Notice.  Quotes are due by 12:00pm (Noon) Central Time on Monday, January 13, 2014 in electronic format to the POC listed below.* <br>  <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This acquisition is under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island hereby request quotes for the establishment of one(1) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the Mobile Propane Tank and Pump Maintenance and Repair Statement of Work, dated 9 Dec 2013, as outlined in Attachment A.  This requirement is in support of the Rock Island Arsenal Logistics Readiness Center (LRC), at the Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-5000.  Quotes shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and conditions listed in Attachment B.  Only firm fixed price offers will be considered.    <br>    <br>  The contractors' place of maintenance and repair must be WITHIN 200 MILES of the Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-5000.  <br>    <br>  Prices shall be submitted using Attachment D, BPA Price Evaluation Sheet.  All prices quoted will be binding for the life of the BPA.  The proposed estimated labor hours and materials are for evaluation purposes only and are not a guarantee of the amount to be paid under this BPA.  The Government reserves the right to require the submission of any data (e.g. other than cost or pricing data) necessary to validate the reasonableness of a quote.  <br>    <br>  Award will be made to the responsive offeror that submits the lowest total evaluated price in response to Request for Quote (RFQ), W52P1J-14-Q-LE01.  The Total Evaluated Price will be computed by summing the Total Yearly Prices for each BPA Year.  The Total Yearly Prices are based on summing the total price for Labor and Materials plus Material Handling.  The total price for the Labor Cost is based on applying the estimated labor hours (80) by the proposed Fully Loaded Hourly Labor Rate.  The total Materials plus Material Handling is based on taking the estimated Materials ($3,500) times the material handling rate and summing materials plus material handling.  <br>    <br>  In order to be determined responsive, offerors must submit documentation that clearly demonstrates their capability to provide all of the services outlined in Attachment A, as well as, USDOT certification license listed with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  <br>    <br>  In addition, offerors are required to submit a signed copy of Attachment C, DFARS Clause 252.209-7994 with their quote to be considered for award.  <br>    <br>  The contractor must be registered in System Award Management (SAM) prior to award of this contract.  <br>    <br>  This RFQ is not funded; rather a blanket purchase agreement will be awarded for the Government to utilize when repair and/or maintenance of the propane tank and pump are required.  <br>    <br>  Quotes are due by 12:00pm (Noon) Central Time on Monday, December 16, 2013 in electronic format to the POC listed below.  <br>    <br>  Contracting Office:  <br>  Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI)  <br>  1 Rock Island Arsenal  <br>  RIA Garrison Installation Contracting  <br>  ATTN:  CCRC-IGB  <br>  Rock Island, IL  61299-8000  <br>    <br>  POC: Ms. Lynnette Eisenbacher, Contract Specialist  <br>  email: Lynnette.M.Eisenbacher.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Phone: (309) 782-5526

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: <br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management<br />Material Handling<br />Engineering<br />Quality Assurance<br />Security<br />Planning and Estimating<br />Housekeeping<br />Transportation/Drivers<br />Contract Administration<br />Testing<br /><br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's</p>
<p>(c) accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(d) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised</p>

<DESC>HVAC Chiller Overhaul
Salt Lake City VAMC
VA259-14-R-0062_1 Amendment

Questions and Answers:

The RFP states: 
"Service includes but limited to  refrigerant recovery/restoration, motor overhaul, compressor rebuild, inspection all gears and seals, replace #2 chiller oil pump (#1 replaced this year), install new bearings and shaft seals with factory OEM parts totaling 8 of each, evacuate and recharge, perform start-up and check for proper operation."   

1. Please clarify which bearings the VA wants replaced?   There are four (4) main bearings - low speed front and rear, high speed front and rear, thrust bearings high speed forward and reverse, low speed forward and reverse, plus high speed and low speed  thrust collars.  All of these are in the assembly requiring removal for the rebuild and may be out of York OEM specification. 

York has a bearing kit for overhauls, part # 664-48646-000. There also is another bearing that is not part of the kit that could be changed, High speed reverse thrust, Part # 029-20898-002.

2. Which seals and O-rings are to be replaced?  The count in the RFP suggests a total of eight (8) items with potentially four (4) being bearings and four (4) being seals or gaskets.  A minimum replacement for each chiller is one (1) gasket and six (6) O-rings along with the bearing count given above.

York has a gasket kit for overhauls # 664-48648-000. This kit includes all the gaskets and o-rings need to re-assemble the compressor.

3. What is meant by "rebuild" the motor?  Does the VA want the motor re-wound, new bearings installed, bushings replaced, dipped and baked, and then a spin balance performed?  Please clarify.

Visual inspection, disassemble, perform internal mechanical inspection and electrical test battery, steam clean parts and dry stator and rotor. Treat winding with insulation resin and cure. Assemble motor with new bearings and parts. Set-up and perform a no load, full voltage run test and record a three vector vibration analysis. Paint motor and precision balance the rotor assembly.

4. Does the VA want to convert the chiller refrigerant from R-22 to environmentally friendly R-134A or is that beyond the scope of this request for proposal?

Beyond the scope.

<DESC><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">16 December 2013 - Amendment 01 <br /><br /></span></strong>RFP FA8903-14-R-0004 - Fairchild PBR<br /><br />Subject RFP is amended as follows:<br /><br />Section J Attachment 1E2 - PWS Enclosure 2&nbsp;- Key Documents has been&nbsp;revised.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />No other revisions are made.&nbsp; <br /><br />The above amendment must be acknowledged per the instructions on Block 11 of the SF30.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>______________________________________________________________________________</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>5 December 2013 - SOLICITATION</strong><br /></span><br /><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION <br /></strong>The Request for Proposal (RFP) and all applicable documents for the Fairchild Air Force Base Performance Based Remediation (PBR) solicitation have been posted/uploaded onto the FEDBIZOPPS website.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Please note the following due dates: <br /></strong>Questions/Comments Due: 18 December 2013 <br />Proposal Due Date: 24 January 2014 by 1:00 PM CT<br /><br />NOTE: The Google document site may incur a potential lapse in service starting 8 Dec 2013.<br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED:</strong> <br />The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKS) at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) Lackland, TX, has been asked to provide environmental services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a PBR approach for SC involving remedial action efforts at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the POP in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. Reference the latest PWS dated 5 November 2013 and attachments posted to&nbsp;FedBizOpps for the latest documents.<br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:</strong> <br />The 772 ESS/PKS intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a FFP pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong>Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.<br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.
<p>Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $10M and $15M. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Christina Fernandez.<br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong>Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by date of award, the PCO will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong>The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.</p>
<strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong>An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirement requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Fairchild Air Force Base may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the <br />independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br />Note: CH2M HILL Constructors, Inc (CH2M HILL) has recently completed conducting investigations and/or focused remedial design pilot testing at two Fairchild Air Force Base Environmental Restoration Program sites under USACE contract W91238-06-D-0013. The two sites represent a significant part of the Fairchild Air Force Base PBR. The following documents have been delivered in draft form and will be posted to the RFP key documents site:
<p>i. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB, Site SS-39 Pre-Design Investigations.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB Site SS-39 Injection Summary.</p>
<p>However, for site SD-37 (which is included in subject contract and this PBR), CH2M HILL delivered an initial draft technical memorandum that is not sufficient for the Air Force to post at this time. We intend to post some of the associated data attachments to the CH2M HILL Technical Memorandum, Fairchild Air Force Base, Site SD-37 Datagap Investigation and Analysis, however, without the full context of the associated technical memorandum, this presents a conflict of interest where CH2M HILL has access to site investigation not available to other Offerors.<br /><br />CH2M HILL recently completed conducting optimization of&nbsp;Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 remedy under contract FA4890-06-D-0007-0001. As part of that optimization, CH2M HILL built and operated site Soil Vapor Extraction and In-Situ Chemical Oxidation remedy optimization components. CH2M HILL representatives have stated they have all of the actual construction and operational cost data associated with the remedy optimization components readily available, but have not provided the information in their draft report of the optimization effort. This detailed information will be needed for the Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 Proposed Plan and Record of Decision Amendment preparation, which is a required task of the PBR. This information has not been provided in a format readily available to other Offerors and therefore, potential Offerors will have to re-create by estimating all of the associated parameters and costs. Based on this, CH2M Hill has a conflict of interest because they have information that is not readily available to other Offerors.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY - SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT  <br>    <br> This notice is published in accordance with FAR 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information (RFI) only in support of a market research.  All information received will be used only for planning purposes.  It shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to respond, or to acquire any products or services.  Any response to this synopsis will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis to the Government for use of such information.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives or Performance Specifications.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  <br>    <br> The Army Contracting Command - Redstone, on behalf of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, hereby release this RFI to ascertain the level of interest of potential vendors desiring to contract for the development and production of an improved Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Missile (GMLRS) Launch Pod.  The Government's intent is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas.  Proprietary information is neither solicited nor prohibited; however, if submitted, it should be clearly and appropriately marked.    <br>    <br> A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort may be issued in the future.  The Government is seeking white papers regarding the technical approach to this technology concept and industry's assessment/opinion of the most efficient and cost effective method of executing this effort.  The response should include:    <br>    <br> 1.  A tier one schedule showing events from contract award to delivery of prototypes to the U.S. Government for material and combat developer evaluation.  <br>    <br> 2.  A cost estimate (MS Excel file) which includes personnel, hardware, and evaluation support   <br>    <br> 3.  A notional schedule showing events and rough order magnitude cost estimate for a maturation and risk reduction phase leading to a technology readiness level ready sufficient (TRL 6-7) for system integration and qualification.    <br>    <br> Industry is also encouraged to describe the benefits or risks associated with options and recommendations on contracting approaches that provide a best value to the Government while minimizing risk (especially cost risk) to the selected development contractor.  <br>    <br> DESIRED CAPABILITY IMPROVEMENTS  <br>    <br> The desired capability improvements in a next generation GMLRS Launch Pod are:    <br>    <br> 1.  The new GMLRS Launch Pod shall house six (6) GMLRS rockets.  The physical dimensions of the launch pod (i.e. height, width, length, weight), as well as the mechanical and electrical interfaces, must be compatible with the current M270 series, M142 launchers and existing logistical assets.

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

<DESC>This modification revises the Pre-Solicitation Notice of 28 Mar 2013 to correct the "Classification Code" from 61 to 59, change the Navy Sponsor POC and change the NAVSEA Security POC.  Therefore, the Pre-Solication Notice is restated in its entirety as follows:

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a small business set-aside competitive solicitation for the development of the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC).   This requirement also includes production of thirty-two (32) CAC units, 300,000 hours of engineering services and Orders.  The resultant contract will include development and four (4) option years for production and engineering services.  The CAC is one of many MIL-SPEC, environmentally qualified, water-cooled cabinets employed by the Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (A-RCI) Program to house submarine sonar acoustic processing capabilities on SSN 688, SSN 688I, and SSGN Class submarines.
  The CAC provides upgraded signal processing capability and is reconfigurable to support multiple acoustic and array sensors and will allow refreshes to mitigate obsolescence and/or incorporate Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) improvements. The CAC will implement Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  
NAVSEA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the late May 2013 or early June 2013 timeframe with proposal due approximately 60 days after RFP issued.  The RFP and related files will be listed under solicitation number N00024-13-R-6269 and will be issued electronically.  The solicitation will be made available only through the internet at:

	https://www.neco.navy.mil/ 	or 	http://www.fbo.gov/.
  

Offerors are hereby notified that from time to time, the Government may post additional information to either website relating to this solicitation (e.g. responses to questions, amendments, etc.). It is the Offerors responsibility to check the websites for any such information. 

The Navy has established an Electronic Technical Information Center (E-TIC) to serve as the repository for unclassified technical information related to the CAC Program.  The performance specification and other related controlled files will reside at the E-TIC.  The Classified information is available at the reading room located at SEA CORP in Newport, RI.  Information from Industry Day held on Dec 11, 2012 is available on the E-TIC.
  

In order to gain access to the unclassified E-TIC, Offerors must have a valid PKI certificate and be able to supply your Joint Certification Program (JCP) Certification JCP #________.  If the Offeror has a valid PKI certificate, access to the E-TIC is gained as follows:  First fill out an AIMTC Account Request form at the following link:  https://www.aimtc.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/aimtcmanagement/request.asp.  The following fields must be completed as follows:  the branch or Code you support is PMS401, the Navy Sponsor POC is Tim Nguyen, the Navy Sponsor Code is NUWC NPT Code 1533, the justification for your need to know is Prospective Offeror for the CAC Competition and check IQ9  A-RCI E-TIC as the area for which you have a need to know.
  When the request form is complete, hit the send button at the bottom of the page and you will be notified that the request is being processed.  An AIMTC User Account Information email will follow that provides you E-TIC login and password information.  

Companies/individuals who are interested in obtaining information from the classified reading room must submit a written request to the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Security POC, Tin Nguyen at 401-832-6195; fax number 401-832-4908, e-mail timothy.h.nguyen@navy.mil.  The written request must include data on the company facility and specific individual(s) requiring access as follows: facility security clearance level, issuing Government agency, and expiration date; facility security office phone/fax numbers; facility storage level, cage code, and complete destination address personnel for whom access to classified data is requested to include full name; security clearance level, issuing Government agency, and expiration date; date of birth; and city/state of birth.
  Once a prospective Offerors need-to-know and security clearance is verified, reading room details will be provided.

DFARS 252.204-70004, Alternate A, Central Contractor Registration applies.  Lack of current registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information may be obtained at www.ccr.gov.

Any firm lacking the requisite security clearance and intending to respond to this procurement shall, within ten (10) calendar days of issuance of the RFP, request initiation of such clearance action, in writing, from the Naval Sea Systems Command, Code:  SEA 00P3, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE Stop 1020, Washington, DC  20376-1020.  Appropriate clearance action in accordance with established procedures will be initiated by the Naval Sea Systems Command, but the Naval Sea Systems Command does not represent that such action can be completed and clearance granted prior to expiration of offers.
 

Once the RFP is issued, the Government will consider comments received.  The Government does not commit to providing response to any comments or questions.  All such questions should be received in writing within fourteen (14) calendar days after release of the RFP to allow the Navy adequate time to prepare and issue responses to all Offerors prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals.  Only questions transmitted electronically will receive a response.  The Navy will continue to accept questions up to the closing date and time of the solicitation; however, time may not permit responses to be issued prior to proposal receipt.  Questions received after the time set forth above will not result in an extension to the proposal due date.
  It is the Governments intention that questions and responses will be distributed electronically to all Offerors.  Each question shall include the document name, document date, specific page, paragraph, clause or other definitive citation requiring clarification.  The subsequent revision to any specification or RFP based on comments received remains solely at the Governments discretion.

The government will not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this synopsis or information provided as a result of this synopsis.  

This is not a request for proposal, a promise to issue a request for proposal, or a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.
  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in responding to this notice.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION	  <br>    <br>  1.0 CONTRACT INFORMATION  <br>  General.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6 and EP 715-1-7, Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE.  This acquisition will be used to procure highly specialized services required to provide continued Architect-Engineer (A-E) design services in support of the Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program.  The FRR program provides quick response to repair/renewal situations relating to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, instrumentation, communications, security, safety, systems, and cost, as well as environmental and hazardous materials abatement areas of Government facilities.  Sometimes the Government accomplishes the FRR projects through other design/build contracts; however, some projects will require that an AE prepare a design package (work plan) that will then be executed by a construction contractor under another solicitation.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Huntsville Center is one of the Army's leaders in studies as well as execution, and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide expertise and the highest quality research facility, life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other Federal agencies and foreign governments.  In order to accomplish this objective Huntsville Center proposes to award a Restricted Small Business Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). These awards will be ID/IQ contracts, with a one (1) year base and four (4) one (1) year options; Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated, with secondary criteria being used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. It is anticipated that this acquisition will result in award of a target of three (3) contracts, with the Government reserving the right to award more, less, or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Task orders (TO) will be awarded with FY13-17 funds, subject to the availability of funds, with a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 541310.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the Facility Repair and Renewal Program on A-E contracts are anticipated to total approximately $9,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.  This acquisition is a small business set-aside restricted competition.  Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and have the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.  In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor, the A-E Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract.

This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6 and EP 715-1-7, Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE.  This acquisition will be used to procure highly specialized services required to provide continued Architect-Engineer (A-E) design services in support of the Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program.  The FRR program provides quick response to repair/renewal situations relating to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, instrumentation, communications, security, safety, systems, and cost, as well as environmental and hazardous materials abatement areas of Government facilities.  Sometimes the Government accomplishes the FRR projects through other design/build contracts; however, some projects will require that an AE prepare a design package (work plan) that will then be executed by a construction contractor under another solicitation.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Huntsville Center is one of the Army's leaders in studies as well as execution, and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide expertise and the highest quality research facility, life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other Federal agencies and foreign governments.  In order to accomplish this objective Huntsville Center proposes to award a Restricted Small Business Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). These awards will be ID/IQ contracts, with a one (1) year base and four (4) one (1) year options; Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated, with secondary criteria being used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. It is anticipated that this acquisition will result in award of a target of three (3) contracts, with the Government reserving the right to award more, less, or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Task orders (TO) will be awarded with FY13-17 funds, subject to the availability of funds, with a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 541310.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the Facility Repair and Renewal Program on A-E contracts are anticipated to total approximately $9,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.

In addition, the cost of performing the work under this effort cannot be established in advance or be accurately forecasted so as to permit the undertaking of this requirement for a fixed price; therefore, a cost plus fixed fee (level of effort) contract type is recommended for some of the CLINs.&nbsp; The authority to award a contract using other than full and open competition is both: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (4).</span>

Contractors must have the professional qualifications necessary for <br> satisfactory performance of the required services. A complete design, including construction drawings, <br> specifications, a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and <br> cost estimates, construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a <br> design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and <br> maintenance manual may be developed for each project.

The A-E contracts are intended to  <br>  provide a variety of A-E services to include: studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations,  <br>  consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, plans and specifications, value  <br>  engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and  <br>  maintenance manuals, design analyses, specifications, cost estimates, parametric estimates, equipment and systems  <br>  commissioning and other related services. Contractors must have the professional qualifications necessary for  <br>  satisfactory performance of the required services. A complete design, including construction drawings,  <br>  specifications, a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and  <br>  cost estimates, construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a  <br>  design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and  <br>  maintenance manual may be developed for each project. In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the  <br>  Architect-Engineer Contractor, the A-E Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical  <br>  accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the  <br>  Contractor under this contract. The Contractor shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors  <br>  or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services.
