HHS requires the continued development and maintenance of it’s Continuity of Operation (COOP) plan in accordance with current federal guidance to provide for the continuation of HHS Headquarters (HQ) essential functions under all emergency conditions.

This includes the development of COOP facility preparedness.  The HHS HQ COOP will provide for the continuance of departmental essential functions within 12 hours and sustaining operations for up to 30 days or longer as the result of a catastrophic event or a national security emergency affecting the Washington, DC, metropolitan area.  The base year will run for twelve consecutive months from the date of award with four (4) twelve (12) month option periods.  Anticipated date of award is June 2004.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code is 541710, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation will be made available on or about May 10.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered for award.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available as the Federal Business Opportunities website provides downloading instructions.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled Knowledge Application Program (KAP).  The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment’s (CSAT) grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are designed to develop knowledge on best practices in substance abuse treatment.  In 1999, CSAT implemented a systematic program to synthesize, publish, and disseminate this knowledge to the substance abuse (SA) treatment and related fields.  Additionally, the Knowledge Application Program (KAP) has been responsible for production of CSAT’s premiere publication series, Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs). The current KAP has also been charged with considering the most effective formats for presenting TIPs to each of its intended audiences, and determining whether the specialized knowledge contained in the TIPs is actually reaching and being adopted by those most in need of that knowledge.  

The current KAP contract has begun to address the need for SA treatment knowledge to be synthesized and packaged in different ways depending on the target audience.  For example, new formats known as “collateral products” have been developed to supplement the standard TIP document in order to better meet the needs of some audiences. The existing KAP program was built on the following premises: 1) Treatment information needs to be presented to target audiences through a range of media and learning approaches including interactive workshops, Internet training courses and videos as well as the traditional training classes and written publications; and 2) To be most useful, information must be specifically tailored to the particular needs of specialized provider groups and must also be culturally relevant when appropriate.

The next generation of KAP must support the strong emphasis at SAMHSA on the Science to Services and Workforce Development initiatives. Successful implementation of the science to services cycle requires a strong monitoring and feedback component. Within the context of this requirement, offerors should demonstrate how they will promote SAMHSA's new focus on disseminating effective interventions rather than generating new ones, support performance monitoring systems, assess impact of fidelity vs. adaptation on outcomes of treatment provider use of both KAP and non-KAP products, and provide input to the scientific community regarding new research priorities and service gaps for the substance abuse treatment field. 

A DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Quality Assurance Surveillance will be posted on the FedBizOps.  The items are posted to obtain industry comments and industry standards, if applicable.  Industry comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Quality Assurance Surveillance should be sent directly to ltantard@samhsa.gov. Comments will be received until May 10, 2004.

The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is May 13, 2004 with proposal responses due June 14, 2004.  This solicitation may be obtained in any of four ways; by mail; picked up in person at 5515 Security Lane, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852; FedBizOps,or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http:/samhsa.gov/contracts.   Files will not be made available on the Web Site until after the estimated issuance date.  If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individual identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you, or check the Web Site regularly for amendments which will also be posted there.  Note: If you rely on the Web Site for obtaining amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assumes no responsibility for assuring you have downloaded these amendments.  Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement. This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by May 7, 2004.   The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to strengthen the competitiveness of rural enterprises in Bolivia’s coca growing regions of the Cochabamba Tropics (also known as “the Chapare”) and the Yungas of La Paz, Bolivia. 

USAID’s new, consolidated rural competitiveness activity will focus on helping remove policy, regulatory, institutional, on-farm, and market constraints to more efficient on and off-farm rural enterprises through a private sector-focused and market-led approach.  Strengthened competitiveness will be achieved by linking Chapare and Yungas value chains with emerging regional trade regimes and local markets, and helping to ensure that these value chains can produce according to the demand specifications of these markets.  Increased competitiveness of rural enterprises will lead to decreasing donor subsidies for these enterprises over the life of the activity.  Ultimately, USAID anticipates that this activity will help rural enterprises in coca growing areas to increase value, employment and incomes in a licit market economy.  With the contract to be awarded through the RFP anticipated herein, USAID is seeking to consolidate the Mission’s current basket of similar economic development activities currently carried out in two separate regions by different implementers, into one major rural competitiveness activity implemented by a lead contractor and any associated partners, across both regions.  

USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing RFP 511-04-018 o/a May 11, 2004.  Proposals due date will be approximately August 11, 2004.  Organizations interested in responding to the forthcoming RFP should consider participating in a pre-proposal conference scheduled to take place by approximately the end of June, 2004.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to issue a solicitation for audit recovery services to be provided on a global basis.  The resulting contracts are intended to meet the needs of the customer agencies (Federal Government) of FedSource,  an Interagency Service Provider, with nine regional offices.  Typical audit services will include telecommunications and accounts payable, but will not be limited to these audit recovery services.  The intent of the audits is to recover funds by analyzing billing errors (as represented by erroneous application of rates, tariffs, taxes, quantities, equipment inventories, circuits, special features, etc.).  A recovery fee percentage will be applied to any recovered funds the contractor is able to credit back to the customer agency.  The contractor shall be required to provide all management, supervision and labor to meet the requirements as issued through task orders.  On the basis of an unrestricted competition, the government intends to make multiple contract awards, which may be used by the nine FedSource offices through the issuance of individual task orders.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541219.  Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. If the Internet option is not available to you, you may receive a hard copy of the solicitation and any amendments (via U.S. Mail) by faxing your request to (304) 480-7203 or e-mailing your request to procurement@bpd.treas.gov.

This project is part of a multiphase construction project that will construct a new office, laboratory, and research campus for the FDA at White Oak.     The site, located one mile north on New Hampshire Avenue off the Capital Beltway, is the former US Navy facility at the Federal Research Center - Naval Ordinance Laboratory in White Oak, Silver Spring, MD.     Five phases are planned in total, with phasing summary as follows: Phase 1 - Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Laboratory Facility (111,250 gsf) completed in October 2003]; Phase 2 - Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Office Building (551,247 gsf); Phase 3 - Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Laboratory & Office (1,117,216 gsf); Phase 4 - Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Laboratory & Office (879,073 gsf); and Phase 5 - Office of Commissioner (OC) & Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Offices (455,796 gsf).     The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements. The contractor will perform the superstructure construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and terms and conditions of the contract.     The estimated construction cost range is between $30 - $40 million.     The 2002 NAICS Code is 236220.     The Construction Performance Period shall not exceed 600 calendar days.     Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.     The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire for the Naval Media Center in Annacostia Annex, D.C., Weekly Video Duplication and Distribution Services of its 30-minute news program, Navy/ Marine Corps News (NMCN).  This acquisition will proceed as a 100% Small Business Set-aside.  Duplication is required in various video formats and quantities each week, as customer needs fluctuate.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED to contractors within 40 miles (or a one-hour commute) of the Naval Media Center in Washington DC during normal workdays.  This commuting-distance restriction is necessary to permit the rapid replacement of video masters if found defective, and also to allow specific postal facility designations.  Current duplication calls for approx. 950-VHS dubs, 100-250 Standard 8mm dubs, and 5-ea. DVD copies each week.  Quantities of less than 10-each per week may be required in DVC-Pro, Mini-DV, DV-Cam, BetaCam-SP, and CDR formats. Turn-around requirement is next day.  Other formats are currently being considered and may eventually supersede the current formats.  The awardee will be required to provide the following: courier pickup of the program masters from Naval Media Center, Washington, D.C.; duplication from the NMCN video master; labeling of duplicates and insertion into the specified shipping container; printing  and insertion of a NMCN program highlight sheet into each shipping package; preparation and application of mailing labels to the shipping container; presorting of  packaged dubs for First Class USPS bulk mailing; transportation of the sorted dubs to the designated US Postal Service Processing & Distribution Center in Washington, D.C. for mailing, or to the U.S. Navy Postal Facility in Washington, D.C.  The cost of mailing will be paid by the government under a US Postal Service bulk mail permit.  In addition to the foregoing requirements, the awardee will also be required to occasionally supply ad hoc duplication of other 30-minute programming, on an as-needed basis.  It is estimated that ad hoc duplication represents less than 5% of the requirement.  The Government intends to award an initial 5-month base period, followed by four (4) one-year option periods and a final 7-month option period, with commencement of services to occur about 1 Aug 04.  This requirement is a small business set-aside.  Offers from large businesses will not be considered.  A firm’s current Small- or Large Business Status is determined through the SBA.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract as a result of the request for proposal (RFP).  Release of the RFP will be via the internet.  Interested parties may download the RFP upon its issuance from the following website:  www.neco.navy.mil.  If unable to access the website, interested parties may request a copy via email to joanne.reinert@navy.mil or telefax (215) 697-9742 attention Code 02P32E, Joanne Reinert.  Interested parties should frequently monitor the NECO website for any updates and/or amendments.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for architectural and engineering services and anticipates awarding two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts as a result of this synopsis.  It is anticipated that the maximum quantity required for each contract will be $500,000.  The minimum value the Government will be required to order will be $25,000 and no single order will have a fee in excess of $300,000.  The contractor will be required to provide multi-disciplined design work with an emphasis on the architectural and engineering disciplines.  Design skills must be demonstrated for the following building types: office buildings, industrial warehouses, and general laboratory space.  Typical architectural and engineering support may include the following types of efforts: (a) renovation and replacement of HVAC systems, re-design of water systems (internal to the building), installation and extension of sprinkler systems, installation of restrooms, and installation and retrofitting of elevators in existing buildings;  (b) modification of electrical systems and upgrading existing building power distribution systems;  (c) studies relating to code research, space planning, cost analysis, structural analysis and architectural evaluation;  (d) architectural and structural support services, which may include additions and/or significant renovation of existing spaces or buildings;  (e) demolition of buildings including removal of hazardous materials and assessment of environment concerns.  Asbestos and lead are know to be present, therefore the A&E firm shall identify and provide a design which will accommodate the disposal of these materials in the construction plans and specifications in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.  The first order to be placed under one of the two prospective contracts will be for a design to replace the accommodations for the activities in Building 125.  The replacement facility will be in Building A-59 where the acoustic tank  is currently.  The work involves the removal of the acoustic tank and the structure that houses it, along with the support utilities.  The hole will be filled and capped with concrete to form a smooth floor.  The work will require the removal of crane rails and the re-configuration of the wind bracing in three bays, re-routing the ductwork serving the south side of the Robotic Laboratory to clear the high bay space and the re-routing of the various utilities passing through the space.  Also a condensing unit will need to be moved.  The new space will have a 58’ by 20’ (approximate) high bay area and a two level office and support space.  The floor levels will align with the adjacent space known as CPF (to the north of the acoustic tank).  The new space will have connections to CPF on the first and second levels.  An elevator will be provided to serve both levels.  The high bay space will have a bridge crane (capacity of 3,500 pounds).  The high bay will have two 12’ by 12’ roll-up doors.  The first floor will extend into the hallway under the Robotic Laboratory.  The first floor area will have a raised floor for cable management.  New stairs will be provided.  Modification of the spaces in CPF will be required to allow for communication between the spaces.  All new spaces will have sprinklers.  Sprinklers will be supplied for the riser on the north side of the space.  The A&E will verify the capacity of the existing system. All hallway walls and conference walls will be from floor to true ceiling.  All other walls will be demountable.  Mechanical equipment will be housed on the third floor above CPF.  System furniture will be provided.  Provisions will be made for communication and data transfer.  The first delivery order under the second contract will be to provide design to construct a three-story addition on the east side of Building 207.  Building 207 is a three-story chemistry laboratory building.  The existing structure is set on piles.  The addition will be approximately 3,600 square feet with a footprint of twelve feet by one hundred feet.  The site for construction is very constricted. The construction of the addition will be architecturally similar to the existing building.  The existing windows shall be removed (where obstructed by the addition).  These window openings will be expanded to provide access to the offices.  The Live Floor Load shall be a minimum of 125 pounds per square foot.  The HVAC system serving the new offices shall be independent of the existing structure.  Data and communication conduits will be provided to each office.  Lighting levels shall be 100 foot-candles.  Remediation of hazards will be required for both projects.  The NRL will determine which effort will be assigned to either awardee, based on experience and qualifications.  Firms responding to this announcement must do so in accordance with the requirements set forth in Note 24 and the evaluation criteria listed at FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1, which are being presented below in descending order of importance: (1) The contractor shall provide specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical disciplines, and Elevators. This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. The A&E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required. Responding A/E firms must address both of the potential projects. (2) The contractor shall provide professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project.  Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members. If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment.  (3) Each contractor must also provide convincing evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (usually nine weeks for the average projects plus Government review time). It is very important to demonstrate the firms ability juggle workload and to manage a number of projects at one time, such as would be required in an IDIQ type contract environment. (4) The contractor must provide past performance information on contracts with Government agencies and private industry, which demonstrates cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Demonstrating this should include, at a minimum, things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, preferably IDIQ type contracts with multiple orders, the points of contact and phone numbers for references. (5) Contractors will also be evaluated on their location, which typically should be in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Contractors must be sure to include the location of each of the proposed subcontractors. (6) Contractors must provide the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (for the last twelve months).   Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement, and wish to be considered, must respond no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on the response date specified herein.  It is anticipated that the two IDIQ type contracts be awarded as a result of this synopsis will have a period of performance of 24-months from the date each contract is awarded.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541310.  All questions should be directed to the point of contact below.  All interested parties must send one copy of their SF-252 and SF-254, using the mailing address set forth herein, to Contracting Officer, ATTN: Code 3230.CB.

However, the Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s). The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s). The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards. Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factors 1 – Specialized Experience, 2 – Past Performance, and 3 – Engineering and Management Approach which are of equal importance to each other. Factor 4 – Price is slightly less important than any one of the other factors. When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3, when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4. The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if a price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government. Proposals shall be submitted in format as specified in solicitation Clause L-4, Proposal submission requirements. 
A pre-proposal conference will be held in conjunction with the site visit for the proposed Task Order 0001. Offerors are encouraged to participate in the conference/site visit.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is seeking to form a network to perform pilot clinical trials for neurological diseases.  Recent progress in neuroscience has led to an explosion in potential pharmacological interventions for neurological diseases that require testing in clinical trials. NINDS is supporting initiatives for drug screening and pre-clinical testing (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-02-139.html). However, many interventions may never reach early phase clinical trials. There are several barriers to entry for pilot clinical trials, including issues of competing interventions, infrastructure and funding, access to patient populations, lack of experienced clinical investigators, and inadequate communication between pre-clinical and clinical researchers. The goal of this project is to ensure that potential treatments are tested in pilot clinical trials in a timely and efficient way by developing a network of sites under a single operations center that could implement small scale trials for different neurological diseases. The trials conducted by this network would be studies that are needed to gain the information about the intervention (such as the dose, kinetics, route of administration, safety, and preliminary evidence of activity) needed to design a phase III trial. The proposed network will be a resource to test promising new agents that result from pre-clinical translational research efforts. 

The overall objective of the network is to facilitate the timely transition from pre-clinical to clinical studies.  Within the network, academic-based and practice-based centers could be pre-qualified, based on simple criteria, to be eligible to participate in pilot trials for one or more diseases.  The goal is to have broad participation and representation of different populations and diseases to limit the barriers for sites to enter the network.  New sites would be invited to apply to the network at regular intervals.  The contractor will maintain eligible sites that may then compete to participate in specific, fully funded studies as the need arises.  Each year, the network will potentially run two (2) or more concurrent pilot studies.  There will be a single operations center that will work with investigators to develop protocols, consent documents and case report forms, facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements, train and monitor study sites, perform data management and analysis, and coordinate all aspects of the network.  It is anticipated that the pilot studies will involve disease areas with little or no previous experience in clinical trials, requiring intellectual leadership – clinical and statistical – on the part of the operating center.  The selection of particular interventions for study will be performed by an external advisory committee comprised of NIH staff and scientists independent of the centers in the network.  The network will expedite clinical testing for select, high priority agents and provide clinical trials infrastructure where needed.  

It is anticipated that one performance based type contract will be made for a period of five (5) years in September 2004.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-04-05 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26. *****

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to be used in determining the state of technology and development requirements of an airborne antenna solution that will be required for the future JTRS Cluster 4 radios.  The Government is requesting information from companies working on low profile, low cost (including installation) airborne antenna systems that may be suitable for use with the future multiband, multichannel, multiwaveform JTRS Cluster 4 airborne communications terminals.  The Government is interested in receiving information from antenna systems vendors as well as key Industry members that could provide insight and recommendations as to the optimum implementation of a JTRS airborne antenna system. The optimum antenna system solution should minimize acquisition costs for the airborne platforms that will be installing the JTRS Cluster 4 radios. A low profile configuration should minimize the footprint of the antenna exterior to the aircraft and minimize fuel costs associated with aerodynamic drag presented by the antenna system.  Also, the optimum antenna-system solution would reduce co-site interference, mutual coupling, and enable reconfiguration and adaptive interference cancellation mechanisms.  This antenna system must enable connectivity for all three domains [Space, Airborne, and Ground] – A-S, A-A, A-G.

<DESC>The Department of Energy's (DOE) Solar Program and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are interested in the development and commercialization of parabolic trough solar power plant technology.  Based on recent due-diligence analysis, parabolic trough technology is viewed as an established technology with near-term market opportunities and has the potential for significant long-term cost reduction. NREL will be issuing a Letter of Interest (LOI) titled “USA Trough: Near-Term Component Manufacturing.” The broad objective of this LOI is to advance trough technology through improved domestic manufacturing of key parabolic trough components that are currently only available primarily from a limited number of foreign companies.  The United States is uniquely positioned to play a key role in the future development of trough technologies as a result of the experience and expertise gained at the current Solar Electric Generation System (SEGS) plants. The DOE and NREL are seeking to expand U.S. industry involvement and competitiveness in worldwide trough development activities and to help advance the state of parabolic trough technology from a U.S. knowledge base through its USA Trough Initiative. Currently, the USA Trough Initiative is concerned with cost-effective production of components or subsystems for large-scale (1 MWe and up), parabolic trough solar thermal electric power production plants.  This solicitation is intended to better position the offeror(s) to manufacture and sell parabolic trough solar thermal electric components and subsystems.  The following components are understood to be of high priority, but are not meant to be inclusive topics for this solicitation: glass or alternative reflector panels, receiver tubes, collector structure, collector heat transfer fluid interconnection (e.g. flexhoses, ball joint assemblies or alternatives), drive systems, and collector or field electronics or controls.  NREL anticipates multiple subcontract awards to be made prior to the end of the current fiscal year (September 30, 2004) based on current-year funding of $300,000; and projected funding of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.  Full text of the solicitation will be available on the NREL web site http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html on or after May 17, 2004. Telephone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals. It is anticipated that RFP-NHLBI-HR-05-05 for a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) will be available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/index.htm on or about May 14, 2004. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to establish a Clinical Network of ten clinical centers (CCs) and a CCC for the research of treatments for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). NHLBI will release separate Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the CCs and the CCC. The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials under multiple protocols for the prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS. The CCC will be responsible for coordination of all aspects of the ARDSNet, including development of standard operating procedures, coordination of all ARDSNet meetings and committees and development of public and private web sites. The CCC will have primary responsibility for the statistical design and analysis of trials, and for development and conduct of procedures for efficient, confidential automated data collection, entry, and sharing. Data collected will be in a format that allows easy uploading of data from the CCs to the CCC via internet if possible. The CCC will assist in the preparation of reports and manuscripts for publication of trial results. The ARDSNet will function with a Steering Committee (SC) of principal investigators from the CCs and the CCC, and a  representative of the NHLBI. The SC will collaboratively develop, prioritize, and conduct the clinical trials. Protocols developed by the ARDSNet will be reviewed by an independent Protocol Review Committee (PRC) chosen by and reporting to the NHLBI. Conduct of the trials will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) chosen by and reporting to the NHLBI. The CCs, each consisting of one or more participating ICUs, will enroll a total of 1650 subjects over five and one-half years of a seven-year project. The CCC will be responsible for the preparation and presentation of protocols to the PRC and interim data reports to the DSMB. Personnel should be experienced in biostatistics and the conduct of clinical trials in critically ill patients. The PI(s) of the CCC will provide leadership in statistical issues including the design of study protocols and analysis of study data. The CCC will be responsible for the design or selection, pre-testing and management of data collection tools, and ensuring confidentiality and quality control of data. The CCC will coordinate pre-testing of data collection systems and have responsibility for reproduction and dissemination of protocols, manuals, and forms. It will also coordinate training of CCC and CC staff in implementing protocols and entering data. Data collection is expected to involve the most modern techniques available that can be supported in intensive care units, in a format easily uploaded from the CCs to the CCC via the internet. A central data collection system that allows periodic download of data from remote sites is preferred.  The CCC will need personnel knowledgeable in the design and uses of decision support tools, and familiar with both bedside data collection systems and automatic downloading of data from laboratory systems. Although not required as part of a proposal, the CCC will be required to develop and submit an automated information systems security plan prior to contract award. The CCC will develop plans for randomization of patients, reporting of data to the DSMB, and analysis of data for preparing manuscripts for peer review. The CCC should be experienced in dealing with the Food and Drug Administration in obtaining approvals for new drugs and/or devices. The CCC will be responsible for arranging for drug blinding and drug distribution as necessary. The CCC will coordinate on-site reviews of patient records by a clinical nurse to validate the accuracy of data transmitted to the CCC.  The CCC will be responsible for monitoring development of informed consent statements. The CCC will coordinate communications among CCs and schedule conference calls and meetings of study committees as needed. The CCC will also organize meetings of the PRC and DSMB, and prepare statistical reports and minutes of these meetings. The PI(s) of the CCC will attend DSMB meetings to present data. The Government intends to award one contract for a period of seven years, on or about September 1, 2005.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for construction of paving an existing gravel roadway at the Federal Correctional Institution (F.C.I.) /Federal Prison Camp (F.P.C.) Oxford, Wisconsin.  The base project is to include the pavement of a roadway from the Federal Prison Camp service road which runs north and south to the powerhouse service road intersection (gravel road dimensions approximately 22 ft. in length x 1500 ft. in width).  The roadway will be shaped and gravel added to create a base approximately 6 inches thick and provide for a degree of cant to allow water run off.  The roadway will require an additional preventive measure to ensure no washout of the roadway during spring thaw in a location approximately 500 ft. from the south end of the roadway, this preventative measure will be discussed at the site visit for contractors to incorporate into their bids.  The base will be shaped, watered, compacted and covered with a 3 inch (hot mix) asphalt surface.  There will be seven alternates to this project.  The alternates will be awarded based on low bid price of the base project plus the individual totals of each alternate.  All, some, or no alternate may be awarded in conjunction with the base bid.  The priority of the alternates will be listed as follows:
Alternate #1: Pave the south parking lot located at the staff training center located on the north end of the federal property with dimensions approximately 60 ft. x 120 ft. to include the existing gravel roadway between the existing north parking lot and the south parking lot (approximately 22 ft.

Car stalls are to meet minimal standards for large vehicles (estimate width of stall to be between 9 and 10 ft.) and allow for consistency of stall pattern and conformity of stall numbers throughout the parking lot. 
Alternate #3: Cleaning and filling cracks of the F.C.I. outside perimeter road with a hot rubberized crack filler (similar material as used on standard public roads). The perimeter road is approximately 12 ft. x 4500 ft.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for preparing a telecom development policy for the Republic of Montenegro.

The Government of the Republic of Montenegro (GOM), which is one of two republics within the country of Serbia & Montenegro, has responsibility for telecom sector policy and regulations within its borders.  In the legal/regulatory area, Montenegro has had its own Law on Telecommunications since 2000.  The law prescribes the basic responsibilities for sector oversight on the part of the Ministry of Economy (MOE) of the GOM and established an independent regulatory body, the Telecommunications Agency of Montenegro.  

The proposed Technical Assistance will assist the MOE in carrying out one of its major responsibilities under the Law on Telecommunications, namely preparation of a telecommunications sector development plan; submission of this plan to the GOM; and oversight of the implementation of the plan once ratified.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $306,711 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), intends to award sole source contracts to the National Association of Social Workers, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association to continue providing comprehensive education and training to social workers (280-04-0120), psychologists (280-04-0121), and psychiatrists (280-04-0122) nationwide who directly care for, and support people affected by and living with, HIV/AIDS.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Each of these requirements is considered to be available from only one source because of the substantial lead time and effort required, and the unique, long-term relationships that must be forged with these professional populations in order to plan and conduct HIV/AIDS education and training activities.  As a result, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other sources would likely require a significant learning period resulting in an unacceptable probability of failure and resultant costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.

The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) will: (1) provide training to social workers serving populations increasingly affected by HIV/AIDS; (2) update and expand current NASW curricula materials; (3) provide technical assistance to the project’s social work trainers; (4) expand the number of expert trainers available to present content, and ensure quality of content of new and existing trainers; (5) provide oversight of Project by Advisory Committee; (6) provide technical assistance to social workers via a Website and update and expand current distance learning training program; and (7) participate in the evaluation component of the MHCPE Program.

The American Psychological Association will: (1) update and expand the HIV Office for Psychology Education (HOPE) Program training curricula; (2) provide training to psychologists; (3) provide technical assistance to HOPE Program trainers; (4) further develop and implement an Internet-based HIV/AIDS education program for psychologists; (5) train additional HOPE trainers; (6) train veteran HOPE Program trainers in the use of the CMHS Ethics and HIV/AIDS curriculum; and (7) participate in the evaluation component of the Mental Health Care Provider Education (MHCPE) Program.

The American Psychiatric Association will: (1) provide training to psychiatrists on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric dimensions of HIV disease; (2) provide training to residents and psychiatry medical students on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric dimensions of HIV disease; (3) provide technical assistance to trainers on an ongoing basis; (4) update existing training materials and develop new resources; (5) provide education/training opportunities for psychiatrists via the World Wide Web; and (6) participate in the evaluation component of the MHCPE Program.

The National Association of Social Workers, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association are the only known organizations capable of reaching the greatest number of social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists in the country and enlisting their support and participation for HIV/AIDS training and education.  They are the only known organizations that have the knowledge of, and credible access to, social work, psychology, and psychiatry faculty at graduate and professional schools and internship programs nationwide, and have the credentials for developing and accrediting graduate level education.  These organizations also have the relevant experience and capability to obtain the participation of social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists in rural areas of the country, as well as areas where HIV/AIDS training and education have not been conducted. 

Accordingly, it is the intent of SAMHSA to award a one (1)-year base, plus four (4) one (1)-year options, cost-reimbursement type contract to each of these organizations for the respective tasks above.  The estimated issue date of the Requests for Proposals (RFP's) is May 20, 2004, with the responses due 30 days later.  This synopsis of intent to award sole source contracts is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may submit Capability Statements.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to: Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Program Services, Division of Contracts Management, 5600 Fishers Lane, Parklawn Building, Room 13C-06, Rockville, MD 20857, Attn: Linda Tillery; or by facsimile to (301) 443-0019.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center intends to negotiate solely with PhotoTelesis Corporation (PhotoTelesis), 700 Lincoln Center, 7800 IH 10 West, San Antonio, Texas 78230-4753 for AN-PVH-1A and AN/PVH-2A Lightweight Video Reconnaissance S ystems (LVRS) Base Stations, Out Stations, warranties, parts and Time and Material repair services, Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), Engineering Support Services and Field Service Representative (FSR) support for the LVRS.  The Government intends to iss ue a 36 month Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for these items and services.  The LVRS provides near real-time images that can be used in conjunction with verbal and written reports from reconnaissance and surveillance elements.  The LVRS consists of two subsystems:  Out Stations (typically three each) and one Base station.  The Out-Stations are used to capture, compress and transmit individual daytime and nighttime still frame images over Tactical Communications systems to the Base Station .  The Base Station is located on a vehicle or at the company or battalion headquarters and receives, stores, decompresses, processes and retransmits video still frame images over Tactical Communications systems.  The LVRS reduces the time required to dete ct, process and provide targeting information to a Tactical Operations Center.    The LVRSs are National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (NITFS) Version 2.0, Level 3 certified systems that meet the Joint Technical Architecture-Army (JA-A) Version 6.5 requirements.  PhotoTelesis is the only known source that produces an end-to-end imaging system, such as an LVRS, that is compatible and interoperable with current fielded U.S.Army, Navy, Marine and Coalition equipment and is JTA-A Version 6.5 compliant. Award to any other source would require extensive development and testing effort which would result in duplication of costs and delay in delivery of the required items.    No hard copies of the RFP will be issued, therefore, no written, faxed or email requ ests for the solicitation will be accepted.  U.S.  Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center point of contact for this requirement is Mr. Jeff Pierce, contract specialist, 410-278-0861, fax:  410-278-0904, e-mail:  jeff.pierce@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Introduction:

The U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) collects detailed population and housing data to produce estimates of socioeconomic characteristics.  The data provided by the ACS throughout the decade corresponds to the data that the U.S. Census Bureau historically collected once every ten years during the decennial census. The Census Bureau began a full operational test of the ACS in four counties in October 1995 and added new counties each year through 2000.  Beginning in July 2004, we plan to expand the ACS by selecting an independent sample of approximately 240,000 addresses each month from all counties in the United States.  

Synopsis of Requirement:

The Census Bureau has a requirement for a contractor to use Census Bureau-provided rules to match approximately 240,000 sample addresses provided by the Census Bureau against the contractor=s address database to obtain a published telephone number for as many of the sample addresses as possible.  The contractor will be required to perform an exact match on basic street address, and, where present, on unit designation. The Census Bureau may require more than one contractor to match the same set of addresses because a second contractor may successfully match an address that the first contractor could not.  

The contractor will be required to provide the Census Bureau with a file in ASCII format of addresses (including ZIP+4) and matching current telephone numbers. The Census Bureau will determine the monthly file delivery schedule. 

Title 13 of the United States Code protects the confidentiality of the address information provided by the Census Bureau. Therefore, the contractor must perform the match in a pre-approved secured computer environment and return the original Census Bureau files. The contractor cannot retain a copy of the Census Bureau file or the information it contains. 

The solicitation is scheduled for release on May 14, 2004.  See the solicitation for further details, including additional IT security requirements.

<DESC>Jackson, Mississippi, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Courthouse, Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session.

On Tuesday May 4, 2004, the United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the construction phase of a new United States District Courthouse.  The Newworking Session will be conducted from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in Room 501B of The McCoy Federal Building, 100 West Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U. S. Court of Appeals, U.S. Magistrate Court, U.S.Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal Service, Circuit Library, U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Trustee, Congressional Offices, and GSA.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is $90,000,000 and most perspective General Contractors (GC's) are expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have expressed interest as the prospective GC's for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the prespective GC's to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.  Elements of the RFP will also be addressed for the perspective GC's at 1:00 pm.  Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractor/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA’s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Rebecca Vanover, GSA’s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Rebecca.Vanover@GSA.GOV.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is seeking to form a network to perform pilot clinical trials for neurological diseases.  Recent progress in neuroscience has led to an explosion in potential pharmacological interventions for neurological diseases that require testing in clinical trials. NINDS is supporting initiatives for drug screening and pre-clinical testing (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-02-139.html). However, many interventions may never reach early phase clinical trials. There are several barriers to entry for pilot clinical trials, including issues of competing interventions, infrastructure and funding, access to patient populations, lack of experienced clinical investigators, and inadequate communication between pre-clinical and clinical researchers. The goal of this project is to ensure that potential treatments are tested in pilot clinical trials in a timely and efficient way by developing a network of sites under a single operations center that could implement small scale trials for different neurological diseases. The trials conducted by this network would be studies that are needed to gain the information about the intervention (such as the dose, kinetics, route of administration, safety, and preliminary evidence of activity) needed to design a phase III trial. The proposed network will be a resource to test promising new agents that result from pre-clinical translational research efforts. 

The overall objective of the network is to facilitate the timely transition from pre-clinical to clinical studies.  Within the network, academic-based and practice-based centers could be pre-qualified, based on simple criteria, to be eligible to participate in pilot trials for one or more diseases.  The goal is to have broad participation and representation of different populations and diseases to limit the barriers for sites to enter the network.  New sites would be invited to apply to the network at regular intervals.  The contractor will maintain eligible sites that may then compete to participate in specific, fully funded studies as the need arises.  Each year, the network will potentially run two (2) or more concurrent pilot studies.  There will be a single operations center that will work with investigators to develop protocols, consent documents and case report forms, facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements, train and monitor study sites, perform data management and analysis, and coordinate all aspects of the network.  It is anticipated that the pilot studies will involve disease areas with little or no previous experience in clinical trials, requiring intellectual leadership – clinical and statistical – on the part of the operating center.  The selection of particular interventions for study will be performed by an external advisory committee comprised of NIH staff and scientists independent of the centers in the network.  The network will expedite clinical testing for select, high priority agents and provide clinical trials infrastructure where needed.  

It is anticipated that one performance based type contract will be made for a period of five (5) years in September 2004.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-04-05 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26. *****

An additional initiative, as requested by the Industry, for individual respondent information-gathering with Office Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, prior to release of any solicitation and prior to the Industry Forum, for all respondents, was instituted with the first meeting with a respondent on 23 April 2004.  The individual information-gathering meetings will be completed NLT 15 May 2004.

The making of a decision on the release of a solicitation remains unchanged.  The decision analysis of OSD to  release or not to release a solicitation as supported by the business case will begin immediately after the 15 May 2004 information-gathering meetings are completed and end NLT 30 May 2004.

The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) understands that it is essential for the scientific community to maintain clear lines of communication for thorough and well-reasoned science to be accomplished.  Support for conferences and workshops have proven to be an extremely valuable tool for DOD.  They allow technical managers the opportunity to receive prevailing information on their respective disciplines.  They also will allow AFRL/VS the opportunity to inform the scientific community of the current thrust of VS programs.  Conferences and workshops constitute a key forum for scientific and technology interchange.  AFRL/VS encourages proposals from recognized scientific, technical, or professional organizations that qualify for federal tax-exempt status.  AFRL/VS financial support through appropriate assistance instruments for conferences and workshops is dependent on the availability of funds, program manager’s discretion, and certain other restrictions.

The subject matter of the conference or workshop is scientific, technical, or involves professional issues that are relevant to the AFRL/VS mission for applied research and technology development programs relating to space systems and technology.

I.	Introduction

USAID/India is a full service mission staffed in FY 2004 with 16 USDH employees, 125 FSN employees, 10 U.S. Personal Services Contractor (USPSC) employees, two Technical Advisors for AIDS and Child Survival (TAACS) and one Fellow, supporting a bilateral assistance program (Development Assistance/Child Survival and Health and Economic Support Funds) of $86.2 million and $45.0 million in P.L. 480 Title II.  USAID/India is the field headquarters for the ANE Bureau's South Asia Regional Initiative (SARI) for regional energy cooperation and for equity issues (anti-trafficking of women and children).  The combined life-of-project funding for regionally obligated SARI DA and ESF funds is over $62 million for energy and equity programs in South Asia.  The Mission's new strategy with an approved budget of level of $993 million, covering the period FY 2003 through FY 2008, has five strategic objectives.  The FY 2003 Operating Expense budget level was $4.169 million.

USAID/India’s Office of Environment, Energy, and Enterprise (E3) encompasses a portfolio of activities valued at over $150 million and is responsible for planning and implementing the Mission’s strategic objective of “Improved Access to Clean Energy and Water in Selected States.”  These activities include projects to demonstrate best practices in power sector reform and water management; to enhance energy conservation and commercialization; to introduce clean coal technology and enhance thermal power plant efficiency; to introduce innovative clean energy technologies, including hydrogen, and to promote cleaner industrial technology and green businesses.  They are implemented via technical assistance and training partnerships through contracts and cooperative agreements, as well as participating agency services agreements (PASA) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


II. 	Role in the Organization:

The Senior Energy and Environment Advisor is a key member of the E3 Office and will have line responsibility in the Mission's organizational chart from which he/she will be expected to carry out the functions associated with the position of a USAID Advisor.  S/he will report to the Office Director (Direct-Hire) in the E3 Office of USAID/India.  S/he interacts with a wide network of partners among government institutions, development banks, other donors, state utility boards, private power companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the United States and India.  The Advisor’s responsibilities include policy dialogue at senior levels of the federal and state governments of India and coordination with senior USG officials from several domestic agencies working in India.  S/he develops programs with federal cabinet secretaries and joint secretaries, state governments and agency heads, bank and university presidents, directors of public utilities, and chief executive officers of major corporations.  In addition, s/he provides advice in the strategic planning effort for the U.S. Mission in the fields of energy, water and the environment.


III.	Major Duties and Responsibilities

The Advisor assists the E3 Office Director in managing the power sector distribution reforms, energy/water nexus, global climate change (GCC) and other related energy and environmental activities.  The Advisor is required to provide accurate and informed advice to Mission Management and key counterparts on the full range of energy and water sector issues, with particular emphasis on both policy reforms and implementation.  S/he requires a depth of expertise that enables her/him to provide leadership in these technical and policy reform areas to Mission Management, Foreign Service National (FSN) staff, partners and counterparts, and customers.  Key counterparts and customers look to the Advisor to present viable and relevant policy options to address the complex and often conflicting array of energy and water sector issues relevant to the Mission’s clean energy and water strategic objective.

The Advisor also:

&#9658;	Provides substantive conceptual and technical leadership in the design of new USAID programs in India’s energy and water sectors.

&#9658;	Provides technical leadership to USAID’s program in support of developing the hydrogen energy economy in India.

&#9658;	Ensures the acceptable performance and completion of contract scopes of work (SOWs), terms of reference (TORs), work plans, delivery orders, budgets, and specifications by short- and long-term technical advisors as well as by institutional contractors.  Periodically visits project sites and writes reports with observations and recommendations.

&#9658;	Represents USAID/India as a featured speaker in national and international workshops, conferences and seminars.

<DESC>USSOCOM  is searching for sources to provide a multi-mission autonomous underwater vehicle for deployment from SOF and Navy maritime platforms.   The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in cooperation with the US Navy intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to qualify or adapt a non-developmental (commercial-off-the-shelf) Multi-Mission AUV for use on mission on SOF and littoral Navy mission. The mutli-mission AUV should have the following characteristics:  (1) Mission Module Volume:  The MM-AUV must have adequate volume and structure to support (fit) multiple mission packages.  The first mission packages must include a high (3-D) resolution sensor + survey package. The MM-AUV must be able to accommodate (fit) a mission module with a volume of at least 7 square feet.  (2) Littoral Operations/AUV Draft:  The MM-AUV must operate in littoral waters to depths of at least 500 meters and have a minimum draft not exceeding 1 meter allowing for operations in extremely shallow waters. (3) Complexity / Operations / Relialbity Availablity and Maintainabilty (RAM):  The Multi-Mission AUV must be readily programmable by Navy ship personnel.  The Mission planning / programmaing module should interface with commercial computer (and operating systems).  The training required to instruct military personnel to program (mission plan) the AUV should not exceed 1 month of classroom and practice training. Specialized MM-AUV maintenance training should not exceed 2 months of training.  The AUV should include "swappable" parts/sub-systems allowing for reduced system downtime during operations. (4) Deployment and Recovery:   The design should afford stability to provide launch and recovery in most sea-states, from multiple platofrms by existing shipboard cranes/equipment. At conclusion of a mission, the Multi-Mission AUV must actually surface in a pre-programmed location not greater than 150 meters from pre-programmed location.  At launch and upon surfacing, the Multi-Mission AUV must provide a wireless control package to steer the AUV to the recover ship's.  (5) Endurance / Range:  The Multi-Mission AUV must have a range of at least 36 nautical miles.  Responses to this market survey are due on or before 14 May 2004, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  Submit vendor data information, firm address, POC, phone/fax numbers, and email address to: Naval Undersea Warfare Cenetr Division Newport, Attn: Mark Minucci, (401) 832-8545 or email  minuccims@npt.nuwc.navy.mil  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

BACKGROUND:  

The Inspector General Department of Defense (IG DoD) is currently implementing a long-range strategy to conduct audits of DoD financial statements. The Chief Financial Officer’s Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576) requires that agencies prepare annual financial statements, and the IG DoD audit the agency prepared financial statements. For a sample of IG DoD financial statement reports, go to http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/03report.htm and select reports D-2003-050, D-2003-047, D-2003-042.

The Department’s financial statements must cover all accounts and associated activities of each office, bureau, and activity of each component within the DoD.  The IG DoD must verify the reliability of agency financial statements through the use of audits and other methods.  Currently, the Department’s financial statements are being developed using various financial management systems throughout the DoD.  The reliability of these systems directly impacts the DoD’s ability to produce reliable financial statements.  

The IG DoD is committed to increasing the resources devoted to auditing the financial statements, and the related financial management business activities.  The IG DoD’s strategy is intended to facilitate the Department’s commitment to improve financial management and attain auditable financial statements that support an unqualified opinion.  To accomplish this strategy, NAVAIR AD intends to develop commercial contract sources to perform assessments of DoD financial management business activities and practices.  

SERVICES REQUIRED: 

Reliability Assessments of DoD Financial Operations 

Sources are sought to conduct reliability assessments of individual DoD Components involving their financial related operations, activities, functions, and processes, used to compile and prepare the DoD's financial statements.  The assessments will also determine whether internal controls over financial reporting are in place and operating as intended.  

Examples of the DoD Components that may require an assessment include but not limited to:
- Army General Fund
- Army Working Capital Fund
- Navy General Fund
- Navy Working Capital Fund
- Air Force General Fund
- Air Force Working Capital Fund

A reliability assessment is a preliminary evaluation to determine if an entity’s financial statements can withstand a full-scale audit and a means by which to identify significant issues, if any, that may preclude the performance of a full-scale financial statement audit.  The specific services required for each type of assessment will be reflected in individual statements of work for each task order.

A performance work statement will be developed on a case-by-case basis describing the technical requirements, and functional performance requirements and the nature and type of service(s) needed.

The reliability assessments must conform to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) [http://www.gao.gov/govaud/yb2003.pdf] and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards.  The IG DoD will monitor the contractor’s work in accordance with the General Accounting Office (GAO)/President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM), Section 650, "Using the Work of Others."  Specifically, the IG DoD will determine whether the contractor's work complies with GAGAS and AICPA standards through the use of periodic contractor reporting and ongoing access to contractor’s working papers.  The IG DoD will also ensure that the work supports the reliability assessment conclusions.   The IG DoD will issue task order contracts with variable performance timeframes for each order.  It is envisioned that IPA with IG DoD oversight will primarily conduct the reliability assessments.  

Contract Objective(s).  The overall program objective is to determine whether various DoD financial statements, taken as a whole, are accurately presented in all material respects, and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  The objective(s) of individually awarded task orders will be to determine the accuracy and reliability of the DoD Components Financial Management Systems, processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of agency financial statements.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

An interested party should be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, experience with evaluating Government financial and financial related operations including financial management systems, processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of an agencies financial statements.  NAVAIR-AD intends to award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required. Experience may include, both government and commercial work that the offeror has performed.  Demonstrated evidence may include, but not be limited to customer names and addresses, description of work performed/delivered, description of types/complexity of systems worked on, description of strategies to accomplish the work, description of communication strategies with the customer, and significant accounting and information technology issues resolved.  If applicable, highlight any Government financial and financial related work performed (include contract numbers).  Interested parties should be able to demonstrate their ability to perform these evaluations with only personnel that are U.S. citizens.  Finally, offerors should include an analytical comparison of their capability in terms of the services requested by this RFI.   

RESPONSES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SHOULD CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1) A 3-5 page summary of the contractor’s “relevant” prior work; 2) description of any potential conflicts of interest the offeror may have in performing the work, 3) A brief description of the contractor’s quality control processes for deliverables; 4) references (names and contact information) for whom the contractor has performed similar work, 5) a one-page corporate summary including your web site, 6) a listing of any current negotiated GSA schedule, government contract, or commercial pricing rates, and 7) a statement identifying if the offeror is a small business, 8(a) firm, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, or HUBZone firm.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes." It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time.  SDO is the first mission under the Living With a Star (LWS) program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection. SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA's understanding of the solar process and space weather. SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees. SDO will have a mission life of 5 years.  NASA/GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) project. The present requirements are specified in the attached documents:  Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work - Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies 464-MECSM-LEGL-0028 Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification - Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies 464- MECSM-SPEC-0036 This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work and Specification via the internet, and solicit input and recommendations from interested parties. The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA/GSFC's knowledge of industry's capabilities. NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project. This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202. The intent of the sessions is to provide a dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA/GSFC's requirements and its acquisition approach. The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1) and Performance Specification (Exhibit 2).  Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes 1. Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW. Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comments that either describe how a potential offeror's actuator could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror's position on such a requirement. This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions. It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable, 2. Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule, and 3. Summary of past relevant experience in developing propellant tanks.  This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Waveguide Rotary Joint Assemblies requirement that will be furnished at this time.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to this 541990 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. 

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. 

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and must respond to the following questions: (1) Does your firm qualify as a small business under the NAICS code? (2) Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business under the NAICS code? (3) If disadvantaged, under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  (4) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm?  (5) Are you considered a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned business?  In addition, the respondent must provide a capability statement that addresses the organization’s qualifications and ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.

The Office of Applied Studies (OAS) was established in October 1992, when the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) was reorganized as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  OAS serves as SAMHSA’s focal point for data collection analysis and dissemination activities.  Data are collected on the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse, as well as on the adverse health consequences associated with substance abuse.  OAS also collects data on the nation’s substance abuse treatment system and on the characteristics of individuals receiving substance abuse treatment.  These data are intended to serve as statistical indicators of progress in the field and to enable a better understanding of the nature and extent of substance abuse, in order to improve prevention and treatment services and to reduce substance abuse and mental illness.

In addition to discrete studies, OAS maintains several major data systems:

(1) National Survey On Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); (2) Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN); and (3) Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS), which includes the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and the Treatment Episode Data System (TEDS).

Each of these data systems routinely generates new data sets.  However, internal SAMHSA resources devoted to analytic work are sufficiently scarce that external assistance in analysis and dissemination must be sought.  For example, the NSDUH (funded under a separate contract) produces routine estimates of drug use nationwide, at the state level, and for various sub-populations.  Nevertheless, the vast array of data collected during that survey cannot all be analyzed under the primary contract, nor are there sufficient in-house resources available to mine the data sets assembled under that activity.  Therefore, external assistance to produce reports highlighting more focused concerns (e.g., drug use by women or adolescent females) is highly desirable.

<CONTACT>Tina Phillips, Contract Specialist, Phone (610)595-0643, Fax (610)595-0671, Email marie.phillips@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM 254 AND STANDARD FORM 255 IS CONTAINED HEREIN.
Engineering and design services are required for four indefinite quantity contracts for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the states of DE, PA, MD, VA, NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI, NH, ME, AND VT. 

One firm for each contract will be selected for the following contracts:  
Contract N62472-04-R-1430 will be used primarily for work in ME, NH and VT.  
Contract N62472-04-R-1431 will be used primarily for work in CT and RI.  
Contract N62472-04-R-1432 will be used primarily for work in NY and NJ.  
Contract N62472-04-R-1433 will be used primarily for work in PA, and DE.
However, work from other geographical areas may be added to any contract at the discretion of the Government. 

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $1 - $8M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of housing, barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% to 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project for each contract will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to these contracts may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 to 35%, 35 to 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of each contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the Success estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. 

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Oralee Martin, Contract Specialist, 619-553-5347
<DESC>PEO C4I is seeking information pertaining to GPS Anti-Jam Antenna Technology that is applicable for near term use on US Navy submarines.  The Navy is considering plans for upgrading the existing GPS antennae currently deployed on US Navy submarines in the following antenna masts: OE-538/BRC, Type 18I periscope and AN/BVS-1 Photonics masts.  NAICS code is 334220. Non-developmental or COTS solutions are preferred.  The performance of the antenna must at a minimum be consistent with the existing GPS antennae (minimum gain of -3.5 dBiC to RHCP signal over a 160 degree solid angle cone for L1 and L2).  Protection for both L1 and L2 frequencies simultaneously is desired.  The antenna and its associated electronics must fit into the existing antenna and antenna electronics spaces for each respective mast.  The final output of any proposed anti-jam antenna technology must be compatible with the input to an AE-4 or the GPS VME Receiver Card (GVRC).  The physical envelope for each specific mast can be found in Appendix A (Antenna Characteristics Matrix). Appendix A can be obtained from the POC listed at the end of this RFI.  If any additional electronics are required, they will be installed inboard and size should be no more than 100 cubic inches.  The antenna/electronics must operate via a single RF connection (TNC) that is compatible with the existing GPS receiver systems in order to minimize the impact on the existing mast configuration.  In this way the Navy utilizes an already developed, qualified submarine antenna mast and radome with established logistics support in place.  Consideration should also be given to non-AJ antenna solutions that can protect against continuous wave and broadband jammers. Offerors should be prepared to state proposed solution for readiness for technical sample testing.  Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capabilities (SOC) including a technical description of the antenna system sufficient for government evaluation.  Interested offerors must submit an SOC that clearly shows they are qualified to perform the effort and include (1) physical and functional description of the item being offered (size, weight, and external interfaces); (2) performance specifications of the item; and (3) qualification data (if available). This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued.  It is not the intent of PEO C4I to reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI. In addition, there will be an industry/technology day associated with this RFI on June 2, 2004 at PEO C4I, San Diego. Please direct any questions via e-mail to the POC as follows: PEO C4I POC: Melissa Lagerquist at Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PMW/A 156-91, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego CA 92110-3127.  Email: melissa.lagerquist@navy.mil.  Phone: 619-524-2764 INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD SUBMIT ANY APPLICABLE INFORMATION BY 3:00 PM PST ON MAY 26, 2004 VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OR VIA TWO (2) COMPLETE SETS OF HARD COPY MATERIALS TO THE PEO C4I POC ABO

<DESC>This special notice replaces Soliciation Number DOI-SNOTE-040426-001 (ANN04000133).  This notice was re-issued to change the response date to 5/17/2004. The United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) solicits your qualifications for providing investment advice and consultation services for a Trust Fund for the People of the Federated States of Micronesia and a Trust Fund for the People of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.   BACKGROUND Public Law 108-188 authorizes the creation of the two trust funds.  Over the twenty years through 2023, Government of the United States will contribute $442 million to the trust fund for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and $235 million to the trust fund for the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI).  The RMI will contribute $25 million as soon as its trust fund is established and $2.5 million in each of the two subsequent years; the FSM will contribute $30 million by the end of this fiscal year (before October 1, 2004).  Income will accumulate through the end of 2023.  It is anticipated that $46 million will be available in fiscal year 2004 for the FSM trust fund, and $32 million for the RMI trust fund.  After 2023, the income will aid in supporting the governmental activities of the FSM and the RMI.  These activities are described in section 211 of the Compact of Free Association, as amended, relating to the FSM and section 211 of the Compact of Free Association, as  amended relating to the RMI.   Both amended compacts were approved in United States Public Law 108-188.  For salient details please read the trust fund subsidiary agreements noted below and available on the web site of the Office of Insular Affairs (see URL citation below). The two trust funds will be incorporated separately in Washington, D.C. in the very near future. This RFI is intended to jump start the investment process.

<SUBJECT>A--PERSONNEL SECURITY THESIS, DISSERTATION, AND INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AWARDS
<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION: Document Type: 		Presolicitation Notice 	Solicitation Number: 	BAA 04-01-MT-FH 	Original Response Date:	30 September 2004 	Current Response Date:	30 September 2004 	Archive Date:		30 September 2004 	Classification Code:		A - Research & Development CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: 	Department of the Interior 	National Business Center 	Acquisition & Property Management Division, Southwest Branch 	PO Box 12924 	Bldg 22208 Augur Avenue 	Fort Huachuca, Arizona  85670-2924 DESCRIPTION:  Personnel Security Thesis, Dissertation, and Institutional Research Awards, Solicitation (SOL) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA 04-01-MT-FH), Proposals Due: From solicitation publication through 4:00 PM (MST), 30 September 2008. POC: Ms Gloria Golden, DOI/NBC Fort Huachuca, voice: 520.538.0418, email: Gloria_M_Golden@nbc.gov or Mr. Lawrence H. Carter, DOI/NBC Fort Huachuca, voice: 520.533.1213, fax: 520.533.8954, email: Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition & Property Management Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting as the contracting agent for the Personnel Security Research Center (PERSEREC), is issuing a BAA to solicit research proposals addressing issues pertinent to personnel security policy. Multiple acquisition awards are anticipated with typical periods of performance of 12 months including final reports and/or demonstrations. Information in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria available on-line at http://www.nbc.gov/persecbaa.cfm. The PIP may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or official mail. Send requests for PIP to the Department of Interior, Fort Huachuca by email to Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov or call 520.533.1213. TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH AREAS: The technical areas include financial and credit, candidate screening and crime detection procedures, prescreening, background investigation, adjudication, continuing evaluation, employee assistance programs, security awareness, and security education. By providing financial support for master's thesis, doctoral dissertations and institutional research, PERSEREC intends to respond to needs identified by the industrial and personnel security research communities and to reiterate the Department of Defense's (DoD) commitment to fostering innovation within the field of personnel security. There are four (4) research areas involved in this solicitation: (1) Vetting Systems; (2) Continuing Evaluation; (3) Automated Systems for Personnel Security; and (4) Trust Betrayal. A brief description of each research area is as follows: Vetting Systems: DoD personnel security vetting systems have three principle components: prescreening, a background investigation, and an adjudication that determines an individual's eligibility for a particular position. A variety of policies and procedures exist in DoD to vet individuals for employment suitability, access to classified information, suitability for other positions of trust, and reliability for handling nuclear material for weapons. Our research in this area aims to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and fairness of these personnel security vetting systems. Continuing Evaluation: This area involves research aimed at helping to ensure the continued reliability, trustworthiness and loyalty of cleared personnel. We hope to systematically examine and improve three key post-vetting functions of personnel security systems: monitoring or continuing evaluation, security education, and intervention and employee assistance. Mentoring or continuing evaluation includes the reporting of information that may bear on an individual's continued eligibility to hold a clearance or have access to privileged information. Security education focuses on enhancing in the minds of trusted employees an awareness of the threat and of human and technical vulnerabilities to adversaries. Finally, intervention and employee assistance looks at how security programs can help cleared individuals with personal problems, seek assistance, and thereby maintain their security clearance eligibility. Automated Systems for Personnel Security: The primary aim of research in this area is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the investigative process by developing systems that electronically acquire and analyze relevant investigative data from commercial and government databases. Research that would help design or develop systems to detect and deter financial irresponsible or illegal activity is of interest. Research pertinent to automated systems that incorporate other types of individual data useful for continuing evaluation and counterintelligence purposes would also be helpful. Trust Betrayal: The research in this area is focused on understanding the phenomenon of trust betrayal, particularly espionage. There has been no shortage of journalistic and biographic writing about individual American spies and their stories. However, there is a continuing need to put this data together into an organized framework so that we can generate comparative analyses and arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of espionage and other forms of trust betrayal. This should yield information useful to security and counterintelligence policymakers as well as those responsible for security and threat awareness training and education. A recent emphasis in trust betrayal research is a focus on ensuring the continued reliability of IT personnel entrusted with the administration and control of Defense information systems. These personnel may or may not have access to classified information, but have the potential for rendering our operational systems, and the sensitive information they contain, vulnerable to adversarial interests. PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to pay for proposal preparation costs. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or to any other contract. However, it may be an allowable expense to normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government. Any responsible offeror considering itself capable of satisfying the needs identified in this BAA may submit a proposal. Further, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or servable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. This BAA will remain open through 30 September 2008 for the purposes of receiving proposals. In order to be considered for an award, proposals must be received by the Department of Interior at the Administrative Address identified below on or before 30 September 2008.

<DESC>The  USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate solely with Leica Microsystems, Inc. in Exton, PA; to purchase a complete incubation and temperature regulation system for use with a Leica Model DM IRBE optical microscope, operated as a confocal microscope system.  Accessories for Confocal Microscope consists of:  1) Incubation system, complete:  Environmental control system for microscopic specimen especially living cells or tissue sections.  For all DM IR inverted microscopes:  Includes miniature-incubation chamber with air control, control unit for temperature and CO2, heating insert p for petri-dishes or Bachofer perfusion chambers and temperature.  Installation is included;   2) Bacofer Perfusion:  Set for open and closed perfusion.  Perfusor not included.  Modified for TCS z-stages;  3)  Objective heater d=30,5mm:  Heater for objectives with diameter 30.5mm;  4)  Temcontrol Mini for Objective heater:  Temperature regulator for objective heater (156108376); for the Core Technologies Group in Wyndmoor, PA 19038.  The capabilities of the microscope system, together with the availability of a large selection of fluorochromes as functional indicators, provide an important resource for pursuing scientific goals of some ARS national research programs.  Many other experimental materials researched at ERRC, take advantage of the special capabilities of the confocal microscope system, but it is important to add an accessory incubation system to control the temperature and micro-environment of samples that are studied with the microscope.  An incubation system, designed and manufactured for the TCS-SP microscope, that provides temperature regulation and perfusion capabilities is a necessary component for sophisticated control of sample conditions on the the experimental stage.  Other current research projects benefiting potentially from micro-environmental control and the confocal microscope system represent all Research Units at ERRC.  This is not a request for proposal.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Companies with the demonstrated capability of providing this equipment must submit a descriptive statement, including descriptive literature, specifically addressing the equipment=s component=s and availability.  The statement and literature must be submitted to the Contracting Office Address within 5 days of publication of this notice The items to be furnished shall be labeled with the purchase order number and delivered, all transportation charges paid by the Contractor in accordance with the F.O.B. Destination Clause to USDA, ARS, Eastern Regional Research Center.

solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not 
be issued.  Solicitation N00421-04-R-0060 is being issued as a Request for 
Proposal.  This solicitation incorporates clauses and provisions in effect 
through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20 and DCN 20040223 Edition.  This 
requirement is not set aside for small business.  The applicable North American 
Industry Classification System code is 334119, and the small business size 
standard is 1000 employees.  Offerors must be registered in the Central 
Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to submission of an offer to be 
considered for award of any DOD contract.  This may be accomplished 
electronically at http://www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.
The government intends to solicit and negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with Belobox Networks, Inc. or its authorized distributors 
under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Belobox Networks, Inc. equipment is completely interchangeable and interoperable with existing equipment.  This notice is not a request for full and open competitive proposals.  However; interested parties may submit a capabilities statement in which they identify their interest and capability.  
All capability statements received by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time March 22,
2004, will be considered by the government solely for the purpose of determining 
whether to initiate a full and open competitive procurement.  Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the offeror to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on an other than full and open competitive basis based upon responses received.  The Government will not pay for any information received.

52.211-8 -- Time of Delivery.
As prescribed in 11.404(a)(2), insert the following clause:
Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)
(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE
Requirement is for a total of one hundred sixty nine (169) vehicles, which includes one hundred twenty six midsize (five passenger capable) sedan cars, forty five (45) mini-vans, and eight (8) compact pickups between the inclusive dates of 24 May and 26 June 2004, a short-term rental period of varying delivery and pickup times.  All 169 vehicles will be delivered to and picked up by the contractor at the same address, 321 Cullen Street, Shaw AFB SC.
ITEM NO.	QUANTITY	ON OR BEFORE
Midsize rental cars 	1	24 May 04
Midsize rental cars 	1	26 May 04
Mini-vans	        5	26 May 04
Midsize rental cars	19	31 May 04
Mini-vans 	        38	31 May 04

Compact Pickup Trucks 	8	7 June 04
Midsize rental cars	20	7 June 04
Mini-vans	        2	7 June 04
The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.
OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE
ITEM NO.	QUANTITY	ON OR BEFORE
		
		
		
		
(b) The delivery dates or specific periods above are based on the assumption that the Government will make award by 20 May 2004. Each delivery date in the delivery schedule above will be extended by the number of calendar days after the above date that the contract is in fact awarded. Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.

<DESC>Voucher Clarification: 


QUESTION:  I calculate a Total of 84 students taking the three courses.
Class 2274 - 2 classes x 12 students = 24 students
Class 2275 - 2 classes x 12 students = 24 students
Class 2276- 3 classes x 12 students = 36 students
 

Will each student require TWO Testing Vouchers for the Microsoft Exams (70-290 & 70-291) and could you please confirm the total number of testing vouchers required. 





ANSWER: The 24 students taking course 2274, 2275 and 2276 are the same 24 students, so we’ll need 24 test vouchers for exam 70-290.  The additional 12 students taking course 2276 will also require test vouchers, so we’ll need a total of 36 vouchers for exam 70-291.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  DESC issues Solicitation SP0600-04-R-0106 for the free issuance of 500 fuel purchase credit cards permitting US Government employees to obtain an estimated 60,000 gallons of Premium Unleaded Gasoline, NSN 9130-01-485-0982, EN 228, Line Item 002-27; an estimated 40,000 gallons of Diesel Fuel, NSN 9140-01-493-5556, EN 590, Line Item 002-13; and an estimated 500 gallons of Motor Oil, Name Brand Specification, Line Item 002-C5 from the contractor’s service stations within France.  The card system should have the capability to separate fuel purchase data from motor oil purchase data, bill fuel to one payment office and bill motor oil to another, and have security procedures to prohibit the purchase of other goods and services.  The invoice data should be reported at Level III, invoices should indicate the quantity purchased during each transaction, and any taxes should be excluded or shown separated.  Card usage should be limited to France, but not geographically limited within France.  Card usage is anticipated on major roadways between the German border and lower Normandy and within the lower Normandy area.  All U.S. military and civilian personnel of the U.S. government who operate official U.S. government owned/leased vehicles or military vehicles and posses valid cards and official dispatch orders for operation of said vehicles at time of delivery will be authorized to use these cards.  Cards should be printed with a “TF LOG 60” identified on the card and on invoices.  Solicitation SP0600-04-R-0106 is being issued as a request for proposals and constitutes the only solicitation.  The performance period is from 15 May 2004 to 30 June 2004.  The government shall not be liable for transactions made after the expiration date of the contract.  The NAICS code is 424720 and the small business size standard is 500.  

DESC may conduct discussions with offerors submitting proposals under subject solicitation, but due to time constraints it anticipates awarding a contract based on the initial offer submitted.  Each offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint.  Award will be made to a single card provider and items will be awarded on an all-or-none basis.  Award decisions will be based on a Best Value determination of three factors:  technical proposal (i.e., Charge Card System capabilities and service station network meeting or exceeding DESC’s needs), price and past performance.  Offerors are advised that the Government is more interested in obtaining quality performance than lowest price and may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  However, the Government will not pay a price premium that it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the offeror’s technical proposal or record of past performance.  In determining best overall value, the Government will evaluate and rate each offeror’s technical proposal and past performance based on pre-established standards.  The technical proposal is of greater importance than price and past performance combined.  Between price and past performance, price is of greater importance.  The offer selected as best value will represent the best tradeoff to the Government among technical proposal, price, and past performance.  

The provision at FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Offer packages should include along with prices, 1) a description of the credit card’s capabilities and extent to which the credit card can meet the stated requirements; 2) a statement of the timeframe from contract award to distribution of cards to the customer, 3) an explanation of the offeror’s card distribution method and procedures for replacing lost or stolen cards, 4) identification of any replacement, transaction or other fees included in the offer price, and 5) a list or map indicating locations of service stations that accept the cards that are situated along the Germany-to-Normandy roadways and in the lower Normandy area and the service station’s hours of operation when they accept credit cards.  Prices should be in Euros per liter.  Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, with their offer.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The Offer Submission Package and the following clauses are available in full text (see reference package posted to the France PC&S Homepage):  B19.02, Economic Price Adjustment (Overseas), I1.04, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, I1.05, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, and L2.05-5, Instructions To Offerors – Commercial Items (PCS).  All documents associated with Solicitation SP0600-04-R-0106 can be found at the identified Web address. 

The Government contemplates award of a Requirements Type, Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment contract resulting from this solicitation.  After award, the contract price will escalate / de-escalate in accordance with Clause B19.02, Economic Price Adjustment (Overseas)(DESC Aug 2000) as stated in the reference package.  

Cards must be no fees.  Offer prices for fuel should be based on the reference prices in effect on April 28, 2004.

<ARCHDATE>07092004
<CONTACT>Carole Hubbard, (256)876-3390
<DESC>This is Amendment 0003 to combined synopsis/solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 for the purpose of providing industry questions and government responses.  The proposal due date is hereby extended to 10 May 2004, 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST).  For those questions/responses that resulted in a change to the requirement, you will need to make a pen and ink change to the original synopsis/solicitation.  Solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 will not be reposted in its entirety.  Due to the immediate need for th ese aerial surveillance platforms, no further industry questions should be submitted.  There is no guarantee that any further questions will be answered.  Q1: In view of the fact that no airplane company makes and installs sensors and no sensor company mak es airplanes for installation of its sensors and neither type company makes and neither installs the types of avionics required it appears that at least three or four other NAICS codes should be included or incorporated into this solicitation.  Is this sol icitation limited to airplane manufactures only?  A1: Our market research indicates aircraft with sensors of the type specified in the solicitation are commercially available.  Our requirement is for aircraft with sensors, not individual items.  This solic itation is not limited to aircraft manufacturers only.  Q2: In order to deliver an aerial surveillance aircraft platform and surveillance system which has reliability and maintainability characteristics that support a system operations tempo (OPTEMPO) of 8  hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, with an aircraft availability rate of ninety percent (90%) Mission Capable (MC) for completion of an 8-hour mission under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and given the temperature conditions during  the summer and fall in that country, adiabatic cooling would not provide a cockpit environment of less than 90-105 degrees F until reaching approximately 15,000 feet.  This fact means that heat injuries could easily be encountered by even conditioned troo ps over the 8 hour plus mission profile envisioned. In that pilots and other crewmembers cannot pull over to the side of the road or otherwise decrease the stress of the operation in these temps does the government anticipate requiring air conditioning of the equipment so as to decrease heat stress on the crew as is the case in most US combat aircraft?  A2: Air conditioning is not a requirement for this aircraft.  Q3: RE: 3.0.2 Mission Profile ( . . . and shall require only commercial fuels (M OGAS 80-87 oc tane))  Does the government consider Jet fuel, JP-8, JP-4, or other similar aircraft fuels as non-commercial or is it limiting the type of fuel to those two types of fuel?  MOGAS and 80-87 engines are of such limited horsepower (200 or less) that an aircra ft equipped to perform a surveillance mission of this type would be extremely limited give the atmospheric conditions of Iraq.  A3:  MOGAS low octane is the requirement.  Please note that 91 octane is acceptable (Amendment 0002, Question 3).  Q4:  What is the availability of either MOGAS or 80-87 and who is controlling the quality of this fuel to assure that it is usable for aircraft under the provisions of the FAA FAR?  A4: The availability and quality control of this fuel is an operational area of concern  and should not affect proposal submission.  Q5: What provisions have been made in the handling and dispensing of fuel that assures non-contamination of the fuel so as to prevent abrogation of warranties thru negligence on the part of the operator?  A5: Wa rranty issues will be resolved on a case by case basis.  Q6: The requirement that the aircraft must have an agile and stealthy profile to allow its aircrew to identify potential threats and avoid ground fire and other threats to low flying aircraft presupp oses that the aircraft will be flying at a low level.  In view of the fact that the slant range for most small arms of 12.7mm and below is about 1500 ft and the  slant range of the SA-7 is about 8-10,000 ft, it would seem reasonable to conduct this type of operation at or above 8,000 feet.  What constitutes an agile and stealthy profile and how will this be measured?  A6: The aircraft should be capable of short fi eld operations with the ability to take off and land from unimproved areas.  The aircraft will also have a low noise and heat signature.  Q7: RE:  FAA FAR Part 121 Operating Requirements:  Domestic, Flag and Supplemental Operations.  In view of the fact th at this airplane will probably weigh in at less than 12.500 lbs, which paragraphs of FAA FAR Part 121 are applicable to this solicitation?  A7: All paragraphs pertaining to the manufacture of reciprocating engine fixed wing aircraft and the safety measures  associated therein.  Q8: Does the government anticipate that the contractor will be conducting active training of the flight students during actual missions in Iraq?  A8:  No.  Q9: What is the billing address for payment of this solicitation?  A9: The bil ling address will be a US address and will be further defined at the time of contract award.  Q10: There is no CLIN for the training of sensors.  Airborne Electronic Sensor Operators (AESOps) are not pilots and pilots are not, generally, AESOPs.  In view o f the fact that there has been no mention of trained AESOPs as there has been of trained pilots, what is the training level of the being selected for this program?  A10: The selected pilots will also be the sensor operators.  Q11:  Will the government add a CLIN for AESOPs training?  A11:  No.  The sensor training is part of the pilot training.  Q12: We respectively request a written determination from the Contracting Officer as to why, given the dates for award of non-negotiated and negotiated award dates that an additional 14 days for bid preparation cannot be made for this solicitation?  A12:  This aerial surveillance platform is a very urgent requirement and it is imperative that we receive proposals, conduct evaluations and award a contract as soon as p ossible.  Due to the number of questions received, the proposal due date has been extended to 10 May 2004, 4:00 p.m. CST.  It is highly unlikely that any further extension will be granted.  Q13: Exactly what makes/models aircraft will be acceptable?  If un able to list, please further define the requirement by stating the minimum number of engines, minimum payload in pounds and minimum number of seats.  A13: The minimum number of engines is one.  The minimum payload is relative to the aircraft capability to perform the mission profile.  Can it take off with full fuel capacity, can it perform the required onstation mission and return with required fuel reserves.  The minimum number of seats is two.  Q14: Please confirm the required loitering speed . . . 60-80 knots.  A14:  The required loitering speed is 60-80 knots.  Q15: The original synopsis/solicitation for this aircraft required the aircraft to have an agile and stealthy profile.  Aircraft stealth covers many aspects of an aircraft signature, from radar to  acoustic.  Similarly, aircraft agility can be defined in terms of energy maneuverability, roll/pitch/yaw rates or subjective pilot opinion.  Can these requirements be quantified or deleted?  A15:  See the answer to question 6.  Q16: Is a subcontractor fro m Russia acceptable, provided that the main contractor is from a qualified country?  A16: There are no restrictions on subcontractor sources.  CORRECTION TO PREVIOUSLY ANSWERED QUESTION:  Amendment 0001, A5 is hereby changed to state that IFF capability is  required.  The last sentence of paragraph 3.0.5 is changed to read The aircraft shall be equipped with an encoding transponder with IFF capability for ATC identification and for operations within civil and military ATC infrastructure.  The point of contac t for this action is Carole Hubbard, Contracting Officer, fax number (256) 955-8364 or email to carole.hubbard@redstone.army.mil.
