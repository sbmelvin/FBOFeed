<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) to Siemens Energy, Inc., 1345 Ridgeland Parkway Suite 116 Alpharetta, GA 30004 for the design, equipment and installation required for replacement of medium voltage switchgear. The SATOC acquisition addresses the need of multiple projects requiring essentially the same work in multiple locations throughout the electrical power system. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">AEDC has the need to procure medium voltage switchgear that is reliable and safe. Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is the latest technology that provides power without requiring personnel to be equipped with arc flash personal protective equipment (PPE) while operating or maintaining the GIS equipment. Hours of industry wide research, competitive bidding, and accepted maintenance and reliability practice have resulted in the conclusion that Siemens Type 8DA10 Gas Insulated Switchgear is the only OEM switchgear that confines each of the three phases of power in three separate compartments. This is a critical requirement from a safety standpoint and mitigates electrical fault severity to avoid costly shutdowns of the entire system. With the isolation of the phases a factory-trained Siemens employee can remove the damaged phase and replace it with the identical part from a spare cubicle, and return the cubicle to service in a short amount of time. In most cases this work can be completed with the remainder of the switchgear lineup still in service. If spares are available, a new enclosure could be installed from the spare cubicle but the entire lineup would be unavailable throughout the duration of the repair. <br /><br />Additionally, the unique mission that occurs at AEDC allows for only a narrow window for repairs and&nbsp;does not allow for new switchgear to be designed to fit the current system. &nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency, Aviation Wing, Warner Robins will acquire replenishment spare parts applicable to the E-3 Aircraft using other than full and open competition procedures. (See Note 22, 26 below.)
<p>Note: This requirement was previously synopsized (19 Jan 2016) under SPRWA1-16-R-0019 but is being modified due to a significant change in the requirement. Purchase Request FD20601600024 authorizes a Firm Fixed Price contract for Power Supplies and RF AMPs.

<DESC><strong>Amendment 0001 to RFI# W909MY-16-R-C017</strong> <br /><strong><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</strong> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION: No award will be made as a result of this request. This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses and is in no way obligated by the information received. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing a future acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. NOTE: The use of RFI Number W909MY-16-R-C017 is for tracking purposes only.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION:</strong>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground - Belvoir (ACC-APG-Belvoir) is conducting market research on behalf of PEO Integrated Electronic Weapon Systems (PEO IEWS) / Program Manager Electro-Optic Infrared Payloads Force Protection (PdM EOIR Payloads- Force Protection) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. PdM EOIR is looking for potential supplier's comments on the procurement specification for the Non Developmental Item (NDI), or near NDI ground-based Electro-Optic/Infrared/Short-Wave Infrared/Laser Range Finder/Laser Pointer (EO/IR/SWIR/LRF/LP) surveillance system for detection and tracking of targets of interest such as walking humans, small vehicles, and large vehicles.<br /><br />The Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) is a program of record begun in Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) as part of the development and acquisition portfolio of the PdM EOIR Payloads - Force Protection, which is a subordinate office of the Project Manager Terrestrial Sensors within the Program Executive Office, Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).
<p>The G-BOSS(E) is an expeditionary, ground-based, self-contained, multi-spectral sensor-oriented, persistent surveillance system used to observe, collect, detect, classify, identify, track, record, and report on contacts, objects of interest, and assessed threats twenty-four hours a day using a display of fused video and sensor data. The G-BOSS(E) is used for mid to long range persistent surveillance. This system will be of a size and weight that allows mobility, transportability, scalability, and modularity consistent with deployment and employment using common U.S. air, land and sea transport assets. The G-BOSS(E) will be capable of independent employment or as part of a network base security and defense system.</p>
<p>The current procurement specification for the ground-based surveillance EO/IR/SWIR/LRF/LP sensors are defined in the document entitled "Electro-Optic/Infrared/Short-Wave Infrared/Laser Range Finder/Laser Pointer (EO/IR/SWIR/LRF/LP) Sensor Subsystem Specification (SbS)." The document is Distribution D restricted. The document is authorized for use by the U.S. Government Agencies and their U.S. contractors only. The document contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.), as amended. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. This document will be disseminated in accordance with provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25.</p>
<p>Companies or organizations should request a copy of the procurement specification by providing their Point of Contact information listed below to william.j.newmeyer.civ@mail.mil and must clearly state if and how they meet the conditions under which they can receive the documents referenced above. In addition, companies requesting the above information must register for an account with an internet accessible portal known as the Corporate Management System Online (CMS II). Registrants will access the CMS II website (https://www.mycmsportal.com) and follow instructions to complete registration. The procurement specification document is currently available for viewing in the CMS II under the W909MY-16-R-C017 folder so the registrants must specifically request access to only the W909MY-16-R-C017 folder. Access to the W909MY-16-R-C017 folder documents will only be granted upon verification that criteria dictated by Distribution D and export control restrictions are met by registered companies or organizations.</p>

Additionally, this Sources Sought Notice is to inform interested parties of an upcoming industry day being hosted at the Adelphi Laboratory Center, Building 205, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, 20783-1197 tentatively scheduled for 13 December 2016 at 9:00AM.

Objective:
<p>To find sources that are qualified to meet the requirements in section 11B and 11C within the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). Note that the specific requirements are subject to change prior to the release of any solicitation.<br /><br />B. Requirements:<br />The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Adelphi Division on behalf of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this Market Research is to identify concerns that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to provide Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This Sources Sought is issued to communicate the ARL's program requirement to industry. ARL intends to use information gathered from these responses to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support formulation of an acquisition strategy. Early industry involvement in creating a properly scaled enterprise solution is critical to the success of this contemplated acquisition. <br /><br />C. Specifications:<br />This effort is for the Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This work includes research and technical services supporting mission areas defined in Technology Program Agreements with Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) centers in information assurance (IA) and computer network operations. ARL collaborates with partners in other CSSPs, the law enforcement and counter intelligence communities in the areas of technology development and computer security research. The focus across the effort is defense against the sophisticated cyber adversaries to ARL, the Army, DoD, and the United States (US) Government. This effort strives to improve the state of the art in cyber defense. Cyber defense R&amp;D is reliant on raw data from real-world networks that contain vital evidence of the threats being perpetrated by hostiles against the network. Analysis of the data and the ability to improve attack detection accuracy and timeliness is intrinsically coupled with the agile development of new tools and techniques to combat adversaries. This ARL cyber defense effort partners with many organizations; some of which use the ARL CSSP services to provide primary or supplementary network defense services. Some are research partners using ARL-developed cyber defense tools and test-beds, and others are intelligence and law enforcement organizations that leverage ARL technology and share vital information about current threats. The extensive network view is a key enabler to the cyber research and technology enhancement mission. This effort's initiative is particularly focused on improving capabilities to combat sophisticated cyber adversaries as well as investigating the next generation of Defensive Cyber Operational Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), tactical network security, exploring prospective sensor capabilities, executing components of the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) strategy, risk measurement and monitoring, improving adversary attribution, and insider threat analysis. The ARL cyber mission uniquely derives its strength from the close synergistic bond between research and the technical services answering operational necessities. These activities demand skilled, forward-thinking staff at every position.<br /><br />The objective of this effort is research and develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic cyber domain while providing 24x7 Cyber Defense Operations and Services within the environment of the Department of Defense<br /><br />D. Industry Day:<br />Additionally, this Sources Sought is to inform interested parties of an upcoming Industry Day being hosted at Building 205 2800 Powder Mill Rd, 20783-1197 tentatively scheduled for 13 December 2016 at 9:00AM. <br />All parties interested in the Industry Day shall notify this office by email<br />NO LATER THAN 3:00 pm EST on 01 December 2016.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single-source procedures.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a purchase order to Inventive Electronics of Niceville, Florida to meet testing requirements for various Primary and Secondary Radar systems in support of Program Office ANG-E55. Specifically, this procurement is for a Radar Environment Simulator (RES), 2nd Generation Radar Target Generator (RTG) (L/S Band) as well as Mobile Radar Analysis Support System for Sites (RASS-S) Workstation for the Mode-S Program. 

Currently, there are three FAA Second Level Engineering organizations that use the RES, which have been previously procured via Inventive Electronics. ANG-E55 has an existing need to replace their internally developed simulators as they are beginning to fail and impact the mission of the subject organization.  In an effort to standardize test equipment used by the FAA and to utilize the previously developed test scenarios ANG-E55 determined it is in the best interest of the agency to purchase equipment currently used in the FAA.

Research has revealed that Inventive Electronics is the sole manufacturer of the specific RES and its components. Inventive Electronics retains the proprietary data rights and is the only vendor capable of providing the required RES Workstation. There are no third party resellers. 

A competitive acquisition is not available for this requirement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement.

All responses to this announcement must be directed to Ashley.Gesicki@faa.gov no later than Noon Eastern Standard Time, January 20, 2017.

<DESC>This project is a total small business set-aside.&nbsp; The compelete specifications will be available for download at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> in the near future.<br /><br />The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, labor, supplies, supervision, transportation, and incidentals necessary to perform the work in accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions contained within.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The hoedad planting (Item 1) will take place on the Bass Lake Ranger District. The auger planting and release (Item 2 &amp; Option Items) will take place on the High Sierra Ranger District. At this time the option items are not funded. The option items will be done in part, in whole or not at all to the degree funding becomes available. The number of trees for each item is an estimate and may vary significantly. The objective is to plant all the trees that the Districts have available. It is possible that additional or alternate sites will be used to achieve this goal. <br /><br />The Soaproot project was harvested in the last several years, thinning and piling was completed last year. These areas have also been impacted by the ongoing tree mortality event the District is experiencing. At this time burning of the piles has not been completed. It is possible that it will be by the expected start of this contract but it is more likely that it will not. Planting will go on regardless. It will be necessary to work around the piles. This may reduce the number of trees planted per acre.<br /><br />Option item 1: The Aspen fire burned more than 20,000 acres on the High Sierra R.D. during the summer of 2013. Harvest of the burned and dying trees occurred during the summer of 2014 continuing into 2015. At this time twelve units have been identified as planting opportunities for this contract (see maps). It is possible that we will find other opportunities that we may substitute or add to those areas identified on the maps. The goal is to plant all our seedlings. The listed units are recently harvested stands that have been prepared for planting (post- harvest) by felling the small dead trees and piling the slash for burning. The burning has been completed. It is also possible that areas that have been harvested but received no post- harvest treatment or areas where no activity occurred after the fire but are in need of planting maybe identified. The acres on the maps are the gross acres of the entire unit, in some units the entire unit may not be plantable. This may be due to poor soil, wet areas, areas where the fire did not kill the trees and areas that have natural regeneration of conifers occurring. In some units only sections required additional site preparation, it was determined at that time that the rest of the unit was either not in need of planting, not plantable or plantable as it was. In these cases ground that is plantable will be planted regardless of the lack of additional site preparation. If plantable ground is adjacent to the marked units we may plant that as well.
<p>Option Items 2 &amp; 3 area requires manual release of the planted seedlings on the soaproot and aspen projects. It is anticipated that manual release will be necessary on much of this ground. Units will be evaluated during planting to determine the priority units or sections of units. This may include all or some (or possibly none) of the planted areas. This work will be paid by the acre. The actual planted area in each unit that requires release will be measured after planting and this measured acreage used for payment of the manual release. The decision to release or not will be made within 30 days of planting.</p>
<p>Note: Prospective bidders are encouraged to inspect the project sites prior to submitting a quote. For information on road, ground conditions, and/or maps prior to site inspection, contact Ray Acker at the High Sierra R.D. Ranger District, (559) 855-5355ext. 3312. At this time of year access to the Aspen project area is through a locked gate so it will be necessary to contact Ray Acker. Also access may not be possible depending on road conditions as these roads are not maintained during the winter. In addition to the possibility of snow covered roads there is a high likely hood of falling trees blocking the road especially to the Aspen project.<br />The contact for the Bass Lake (Item 1) is Francey Blaugrund (559) 877-2218 ext 3282.</p>

<p>NASA is considering contracting with The Boeing Company (Boeing) for crew transportation services to and from the International Space Station (ISS) on the Russian Soyuz vehicle. This transportation would be for one crewmember in the Fall of 2017 and one crewmember in the Spring of 2018. NASA is considering purchasing these services from Boeing, without competition, because no other vehicles are currently capable of providing these services in Fall 2017 or Spring 2018. NASA has contracts with two U.S. commercial companies for crew transportation to the ISS. However, these vehicles are still in the developmental stage, and not expected to begin fully operational flights to the ISS until 2019. NASA also is considering an option to acquire crew transportation from Boeing for three crewmembers on the Soyuz in 2019, to ensure the availability of back-up transportation capability in the event the U.S. commercial contractor vehicles are delayed or to augment future ISS operations and research.</p>
<p>NASA is issuing this synopsis in order to provide notice of the Agency's requirements and to determine whether any other potential sources have the current capability to provide these crew transportation services in the needed timeframes. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to provide the crew transportation services described below. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. The determination of whether or not to acquire these services without competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Submissions must be provided in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 27, 2017. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government intends to acquire the described services as a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Description of Services to be Acquired</p>
<p>The services NASA is considering acquiring from Boeing are the launch, return, and rescue of U.S. or U.S. designated astronauts and associated services, which include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Launch and return of U.S. Operating Segment (USOS) Crew members to the ISS for planned six-month missions. <br /><br />&bull; On-orbit rescue services for the duration of six-month missions.<br /><br />&bull; Provision of Emergency Rescue services and medical support, post flight medical support. <br /><br />&bull; Search and Rescue services and recovery at landing site.<br /><br />&bull; Theoretical and practical training of Astronauts for nominal, off nominal and sea survival activities.<br />&nbsp;<br />&bull; Customized Astronaut launch, training and landing gear including: Seat liners, Sokol, Water Survival Cold Weather and Elemental Survival suits.<br /><br />&bull; Media personnel technical and logistical support to facilitate broadcasting of flight related activities, facilitating the communication of NASA and ISS success to the world. <br />&bull; Ground support and transportation for up to 110 NASA personnel and delegates for launch, landing and associated events including visa support, housing, logistics, security and clearance for facility access.<br />&nbsp;<br />&bull; Limited cargo services for storage, delivery to, and return, from the ISS including disposal of trash from the ISS for cargo associated with crew delivery and return.<br />&nbsp;<br />&bull; Spacecraft telemetry and support services for all stages of flight.<br /><br /><br />Background<br /><br />The purchase of these services in 2017 and 2018 will increase US crew size on the ISS from three to four crew members to maximize ISS science utilization. Maximizing science utilization of the ISS is a program priority as required by the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 and the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA) of 2015. Given the statutory requirements contained in the 2010 Authorization Act and the 2015 CSLCA, NASA constantly seeks opportunities to maximize scientific utilization of the ISS to achieve the largest possible return on the investment made by the United States and its international partners in the development, assembly, and operations of this unique laboratory.</p>
<p>NASA also has a need for the option to procure crew transportation services in the spring of 2019 time frame to provide either a primary or a backup crew transportation capability. An option ordering period ending in the fall of 2017 will allow NASA to evaluate performance of U.S. crew transportation services providers currently on contract and determine if back up capability is needed or if more crew time may be necessary to maximize research onboard the ISS and the U.S. National Laboratory in 2019. Crew transportation services are currently provided via a contract with the Russian State Space Corporation "Roscosmos" through 2018. NASA has contracts with two U.S. commercial providers developing new crew transportation systems, which are anticipated to provide domestic crew rotation transportation service to and from the ISS beginning in 2019. In the event the U.S. commercial crew providers are delayed in demonstrating a fully operational capability to transport humans to space, the risk of de-crewing ISS greatly increases. The absence of US crew members at any point would diminish vehicle operations to an inoperable state. As a means to mitigate that risk and to ensure that proper launch cadence is maintained for future launches to the ISS, NASA intends to include a contract option from Boeing for its Soyuz seats in CY 2019 that will provide NASA with a capability to ensure uninterrupted access to the ISS while U.S. commercial providers establish that their vehicles have full operational capability, or provide for more crew time to maximize research onboard the ISS and the U.S. National Laboratory in 2019.</p>
<p>The Russian Soyuz is currently the only vehicle with the operational capability to provide crew services to and from the ISS in 2017 and 2018. There are eight Soyuz launches planned between CYs 2017 and 2018 (four per year). The crew capacity of the Soyuz is limited to a maximum of three crew members per vehicle. Because of this limitation, the current launch cadence utilized by NASA to transport crew to the ISS and maintain the current crew complement employs Soyuz launches that alternate between two types of crew configurations. The first Soyuz configuration ("Line A") includes a single US crew member and two Russian crew members that are transported to the ISS. The second Soyuz configuration ("Line B"), usually timed to launch within a couple months of Line A, includes two US crew members and a single Russian crew member. This cadence maintains a typical crew complement of three US crew members aboard the ISS.</p>
<p>Russia recently announced its plans to decrement the Russian crew count onboard ISS from three to two, beginning in CY 2017. As a result of Russia reducing its crew count by one crewmember, there is now an available Soyuz seat in the 2017-2018 timeframe on each of the two planned spacecraft that would have otherwise had two Russian crew aboard. Of the 24 total Soyuz seats available in 2017-2018, the three seats resulting from the Russian crew decrement are the only available means of transporting additional US crewmembers to ISS during this period.</p>
<p>An agreement was recently reached between the Boeing Company and S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Public Corporation, Energia ("RSC Energia"), who is the manufacturer of the Soyuz spacecraft and has the legal rights to sell the seats and associated services. As a part of this agreement, Energia agreed to provide to Boeing two specifically identified seats on the Soyuz spacecraft for long-duration travel to and from the ISS, one on a flight to occur in the Fall 2017 timeframe and another on a flight to occur in the Spring 2018 timeframe. Additionally, Energia provided Boeing three additional specifically identified seats in the Spring 2019 timeframe on two Soyuz spacecraft. Finally, Boeing and RSC Energia agreed that each of these five seats will include a launch of an individual to and from the ISS, including all services normally provided during launches to ISS. Boeing and RSC Energia have represented that Boeing has the full rights to these seats and can sell them to any third party.</p>
<p>Since both U.S. commercial contractors' vehicles are still in the developmental stage, and not expected to begin fully operational flights to the ISS until 2019, the Russian Soyuz is currently the only vehicle capable of meeting the Government's needs in the required timeframes. As stated above, Boeing has obtained the exclusive ownership rights to these particular Soyuz seats and ancillary services during the stated time periods. The option for these Soyuz services in the Spring of 2019 time frame may be utilized as a primary or backup transportation capability to ensure proper launch cadence with no gaps in crew rotation transportation, or to augment future ISS operations and research. However, after U.S. commercial entities are fully operational and able to fulfill crew transportation requirements, the U.S. commercial vehicles will be NASA's primary transportation source to ISS.</p>

<DESC>This is a presolicitation of a proposed acquisition of a Capstan Actuator Test System (CATS) for the V-22 Osprey. Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD), Lakehurst, NJ, 08733, will release a Request For Proposal (RFP) to qualified manufacturers who have the capability to design and build a Capstan Actuator Test System (CATS) for the V-22 Osprey if provided the Capstan Actuator Drive and Control Module Wing Stow Drawing and Parts List, a Statement of Work for the Test System, the current Acceptance Test Procedures for the Capstan Actuator, and specifications for the CATS itself.
<p>The RFP will contain export controlled and restricted release information, and as such the potential manufacturers will be required to submit a current MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT, DD 2345. Due to the export controlled information that will be contained in the RFP, in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(5)(i) the complete RFP will not be posted on FedBizOps; only the instructions for how to receive the documents are being released on this website.</p>
<p>In addition, market research has determined that this action will be set aside as a Small Business Set Aside. Only small businesses should request to receive the proposal. Prior to RFP mailing, the DD2345 will be verified as current, and the Small Business status will be verified in System for Award Management (SAM) by the Government. Prior to final award, challenges to the small business status will be permitted by competitors in this action.</p>
<p>To provide for a fair competition, this presolicitation notice will be open for 30 days. Qualified vendors will be mailed a CD that has all of the necessary files needed to provide a complete Firm Fixed Price proposal. The file will provide specifically:<br /><br />1- Statement of Work for CATS<br />2- Specifications for CATS with overview of performance requirements<br />3- Actuator Acceptance Test Plan for the V-22 Capstan Actuator<br />4- Capstan Actuator Drive and Control Module Wing Stow Drawing and Parts list<br />5- Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) for CATS<br />6- RFP SF33 SOLICITATION, OFFER AND AWARD - will form basis of eventual contract.</p>
<p>The RFP will identify the installation location for the CATS. The accepted CATS proposal will provide NAWC-AD a complete production level drawing package and specifications (including adequate rights for future competition and possible manufacture by a third party should the need for an additional CATS arise).</p>
<p>After the Presolicitation period expires, the RFP will be mailed out to all vendors on the same day. (Please expect mailing approximately one week after closing) All participants will have the same amount of time to respond. The initial RFP closing date will be approximately 40 days after the overnight mailing of the RFP Disks (SF33 will have exact date). To avoid an open ended solicitation period, NAVAIR reserves the right to limit extending the RFP period to questions received only during the first 15 days after RFP release, after which time no time extensions will be permitted. 10 days prior to RFP closing, NAVAIR reserves the right to not answer further questions. Any answers will be disseminated to all competing vendors via email to ensure no one has an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>At this time, potential manufacturers are asked to only provide their DD2345, and affirm their Small Business Status. Please send that information via email to <a href="mailto:Robert.battaglia@navy.mil">Robert.battaglia@navy.mil</a>.</p>

<p><br />B. Purpose of the Solicitation<br />The Louisville District is seeking up to three (3) highly qualified firms (the "Consultant") to provide VE services for workshops of a wide range of project types typically for but not limited to various military, environmental, and civil works projects. The work will be performed under task order contracts that are negotiated based on scope. The work will be performed by negotiated Firm Fixed Price Task Orders issued under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract.</p>
<p><br />C. Contract Terms<br />The term of the contracts awarded from this solicitation will be for a period of five (5) consecutive years commencing upon the Agency's notice to proceed. This announcement is set aside for <strong>Small Business Only</strong>, with at least <strong>ONE</strong> of the awarded firms being a <strong>Women Owned</strong> small business. If you are a women owned business please ensure this is clearly indicated. The base contract maximum cumulative value is $3,000,000.00 for each awarded firm. Task orders are expected to range from approximately $20,000 to $250,000; however, larger task orders up to the maximum contract value may be awarded. The base contract cumulative total dollar amount cannot be guaranteed since the task orders are on an as-needed basis. Task orders may be assigned for any work within the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Contract capacity may be shared with other Districts throughout the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>D. Schedule<br />It is anticipated the base contract(s) award will be approximately April/May 2017.</p>
<p>E. Acronyms and General Definitions<br />Value Engineering (VE), Value Analysis (VA), Value Management (VM), Certified Value Specialist (CVS). VE, VA, and VM are all synonymous. Studies and Workshops are synonymous.<br /><br />&emsp;<br />Section 2 - Scope of Services</p>
<p>A. Agency Goals and Objectives<br />The Louisville District's goal is to use the Value Engineering/Value Management process to ensure the project(s) needs and required functions are met in the highest value possible; where value is defined as functions divided by resources. The overall goal is to have a viable VE program by performing VE work that our customers appreciate, respect and actively seek the involvement of value management.</p>
<p>The objective is to analyze and then optimize, via VE studies, both the capital cost of a project and the long-term operating costs. This is achieved by finding alternatives to elements within the project's design which maximize the function to resource ratio. The Louisville District VE Program seeks to help projects achieve a full scope award, within budget, and on schedule while maintaining quality features that are aesthetically pleasing, have a low maintenance requirement, a long term replacement period, and low operations cost. Therefore, the VE methodology used for work with the Louisville District shall be grounded in function analysis.</p>
<p>B. Agency Requirements of Consultant Approach to Value Engineering Studies<br />VE, VA, and VM workshops will follow the formal SAVE International approved job plan as well as the USACE VE Standard (COVE 2015-02). The Consultant/Agency contractual relationship will be a partnership to achieve the goals and objectives stated above; thus, acceptance of a task order scope of work implies agreement to the approach; otherwise, a written alternative approach is required prior to the award of a task order. The CVS team leader is the primary point of contact (POC) for assigned project task orders, after the contract has been negotiated and awarded, and will be responsible for all contract matters, task management, and assuring the successful execution of the scope. All CVS team leaders shall be accredited by SAVE International.</p>
<p>C. Partnering Conference<br />All successful firms who are awarded a base IDIQ contract with the Louisville District will be required to attend an initial two-day partnering workshops, to define the Government's expectations of the A/E, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and identify common goals. Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected firms. The firm(s) must bring at a minimum: the primary POC for the firm and at least one senior CVS team leader.</p>
<p>D. Standardized VE Software/Forms<br />The Louisville District has been working to develop standards for the execution of VE workshops which has translated into a standard Louisville District workshop template. All successful firms must learn and adapt to these forms and workshop report format. The Louisville District Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will provide all training necessary to assure successful adoption of this workflow.</p>
<p>E. Workshop Types<br />The task orders will include performance of formal VE studies, value-based program/project planning/design charrettes, risk analysis including mitigation plans, large program (versus project) level and business process review workshops, lessons learned reviews and after action reviews.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has six (6) different types of VE workshops/levels of effort; Level 1 - Level 6 (Chief Office of Value Engineering COVE 2015-03). The VE requirement may also be addressed by "Bridges and Scans" (COVE 2015-03). The various levels of effort are intended to meet the intent of OMB Circular A-131 as well as comply with USACE policy by scaling the VE approach to match the project complexity and anticipated value opportunity. Although the VE approach is generally defined by the VEO, the firm shall assemble teams and implement the VE methodology in a scalable fashion based on levels of effort while still achieving results.</p>
<p>F. Project Types<br />Projects and programs requiring services under this contract may include but are not limited to large variety of military facilities, complex navigation and flood risk management projects, and extensive environmental restoration projects. These projects may use design/build, adapt/build, design/bid/build and other project delivery methods. Additionally, specialty workshops for headquarters-level program assessments and evaluations of agency-wide engineering business procedures may be required.</p>
<p>G. Relevant Projects<br />Projects that are considered most relevant to the typical work performed by the Louisville District are: Army Reserve Centers, Schools, Barracks, highly specialized labs for the Military, Fire Stations, Hangars, the design and repair of major civil works infrastructure projects like locks and dams, flood protection system, levees, and pump stations. It is not required for the submitted projects to be for the military or the US Government to be considered relevant; however, those who offer a variety that includes both military and civil works type projects may be considered more relevant.</p>
<p>H. Work Assignment Protocol<br />It is anticipated that work will be distributed on a semi-rotational basis. Some of the factors that may affect an even distribution of work is but not limited to the following: the consultants' availability, the consultants' responsiveness, experience with the type of work being performed, and performance on previous task orders on this contract.</p>
<p>I. Core Value Project Team Structure<br />Generally speaking each value team will be comprised of the following core team members: a CVS team leader (may be senior or junior based on project complexity), administrative assistant or assistant team leader, a cost engineer and the principle in charge of the overall federal contract. The remaining team is typically comprised of technical team members who are experts and active/current in their area of expertise. The Louisville District has found the quality of the technical team members provided has a profound effect on the success of the VE workshop and therefore we place value in getting the right people. All value project team members will be approved by the COR and hired on a task order basis based on the direction in the scope of work.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Section 3 - Selection Criteria</p>
<p>A. General<br />This solicitation will be evaluated based on the Primary Selection Criteria first. Secondary selection criteria will be used by a selection board as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms.</p>
<p>B. Primary Selection Criteria <br />The following minimum requirements must be demonstrated by the firm. Failure to meet these minimums will result in non-selection. <br />1. Two senior Certified Value Specialists (CVS) defined as having at least 10 years of experience as a CVS facilitating VE workshops. This means they have been facilitating VE workshops with their CVS for at least 10 years.<br /><br />2. One senior CVS shall be a registered professional Engineer/Architect<br /><br />3. One junior CVS defined as having at least two years but less than 10 years of experience facilitating VE workshops as a CVS. Junior CVS's with an engineering or architectural bachelor's degree from an ABET accredited school will be given additional consideration. A junior CVS with several years of diverse work experience will be given additional consideration. <br /><br />4. All CVSs shall be certified by SAVE <br /><br />5. The three minimum CVS team members must demonstrate VE workshop facilitation within the last three years. <br /><br />i. Demonstrating could be a statement from other customer(s) or a list of projects recently performed<br />ii. The intent is to not only select recent projects to demonstrate current activity because they may or may not be the projects that best represent the proposer . There is latitude given to prove this.<br /><br />6. The three minimum CVS team members must demonstrate having at least three of their five submitted projects as relevant (SF330 Section E Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for This Contract). Team members with more than three relevant projects will be given additional consideration.<br /><br />7. One project must be performed for another customer other than the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SF330 Section F Example Projects Which Best Illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications for This Contract.)<br /><br />8. All submitted projects must have been performed by the firm and led by one of the CVSs submitted in the proposal.</p>
<p>In addition to the above minimum requirements. The primary selection criteria is broken into three parts: Professional Qualifications, Technical Competency and Specialized Experience, Capacity and Past Performance. Professional Qualifications is the most important criteria followed by Technical Competency and Specialized Experience, and then Capacity and Past Performance.</p>
<p>3-1 Professional Qualifications: Beyond the minimum requirements defined in section 3 paragraph B, the following information will be used to further evaluate the team member's qualifications, listed in order of importance for part 3-1:<br /><br />3-1-1 Quality of Function Analysis: Each CVS team leader will be evaluated based on how the function analysis discussion allowed the value team to find more creative solutions that lead to true value alternatives. The function analysis work will be evaluated to ensure it has "unique and meaningful functions" and not "cursory functions". This portion will be evaluated based on a well written discussion that explains how the function work led the team to achieve more creative ideas that pushed the project to achieve higher value.<br /><br />3-1-2 Leadership in the Value Engineering Profession: Each CVS team leader will be evaluated based on their involvement with and contributions to the VE Profession. More recent contributions may be evaluated more favorably.<br /><br />3-2 Technical Competence and Specialized Experience: Beyond the minimum requirements defined in section 3 paragraph B, the following information will be used to further evaluate the firm's specialized experience and technical competence, listed in order of importance for part 3-2:<br /><br />3-2-1 Mastery of the Value Methodology: The Consultant's response to the sample VE workshop summaries is expected to demonstrate a true understanding of function analysis, how the function analysis contributed to the final value engineering solutions, how the solutions resulted in true value alternatives, and how the results yielded measurably significant value contributions to the overall sample project being studied.<br />&nbsp;<br />Terminology &amp; Definitions:<br />a. Demonstration of a "true understanding of function analysis" would be in the form of project specific functions (not cursory or general) that are active verbs and measureable nouns that define the essence of the project in a fundamental way. The functions should define "What the project must do to be successful".</p>
<p>b. True value alternatives are alternatives that maximize the Value expression of Functions divided by Resources without sacrificing quality. A true value alternative would maintain quality or enhance quality while maintaining function or increasing function while reducing resources or maintaining resources. True value alternatives are not cost cutting options. A true value alternative has a high probability of being universally recognized as a value enhancing alternative.</p>
<p>c. Significant value contribution means it was accepted by the customer, it was implemented into the project, and changed the direction of the project in a positive way.</p>
<p>3-2-2 Effective Communication: The Consultant will be evaluated on how effective they are at succinctly conveying ideas, setting the context behind an idea by including all the salient or relevant back ground elements, and selling the idea. The submitted sample Value Engineering Workshop Summaries will be used to evaluate this factor.<br />Terminology &amp; Definitions:<br />a. Selling the idea means presenting the True Value Alternative in narrative form in a succinct way that effectively demonstrates why the value alternative is better than the original idea.<br /><br />3-2-3 Management Plan: The Consultant will be evaluated on the firm's management approach; management of subcontractors (if applicable); quality control procedures (for all products including reports and electronic documents); procedures to insure that internal resources are not over-committed. The Louisville District typically has a very active workload with overlapping schedules. This creates management challenges for the limited US Army Corps VE staff, therefore the successful firm(s) must have organized management procedures. <br />An organizational chart showing the inter-relationship of management and various team components (including subcontractors) is required. This organizational chart is required in Part 1 section D of the SF330.<br /><br />3-2-4 VE Experience: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a narrative that discusses the volume of value engineering studies conducted in the last 36 months that followed the SAVE standard and were greater than 24 hours in length; illustrating how many studies the firm typically performs simultaneously. The firms who demonstrate a high volume of VE workshop experience on an annual basis will be given additional consideration.</p>
<p>3-2-5 Team Member Selection: One of the basic functions of Value Engineering is to "Supplement Knowledge" by infusing expertise. The Consultant will be evaluated based on their process (approach) in selecting individuals (technical team members) for a value engineering study. The Consultant will be evaluated based on the various companies your firm has a relationship (Portfolio Diversity) with that has served as a source for quality technical team members and how long your firm has worked with these companies. The Consultant will also be evaluated based on your firm's ability to find unique or specialized team members for a value engineering study. The Consultant will be evaluated based on the quality of the sampling of technical team members listed in the proposal.<br /><br />Terminology and Definitions:<br />a. Senior Level: Technical team member expertise is critical to the overall success of value studies. The Louisville District defines senior level to be a minimum of 15 years' experience actually performing the work as a credentialed professional and not just managing it. Any technical team member listed shall be experts in design and construction as represented by the types of projects they designed rather than being team members on value studies or having VE credentials.</p>
<p>b. Quality of Technical Team Members: The evaluation factors that will be used to gauge the quality of the technical team members are: relevant expertise applicable to the type of work the Louisville District typically does (defined in Section 2 paragraph G), successful demonstration that team members are experts in his or her field (authored papers/books/codes or their efforts are directly advancing their industry or recognized in the industry as the authority on the subject).</p>
<p>c. Unique/ Specialized Team Members: The Consultant will also be evaluated on their ability to use members from disciplines outside of the "core" technical disciplines (Civil, Architect, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural, Geotechnical) in a way that adds expertise to the team and successfully contributes to its value studies.</p>
<p>d. Portfolio Diversity: The Consultant will be given a more favorable rating for having a diverse portfolio of technical team members in which to pull from, for having a long relationship with these sources, and for having an active relationship defined as working on project(s) together within 2 years or less</p>
<p>e. Valuable Technical Team Member Expertise: Based on the type of work the Louisville District has performed in recent years, the following experience will be considered valuable and will be given additional consideration: expertise that specializes in the design and construction of high performance buildings that can demonstrate actual building performance with post occupancy Energy Use Intensity (EUI) 30% or more below the ASHRAE 90.1 2010 baseline code minimum without photovoltaic (PV) or wind energy, site design expertise that specializes in the design of complicated building sites with challenging features (environmentally sensitive areas, significant utility infrastructure conflicts, grade challenges whether excessively flat or steep, hydraulic challenges), architectural expertise that specializes in the design of efficient architectural floor plan (net to gross ratio of 60% or better), expertise that specializes in the rehabilitation or replacement of critical infrastructure that must reliably function 24/7/365 but in harsh environments with minimal maintenance.</p>
<p>3-2-6 Sample Approach: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a narrative description of the approach to executing VE Workshops for the two sample projects in Attachment A and the rationale for why that approach sets the workshop up for success. The Consultant will be evaluated based on how the approach meets the intent of the SAVE job plan and the USACE VE Standard. The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the workshop duration and the proposed technical team members as well as the associated expertise of those disciplines and how they will contribute to having a highly effective VE workshop.<br /><br />3-2-7 Effective Process: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a brief narrative that describes what makes your process/studies effective. The Consultant will be evaluated based on demonstration of how function analysis techniques assure the correct questions are being asked and the correct solutions are being provided. <br /><br />3-2-8 Workshop Planning: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a brief narrative that describes their experience planning, coordinating, staffing, executing and reporting value engineering studies/workshops for complex military, environmental, and civil works programs and projects. Consultants who demonstrate a higher number of relevant VE workshops in which they were responsible for planning will be given additional consideration. Consultants who also demonstrate a variety of planning relevant VE workshops will be given additional consideration. The Consultant will be evaluated on the firms' procedures that insure a successful VE workshop.<br /><br />3-2-9 Consensus Building: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a brief narrative that describes the firms experience coordinating/organizing large diverse groups with various agendas (some contentious) and how facilitation skills allowed were utilized to arrive at a common list of objectives and requirements for programs and projects. <br /><br />3-2-10 Experience Diversity: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a brief narrative that describes the firms experience doing the following:<br />1. Organizing nontraditional approaches using the Value Methodology and specifically Function Analysis to identify solutions to complex problems<br />i. Nontraditional is defined as something different than a 3-5 day consecutive VE workshop following the 6 step job plan<br />2. Applying the Value Methodology to programmatic level efforts<br />3. Leading/facilitating planning and design charrettes <br />4. Application of the value engineering methodology in a non-conventional or non-standard workshop for which the CVS team leader developed the approach. Additionally, indicate the outcomes of this application.</p>
<p>3-3 Capacity: Beyond the minimum requirements defined in section 3 paragraph B, the following information will be used to further evaluate the Consultant's Capacity, listed in order of importance for part 3-3:<br /><br />3-3-1 Multi-Tasking Capability: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a brief narrative that demonstrates the available capacity to complete two independent VE workshops simultaneously in two different geographic locations. The Consultant will be evaluated based on their ability to handle multiple task orders concurrently with two weeks or less from receipt of the notice to proceed to workshop commencement and two workshops in two different locations nationwide at the same time.<br /><br />3-3-2 Diversity of VE Work: The Consultant will be evaluated based on a brief narrative that discusses the diversity of the firm's client base in which they perform VE work.<br /><br />3-4 Past Performance: The Consultant will be evaluated based on CPARS rating, if available, as well as a brief narrative that describes the firm's past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.<br /><br />D. Secondary Selection Criteria<br />The secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance:<br />Equitable Distribution of DoD Contracts: Volume of DoD A-E contract awards in the last 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB.<br />&emsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Attachment A</p>
<p>Sample Project 1 - Military Renovation:</p>
<p>This project is a renovation and repurpose of an existing building on a military installation within the United States. The renovation is for the unit that currently occupies the building. This unit is expanding their operation and doesn't have any other place to go on this installation or any other nearby facilities, therefore this facility will remain occupied during construction. The facility contains a highly sensitive top secret mission that MUST remain operational at all times and the security protocols MUST remain as well. The top secret mission contains a lab space that is sensitive to temperature and humidity. The original estimated budget was $8 million but the current working estimate is closer to $14 million; since the project is O&amp;M funded it technically doesn't have a fixed budget constraint. The customer has indicated that schedule is more important than cost because they are expected to double staff and they have no place for them to go. The funding source for this project is operations and maintenance which has strict restrictions on how much new work is allowed, therefore it's assumed no additional square footage is allowed beyond the existing building foot print.<br /><br />The scope of the work to be performed is to utilize an abandoned open volume three story portion of the building to create office space. The customer has decided to add the replacement of all heating and ventilation equipment for the entire facility due to the age of the equipment. The DD1391 reads as follows: "Accomplish interior demolition, slab saw cutting, foundation excavation. Provide a structural system for a three level structure, including framing, seismic bracing, floor slabs, stairwells, and an elevator as required by code. Provide interior partitions, door, hardware, ceiling and finishes. Replace facility HVAC system. Provide power and lighting, fire detection, alarm and suppression system." <br /><br />Unfortunately the planning of the value engineering approach/strategy (value management plan) wasn't determined at the beginning of the project, therefore the designer of record (DOR) is expected to submit a set of 65% interim drawings within the next two weeks. The DOR is an AE consultant that has a solid team with a great reputation for doing quality work and they are generally supportive of value engineering. Unfortunately there isn't any language in the DOR's contract that requires them to participate in any value effort.<br />How would the approach change if the DOR didn't have a history of supporting VE and the team wasn't as strong?&emsp;</p>
<p>Sample Project 2 - One of a Kind Civil Project:</p>
<p>This project is located in the United States and is a significant part of the Nation's Infrastructure. These facilities are a part of river navigation and MUST operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. These facilities CANNOT go down otherwise it costs Industry millions of dollars a day. Unfortunately the United States is experiencing nationwide financial strains, and projects like this one keep requiring more and more money each year. This project is considered a Mega Project which comes with a lot of oversight and extra layers of management as well as a lot more review. The total project is over a billion dollars and has many pieces; some of the pieces are already under construction, others are still in the planning and design stage, and some that have been constructed are experiencing problems with wear and tear. <br /><br />The estimated value of the scope that VE is looking at is approximately $175 million.<br />The pieces of the overall project scope the project manager needs the value engineering department to help with are as follows: the miscellaneous repairs of an existing lock facility (~$10M), the design and construction of a specialized piece of equipment for lifting and lowering wickets (~$14M), the excessive accumulation of sediment and the control of water velocities within the immediate upstream and downstream limits of this project (~$90M), and the removal of old lock and dam facilities upon the construction completion of this project (~$60M).<br /><br />The only specific details that are available are on the miscellaneous repairs to the lock facility because that design work is underway. The issues on the lock facility is the surface of the hydraulic cylinders that operate the miter gates and culvert valves are developing imperfections that are damaging the seals and causing fluids to leak and ultimately will impact operations. One of the causes to the damage of these cylinders is due to the fact they remain submerged in the river half the year due to rising flood waters. Also, the electrical and control system that operate the facility is deteriorating and not operating reliably. All of this work is being design by USACE staff in various parts across the nation based on expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contracts, are for a variety of Architect/Engineer services primarily for Army Reserve projects nationwide (including Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa). Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the Government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.
<p>Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for the total contract is $4,000,000. This is a five year contract, with no option years. The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>Up to five firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between Offerors considered as technically equal. Once selected, the following factors will be used in deciding which selected Offeror will be utilized for task orders: past performance, quality of deliverables, capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience. Estimated start date is April 2017.</p>
<p>As a contract specifically procured by the Louisville District for the U.S. Army Reserve, the selected firms and relevant sub-consultants will be required to attend one two-day partnering workshop within 12 months of the award of the IDIQ contract. This workshop will require the attendance of representative from project management, architecture, engineering and interior design disciplines to define the Government's expectations of the Offeror, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and to identify common goals. Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected Offeror.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $35,000 will receive a performance evaluation. A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for Architect-Engineer Services.</p>
<p>2.) PROJECT INFORMATION: The selected offeror will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record or Design-Build RFP preparer for each individual project on their contract.

<DESC><p><strong><em>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS</em></strong><br /><br />This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for supporting and producing field reliable, sustainable, nuclear certified MHU-204 trailers through a service life extension program (SLEP). The effort requires the Contractor to review and refine, as appropriate, the MHU-204 "proof of concept" (PoC) delivered under contract HC1047-05-D-4005 (Order RI-09-0032/0120).</p>
<p>This effort shall result in optimizing/finalizing all MHU-204 PoC documentation, design, testing and configuration to ensure production / overhaul processes are synchronized, streamlined, and integrated as appropriate to adequate support SLEP efforts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>To address aging DoD nuclear deterrent support equipment, USAF approved a permanent modification program slated to extend the service life (20+ yrs) of the MHU-204 trailers. Thus, contract HC1047-05-D-4005 (Order RI-09-0032/0120) was awarded, resulting in a system-level MHU-204 PoC utilizing off-the-shelf / state-of-the art electronics and hardware.</p>
<p>The full-system produced under contract HC1047-05-D-4005 (Order RI-09-0032/0120) did not result in a production-representative article capable of transitioning into the workforce via depot or third part action. This effort shall result in finalizing the documentation and design of the MHU-204 PoC to ensure production and/or overhaul processes are synchronized, streamlined, and integrated to mitigate risks affecting cost, schedule and performance.</p>
<p>See attached outline and R60514 series reports (7 reports total detailing legacy system requirements, certification and/or test requirements) for additional information to help gage the type of work and contract scope/complexity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND/ DESCRIPTION: The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is conducting market research on behalf of the US Army's Office of the Program Manager, Terrestrial Sensors (PM TS), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities required to perform a technology insertion development effort on the LRAS3. Technology insertion would be accomplished via an ECP to integrate the Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) B-Kit into the current LRAS3.</p>
<p>The LRAS3 is a multi-sensor system that includes a FLIR sensor, a Day Video Camera (DVC), an Eyesafe Laser Rangefinder (ELRF), and a Far Target Location (FTL) capability. The LRAS3 is a long range reconnaissance and surveillance system that provides a real-time target detection, recognition, and identification capability to the cavalry scout while operating 24-hours a day in adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF RQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Responses are for those sources that have the existing capability or plans for a single system integrator that can develop and/or integrate and test the following LRAS3 upgrades or modifications:</p>
<p>1. 3GEN LRAS3 ECP: The intent of the 3GEN LRAS3 ECP upgrade effort is to increase capability and mitigate obsolescence with no changes to the LRAS3 external interfaces (electrical and physical) except where required by the modifications listed below. The 3GEN LRAS3 will meet or exceed the requirements stated in MIL-PRF-A3264477F, in addition to those listed in the below upgrades. The ECP will emphasize reusing as many existing LRAS3 components as possible to minimize cost and risk. <br /><br />a. Integrate 3GEN FLIR B-kit capability that is under separate development by PM Ground Sensors (GS). The 3GEN FLIR B-kit integrates mid-wave and long-wave infrared (IR) imaging and significantly increases Detect, Recognize, and Identify ranges.<br />b. Integrate Military Global Position System (GPS) User Equipment (MGUE) receiver capability that is under separate development by PM Position Navigation and Timing. <br />c. Integrate new Far Target Location (FTL) technology for increased FTL system precision and range. <br />i. The FTL system shall provide target location for targets at ranges up to 25 km within a 60 meter circular error probability (CEP) of 50% (CEP50) [required] and 40 meter CEP [desired].<br />ii. The FTL system shall provide target location for targets at ranges up to 6 km within a 10 meter target location error (TLE) of 90% (TLE90) [desired].<br />d. Integrate a modernized Biocular Display.<br />e. Integrate a new Day Video Camera (DVC), including any necessary optics modifications.<br />f.

<p>BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground - Belvoir (ACCAPG- Belvoir) is conducting market research on behalf of Night Vision &amp; Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) / Program Manager Electro-Optic Infrared Payloads- Force Protection (PdM EOIR Payloads- Force Protection) in<br />accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. NVESD PdM EOIR is looking for companies with the capabilities to provide Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Items (NDI), or near NDI for ground-based radar surveillance systems for detection and tracking of targets of interest such as walking humans, small vehicles, and large vehicles.<br />The Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) is a program of record in Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) as part of the development and acquisition portfolio of the PdM EOIR Payloads- Force Protection, which is a subordinate office of the Project Manager Terrestrial Sensors within the Program Executive<br />Office, Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).<br />The G-BOSS(E) is an expeditionary, ground-based, self-contained, multi-spectral sensor-oriented, persistent surveillance system used to observe, collect, detect, classify, identify, track, record, and report on contacts, objects of interest, and assessed threats twenty-four hours a day using a display of fused video and sensor data.<br />The G-BOSS(E) is used for mid to long range persistent surveillance. This system will be of a size and weight that allows mobility, transportability, scalability, and modularity consistent with deployment and employment using common U.S. air, land and sea transport assets. The G-BOSS(E) will be capable of independent employment or<br />as part of a network base security and defense system.<br />The current specifications for the ground-based surveillance radar sensors are defined in the specification document entitled "Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) [G-BOSS (E)] Radar Subsystem." The document is Distribution D restricted. The document is authorized for use by the U.S. Government Agencies and their U.S. contractors only. The document contains technical data whose export is<br />restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.), as amended. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. These documents will be disseminated in accordance with provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25.</p>
<p>Companies or organizations may request a copy of the document by providing their Point of Contact information listed below to stephen.j.jones50.civ@mail.mil and must clearly state if and how they meet the conditions under which they can receive the documents referenced above. In addition, companies requesting the above information<br />must register for an account with an internet accessible portal known as the Corporate Management System Online (CMS II). Registrants will access the CMS II website (https://www.mycmsportal.com) and follow instructions to complete registration. Documents are currently available for viewing in the CMS II under the W909MY-17-R-A0008 folder so the registrants must specifically request access to only the W909MY-17-R-A008 folder. Access to the W909MY-17-R-A008 folder documents will only be granted upon verification that criteria dictated by Distribution D and export control restrictions are met by registered companies or organizations.</p>

This Project is for the Repair and Repavement Roadways at the VA New Jersey Healthcare System, Lyons Campus, 151 Knollcroft Road, Lyons, NJ  07939-5001.

GENERAL SCOPE 

Provide professional A/E design services for the design of the following Task items listed below. 

During the site investigation and preliminary design portion of the project, the A/E will meet with the Safety Manager of the facility and he will provide the A/E with information concerning safety requirements that will need to be incorporated into the construction specifications.

Task 1   Prepare Drawings & Specification
Furnish professional A/E services for the preparation of specifications and drawings for the repair or replacement of asphalt pavement, and the rebuilding or replacement of catch basins and manholes. A/E shall specify all appurtenances as required to meet the repair or replacement of these items.

The VA has identified areas throughout the medical center that are in need of repair or replacement, the A/E shall consolidate and organize these repair items onto a set of drawings and specification that can be used to solicit competitive construction bid for their repair or replacement. 

The Government estimate for the construction of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  The work is to be performed at the Lyons Campus of the VA New Jersey Healthcare System.  

The A/E services will include various phases of design starting with a site survey and design analysis and following through with working drawings and construction specifications.  A cost estimate shall be required for each design review milestone.  The A/E shall provide the VA with a list of all submittals required of the construction contractor.  Extra efforts are required towards project phasing in order to provide a minimum interruption to the Medical Centers normal activity.
The A/E shall address the need for special protective construction (Pre-construction risk assessments) and methods of work to assure the continued operation of medical center.
The A/E shall develop an appropriate phasing and coordination plan for the construction of the project so as to continue the normal operation of the medical center and assure the safety of patients, visitors, and employees during all construction.
As-built drawings will be verified by the A/E prior to using information contained in these drawings for design.  A/E design shall also include requirements contained in VA standards.  Drawings shall be on standard VA drawing sheets in accordance with VA Construction Standards and VA Standard Details. Construction drawings shall be provided on AutoCAD 2014.  VA Master Construction Specifications will be furnished in MS Word format.  All final construction documents will be submitted to the VA on a CD provided by the A/E.  The A/E will edit the specification specific to this project. All cost estimates shall be on VA Form 10-6238. Cost estimates shall be quantitative based on drawings and specifications, indicating labor and materials for each branch of work and reflecting estimated cost for each item.  Cost estimates shall include 10% for overhead and 10% for profit and an allowance for General Conditions.
The A/E shall develop bid alternates to keep the final construction cost within the approved budget. In order to accomplish this, the final construction documents shall have bid alternates so that the lowest bid alternate is 10% less than the approved construction budget, based on the A/E's final cost estimate.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES

The A/E shall make an on-site inspection of all areas within the scope of the project to familiarize themselves with existing conditions.  The A/E shall verify all dimensions including verification of drawings and information furnished the A/E by the VA. 
Upon appointment by the Director, Facility Management Service Center, the A/E will be assisted by VA Facility Management staff in confirming existing conditions. The VA makes no guarantee as to the accuracy of any as-built drawings or information provided. The A/E must field verify all conditions.
The A/E shall meet with all necessary staff and medical center management in order to determine the Medical Centers requirements.  The A/E shall use this information and provide several planning options to address all requirements.


REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

The following are minimum requirements for review purposes only.  This does not relieve the Engineering Firm of responsibility to produce a complete set of construction documents and estimates in accordance with industry standard practice and VA criteria.
  
The A/E Firm shall prepare and coordinate all engineering and site drawings, calculations, specifications and cost estimates. The degree of completion and stages of submission shall be as specified.
For each submission, the Engineering Firm shall incorporate the corrections, adjustments, and changes made by the VA at the previous review. The A/E Firm shall date all reports, and submission material.
Provide computations and sizing calculations for mechanical, plumbing, and electrical designs. For computerized submissions provide complete and clear documentation with computer programs, interpretations, and detailed description of program procedures.
If subsurface investigation is necessary, submit criteria for the subsurface investigation as well as the qualifications of consultants being considered for the investigation. Start subsurface investigation upon approval of the proposal by the Contracting Officer in writing.
The A/E Firm shall submit a construction cost estimate with the drawings at each project submission. This estimate shall show the cost of construction which would be expected to be reflected by the construction contractors' bids, if the bids were submitted on the same day as the estimate. The level of detail for this estimate shall be consistent with the percentage of completeness of the drawings being submitted.  For detailed elements, "lump sum" or "allowance" figures will not be accepted.

PRELIMINARIES 25% DESIGN REVIEW

Preliminary drawings for construction projects are a means of identifying alternative approaches to correcting physical and functional deficiencies. The development of these drawings is an interactive process between VA staff and the Engineering Firm in order to produce a narrative and graphical description of possible program alternatives. As appropriate, the VA will make available prior to contract negotiations a tentative priority list of functional areas which may be included in the project, and a statement task.
Prior to beginning any design work, a preliminary meeting will be conducted between the A/E Firm and VA staff. At this stage, the scope of work will be finalized and agreed to by all VA services involved in this project. At this point the A/E Firm will have surveyed the existing facility to verify all existing conditions and become familiar with all deficiencies that need to be corrected. The A/E will write minutes of the meeting to the Contracting Officer for distribution and approval by the appropriate staff.
The Engineering Firm in collaboration with VA staff, will illustrate in sketch form various possible program alternatives and refine them based on continuing interaction with the VA project team. The A/E Firm will then complete and present alternative solutions which are functionally and architecturally viable for consideration.  The VA will select the final concept and subsequently identify the approved scope to be developed in the second preliminary (100%) review stage.
The VA considers originality and imaginative design an essential part of the A/E Firm's responsibility. The total environmental approach is a necessity to all planning. Site, structures, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, open and screened areas and their relationships to each other should be combined to produce a plan that is functional and aesthetically pleasing.  
Complete conceptual alternatives must be displayed on the preliminary drawings.  The work may include the division of an alternative into distinct parts, each of which has an identified priority.  The preliminary drawings must, therefore, be developed so that irrespective of which parts (in priority order) are selected for further development in the Working Drawing phase, the solution shall provide a well designed facility with respect to functional operation, construction phasing, minimized disruption of existing hospital operation, and compatibility with structure and utilities between (1) existing facilities; (2) those for imminent construction; and, (3) those with low priority for future construction.
A narrative to accompany the drawings shall identify construction phasing which will be necessary to permit continuous operation of critical hospital operations.  In addition, areas of new construction and renovation shall be shown.  A detailed listing of submission requirements for phasing is included in a later paragraph.
Subsequent to each VA review of the Engineering Firm's work, The A/E Firm shall incorporate VA recommendations into the Preliminary Drawings.
Review meetings will be conducted at the end of each design phase.  Submit five (5) copies of all narratives, drawings, calculations and cost estimates to be reviewed by VA staff.  The cost estimates will reflect the level of completeness at each review stage.  In addition, the A/E Firm shall take minutes of the review meeting and submit two copies to the Contracting Officer for distribution to VA staff.
The first review shall include the following:
Drawings shall be completed to the review percentage.
Demolition work required for each area.
Provide a design analysis for the Bronx VAMC Preliminary Phasing Review.

<DESC>The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.<br />For the Institute to continue fulfilling this vital public health mission, it must foster innovative thinking and ensure that a full array of novel scientific perspectives are used to further discovery in the evolving science of brain, behavior, and experience. In this way, breakthroughs in science can become breakthroughs for all people with mental illnesses.
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health, (NIMH) Office of Fellowship Training, Division of Intramural Research (DIRP), is responsible for the administration of two graduate programs: NIH-Karolinska Institute (KI) and the University College London (UCL)-NIMH Joint Doctoral Program in Neuroscience. The office facilitates the process for eligible candidates to interview and gain acceptance into either of the two doctoral programs. Additionally, the office oversees all of the administrative processes involved with bringing accepted candidates on as fellows using Non-FTE appointment mechanism. The KI and UCL-NIMH programs are designed such that students complete requirements for their Ph.D. degree in four years, spending half their time overseas at KI or UCL pursuing research and the remaining time in an NIMH lab continuing their thesis project. The degree is awarded by UCL or KI.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Acquisition: <br />To fulfill this tuition request, the NIMH requires the following: <br />&bull; Payment of the UCL tuition for 5 students currently enrolled in the graduate training program. <br />The tuition payment for five (5) current students in the University College London (UCL) doctoral program to cover the school year expenses, as a provision of the MOU agreement between NIMH and UCL, NIMH must provide a scholarship for fee support at the permitted level for overseas study by the Federal Government.</p>

<RESPDATE>021317
<CONTACT>Danielle Ventura, Email danielle.l.ventura1@navy.mil
<DESC><p>NUWC Division Newport is seeking information for potential small business sources that possess the technical capability, facilities/equipment and qualifications to manufacture, test, package, and deliver first article and production TR-338D Transducers. <br /><br /><strong>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</strong> It is a market research tool being used to determine potential small businesses capable of providing the products described herein prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP). The contractor must be able to meet the minimum requirements. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>The results of this Sources Sought will be used to determine if a Small Business Set-Aside opportunity exists. All interested small businesses are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>After review of the submitted Sources Sought responses, NUWCDIVNPT will release a Synopsis to Industry regarding the acquisition strategy/decision (i.e. Unrestricted, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Set Aside) prior to release of the Request for Proposal (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be posted in May 2017. The resulting Contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</p>
<p><strong>Background Information:<br /></strong>This procurement is a follow-on to contract N66604-09-D-1040. Contract N66604-09-D-1040 was solicited on an Unrestricted Basis and awarded to Channel Technologies Group (formerly International Transducer Corporation) for TR-338C Transducers. It is public knowledge that CTG has filed for bankruptcy and will no longer be in business.</p>
<p>The TR-338C transducers are transducers which are "top sounders" that project and receive acoustic energy for high resolution echo ranging functions on submarine sonar systems. Historically, the TR-338C transducers have been categorized as "Grade A" devices, but are in the process of being re-categorized as "Grade B" devices in terms of shock test survivability measures and thus the follow-on procurement is anticipated to be procured as such. A "Grade B" device is one whose operation is not essential to the safety and combat capability of the ship, but could become a hazard to ship operations as a result of exposure to shock. The unit is allowed to malfunction as a result of shock, but must remain fully intact due to the possibility of debris causing harm to personnel or other equipment. The potential shock test survivability grade change is significant enough to change the nomenclature of the TR-338 transducer from "C" to "D". This means that the TR-338D transducers must withstand the Underwater Explosive Shock Testing without physical damage but are not required to be operational thereafter. The potential change in shock test survivability categorization is an important factor that the Government expects will open the design space for consideration of alternative types of ceramic, and/or other transduction technology to reduce the program risk currently associated with the legacy TR-338 series design technology (Navy Type IV, Barium Titanate). Note that although legacy TR-338 transducers met the requirements of "Grade A" shock, Barium Titanate became difficult to source reliably. For the upcoming solicitation, the following topics will be included as proposal requirements and are provided here for consideration only. For this Sources Sought, potential bidders need not respond to these topics at this time.</p>
<p>1) The effect of the "Grade B" re-categorization on the TR-338D ceramic design and on other components of the transducer<br />2) Considerations for tuning the TR-338D transducer so that it meets the electroacoustic requirements<br />3) Considerations in designing the ceramic components to meet both narrow and wide beamwidth requirements</p>
<p><strong>Requested Response:</strong> <br />It is requested that interested small businesses respond with a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 3 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font) demonstrating the ability to manufacture the TR-338D Transducer to Danielle Ventura, Contract Specialist, at Danielle.L.Ventura1@navy.mil no later than <strong>1400 EST 02/13/2017.</strong> Questions and comments are highly encouraged and must be submitted by <strong>1400 EST on 02/06/2017</strong>. Absolutely no requests for extensions will be honored. Late responses will not be considered.</p>
<p><strong>The Capability Statement must address, at a minimum, the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 1: Introduction.</strong> Identify the Sources Sought Number and Title</p>
<p><strong>Section 2: Corporate Description.</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Name of Company and address<br />&bull; Confirmation of Company size status under NAICS Code 334511<br />&bull; Ownership, including whether: Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Women-Owned, HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Business<br />&bull; Two points of contact, including: Name, title, phone, and e-mail address <br />&bull; CAGE Code and DUNS Number</p>
<p><strong>Section 3: Past/Current Performance.</strong> Provide two (2) examples of prior/current corporate experience providing similar technical capability within the last three years if possible. If recent experience isn't available please include any related experience and indicate how it pertains to the requirement for TR-338D Transducers. For all examples, include contract number, organization supported, indication of whether as a prime or subcontractor, contract values, Government point of contact with current telephone number, and a brief description of how the referenced contract relates to production of TR-338D Transducers.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4: Technical Response.</strong></p>
<p>Each potential offeror shall provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Statement regarding contractor's capability to obtain a facility clearance at the confidential level.<br />&bull; Statement regarding capability to obtain the required industrial security clearances for personnel.<br />&bull; Contractor's expected period of performance from contract award to delivery of first article and production TR-338D transducers.<br />&bull; Description of the test facilities and equipment to which the contractor has access in order to meet the procurement requirements. If the potential offeror does not own its facilities and equipment, the offeror shall provide evidence that it will have a commitment or an arrangement to rent, purchase or otherwise acquire the needed facilities and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Attachments:<br />Attachment #1:</strong> Draft Statement of Work<br /><strong>Attachment #2:</strong> TR-338C Transducer Critical Item Performance Specification (CIPS)<br /><strong>Attachment #3:</strong> TR-338C Transducer top level drawing package (for reference only)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above attachments should be considered drafts and are subject to change.</p>

<DESC>Request for Expression of Interest, Armored Vehicles Purchase
<p>To whom it may concern, <br />On behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) anticipates future requirements for the purchase of right and left hand drive vehicles with protective armoring, to be deployed outside of the United States. Vehicle types consist of light-weight pickup trucks, small SUVS, and a variety of other utility type vehicles. In order to support the weight of the armoring, while minimizing payload impacts, the suspensions are required to be modified and composite light weight armoring must be utilized to the extent possible. Exterior body panels and glass must be armored in a manner which does not adversely alter the original exterior factory appearance.<br />PNNL is conducting market research to identify armoring companies who are capable of providing the below outlined services. Capable firms should respond by addressing each of the following five (5) requirements: <br />1. Capable of armoring vehicles with a B6 ballistic protection level. Provide the appropriate certifications documenting ballistics testing,<br />2. Capable of providing light-weight composite armoring, also rated for the B6 ballistic protection level with certifications documenting ballistics testing (Please provide an indication as to the per square foot weight of steel and composite armoring materials),<br />3. Experience purchasing multiple vehicles in foreign countries,<br />4. Experience conducting armoring operations outside the U.S., <br />5. Experience shipping armored vehicles outside the U.S. <br />Interested parties capable of providing armored vehicles meeting these general requirements, should submit a summary of their capabilities with respect to the items noted above. This summary should include but is not limited to: established marketing documents, product specifications documenting capabilities, unit weights (e.g., pounds per square foot) of the steel or composite armoring materials employed in armoring and a list specifying vehicle makes and models previously armored.<br />Please submit your response no later than February 3, 2017 to the attention of Gene Stott, Sr. Contract Specialist, at gene.stott@pnnl.gov.</p>

<DESC>This notice invites industry to participate in an Industry Day to communicate an overview of the Design-Bid-Build efforts needed for the USDA/ARS Agricultural Research Technology Center Modernization Project. The Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, has a requirement for Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B) Services. <br /><br />The mission of the Crop Improvement and Protection Research Unit at Salinas, CA is to improve germplasm of sugarbeet, lettuce, celery, spinach and melon, determine basic biology of viral, fungal and bacterial diseases affecting these crops, develop alternatives to methyl bromide as a soil fumigant for control of soilborne pests in strawberry and vegetables, reduce post-harvest losses of lettuce, develop scientifically based organic crop production practices, develop methods for control of weeds, and improve artichoke production practices including insect and disease control.
<p>The existing facilities at ARTC are inadequate for addressing its expanding research program. The four wood framed laboratory/office buildings constructed in the 1940s are deficient in interior air quality, and in meeting current seismic safety engineering, mechanical, electrical and building code standards. A fully completed design for the D-B-B project was completed in 2007 but the project had to be delayed because of funding issues. The design drawings and specifications are currently being updated by an AE firm to meet current building codes and regulations. The estimated cost of construction (ECC) for the three phases are still being updated. It is ARS intention to have this construction project certified as LEED Silver.<br /><br />The project scope includes the demolition of outdated buildings and constructing new facilities in 3 phases as shown below:</p>
<p>Phase 1 - West Lab/Office, 31,600 GSF, ECC &gt;$20M<br />Phase 2 - East Lab/Office, 39,400 GSF, ECC &gt;$20M<br />Phase 3 - Headhouse/Greenhouse, 37,000 GSF, ECC &gt;$15M</p>
<p>Industry Day will be held from 9:00 AM PST to approximately 12:00 PM CST on 31 January 2017 at the USDA Agricultural Research Service, 1636 E. Alisal St, Salinas, CA 93905 in the main conference room. All attendees are required to bring a Government issued ID to check into security. Onsite parking is available.</p>

<p>CLASS JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 41U.S.C.3304{a)(7)</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1,the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity:<br />The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), proposes to enter into six (6) or more contracts on a basis other than full and open competition with commercial mobile home parks.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action being Approved:<br />a. Type of action: Firm Fixed-Price Contracts<br />b. Amount: Not-To-Exceed $8,000,000.00<br />c. Type of funding: Disaster Relief Fund<br />d. Year of funding: FY 2016 and FY2017<br />e. All mobile home parks will be located in the State of Louisiana</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services:<br />Section 408 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Pub.<br />L. No. 93-288, as amended {the "Stafford Act"), codified at 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq., authorizes FEMA to provide manufactured housing units (MHUs), acquired by purchase or lease, directly to individuals or households, who, as a result of a major disaster, lack available housing resources and would be unable to make use of financial assistance. Direct assistance may be provided for a period of up to 18 months from the date of a Presidentially-declared major disasters. In response to the Louisiana Severe Storms and Flooding DR-4277, the state received a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration on 14 August 2016 {DR-4277-LA). The Governor requested a direct housing program under the Housing Assistance Provision of the Individuals and Households Program (42 U.S.C 5174 (c)(l)(B)) under FEMA DR-4277-LA on 24 August 2016. Based on the damage resulting from the incident, FEMA has determined a lack of available housing resources exist in and around the declared area, and authorized temporary direct housing assistance for eligible applicants on 1September 2016. The contracts covered under this Class J&amp;A are for the rental of pad sites at various commercial mobile home parks and campgrounds located in the declared counties. The total combined value of all contracts issued under this class justification will not exceed $8 million. In addition to the monthly rent of the pad site {including utilities), the price of each contract may<br />include expanding and improving commercial sites including upgrading utility services, to develop usable pad sites for MHU placement. The period of performance for each<br /><br />contract will be for a base period ofthree (3) months with four 3-month options, for a total of 15 months to cover possible extensions beyond the 18-month program.</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(2), implemented by the FAR Subpart 6.302-2 entitled "Authority is FAR 6.302- 2,unusual and compelling urgency."</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: FEMA's Disaster Housing Assessment Teams (DHAT) is responsible for working with the State's housing department to locate all commercial mobile home parks and campgrounds in the declared counties. The DHATs then visit each site to perform<br />feasibility assessments to determine if FEMA MHUs can be placed on site. When considering the placement of MHUs, FEMA must follow the abbreviated eight-step decision process for sites as outlined in 44 CFR Section 9.13, which states that no mobile home may be placed on a floodplain. Close coordination with the Environmental Planning and Historic Preservation Program and Hazard Mitigation is also required. In addition, each site must be capable of accepting 1,2 or 3 bedroom units of various sizes and must be utility-ready or able to have utilities upgraded to meet the specifications of FEMA's MHUs. For DR-4277-LA, there are currently only four approved parishes: East Baton Rouge Parish, Livingston Parish,Ascension Parish, Tangipahoa Parish and DHAT<br />identified a total of 2 sites in East Baton Rouge Parish,2 Sites in Livingston Parish, 1site in Ascension Parish and 1site in Tangipahoa Parish.<br />&bull; East Baton Rouge Parish<br />o 8 are not feasible for the following reasons:<br />&bull; Management could not be located/contacted<br />&bull; No lots available<br />&bull; In Flood Zone<br />&bull; Does not want to do business with FEMA<br />o 2 sites are also feasible pending additional inspections. It is anticipated that FEMA would contract with one or more of these 8 sites, depending on survivors' need<br />&bull; Livingston Parish<br />o 2 sites are feasible pending additional inspections. It is anticipated that FEMA would contract with one or more of these 2 sites, depending on survivors' need<br />&bull; Ascension Parish<br />o 4 are not feasible for the following reasons:<br />&bull; In flood zone<br />&bull; Management could not be located<br />&bull; No pads available<br />1site is feasible pending additional inspection. It is anticipated that FEMA would contract with one or more of these 4 sites, depending on survivors' need<br /><br />&bull; Tangipahoa Parish<br />o 2 are not feasible for the following reasons:<br />&bull; Management could not be located<br />&bull; No pads available<br />&bull; Sites no longer exist<br />1site is feasible pending additional inspections. It is anticipated that FEMA would contract with one or more of these 6 sites, depending on survivors' need</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Is Practicable:<br />In addition to the site assessments described in the section above,the Contracting Officer did not post a Sources Sought notification due to Authority is FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government<br />will be Fair and Reasonable:<br />The contracting officer determines that the anticipated prices will be fair and reasonable based on market research, current price lists, and comparison with similar items. Fair Market Rent (FMR} is defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD} and are primarily used to determine payment standard amount for various housing assistance programs. FMRs are gross rent estimates that include the cost of<br />rent plus all tenant-paid utilities, except telephones, cable or satellite television service, and internet service. HUD uses the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates every fiscal year. FMRs are intended to be housing market-wide rent estimates that provide housing opportunities throughout the geographic area in which rental units are in direct competition. HUD publishes FMRs in the Federal Register, first as proposed estimates for public comment and then for final effect. The purpose of the public comments process is to identify areas where local government officials or residents believe the FMRs are too high or too low. All pad lease payments must be in line with the FMR for that specific county. Fair market rent for East Baton Rouge parish, Livingston parish,Ascension parish and Tangipahoa parishes varies from a low of $728 for a 1-bedroom and a high of $1,056 for a 3-bedroom.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research: See paragraphs 5 and 6.</p>
<p>9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: See paragraph 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Page 3 of s<br /><br />10. A Listing of the Sources, if Any That Express, in Writing,an Interest in the Acquisition: Potential Commercial Site Locations were determi ned and identified based on the locations, need, impacted populat ion and the availability of pads.</p>
<p>11. A Statement of the Action, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services is Required:<br />FEMA will continue to perform casework, in coordination with the Individual Assistance Division, to maximize the use of available existing housing resources based on a reasonable commuting distance of 50 miles. This will be performed for each household on basis prior to being determined to have a continued need for direct housing assistance. FEMA, in coordination with the State of Louisiana, will work with applicants to identify and achieve a permanent housing plan. If necessary,because of extraordinary circumstances, at the written request of the State, FEMA may extend the<br />18 month period of assistance for temporary direct housing assistance if an extension in the public's interest. FEMA will assess penalty fees for occupants who remain in or maintain possession of the MHU after the end of the approved period of assistance in accordance with 44 C.F.R Section 206.117(b)(l)(ii)(H).</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification:<br />Icertify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. Technical/Requirements Personnel Certification:<br />Icertify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, intends to issue a sole source contract to Corys Thunder, Inc. of Jacksonville, FL for an update for the Corys TESS, MATRIX 3D simulation and modeling system software that operates FRA's Cab Technology Integration Lab (CTIL). <br /><br />The justification is as follows. Corys Thunder, Inc. is the system integrator for the FRA's CTIL. The system software that operates the CTIL is a proprietary product of Corys Thunder. The acquisition will be to update the software to include track routes of the Northeast Corridor from Wilmington, DE to New York, NY. This will enhance and expand the CTIL track database. Corys Thunder will obtain the applicable Northeast Corridor rail track layout data and modify track data to be compatible with the Corys software residing on the FRA's CTIL. <br /><br />FRA previously acquired the Corys TESS, MATRIX 3D simulation and modeling system to ensure that the CTIL simulation lab would be compatible with the larger contingency of railroad operators also using the Corys system. This approach facilitates future research efforts with the rail industry and allows for software resources to be shared. The proprietary nature of the Corys system makes use of any other simulator software system incompatible. Proprietary development of simulators is a standard in the simulator manufacturing industry.<br /><br />NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ryan Daniels, at ryan.daniels@dot.gov

<SOLNBR>DTFR5317RD00002
<RESPDATE>012717
<CONTACT>Ryan T. Daniels, Email ryan.daniels@dot.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source contract to BancLab of New York, New York for Railroad Credit Assessment and Portfolio Management System Support for the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program.<br /><br />The justification is as follows. BancLab is the only source able to provide the services. The additional work to be performed is closely related&nbsp;to services currently performed by the contractor.&nbsp;BancLab uses RCAPM software for the current RRIF support services it performs for FRA. This new effort, like the current effort, also&nbsp;requires the use of the RCAPM software, proprietary software created by the contractor and modified by the contractor in response to continuing OMB requirements. No other software is suitable to perform the work, as it is specialized for the RRIF program because of the unique credit risk premium requirements and how re-estimates are calculated. Furthermore, coordination and use of the software by another contractor would, at the least, require significant additional time and resources to perform the work. For example, BancLab would need to initially train another contractor to use and understand the data processed by the software, as well as provide continuous additional training to that other contractor in response to changes required of RCAPM. <br /><br />Lastly, the new work itself is part of broader RRIF reporting services the contractor is currently performing. This new work is the other portion of the requirement, work that will no longer be required of FRA past September 30, 2017. Accordingly, even if another contractor was to be brought on-board, the services are no longer of a recurring nature and the time delay required to bring another contractor up to speed would make award moot. Additionally, performance of these related services by a single contractor ensures that the entirety of the work and the work product is done in a single standardized and congruent manner that does not require expenditure of additional time and resources by FRA to reconcile multiple contractors' deliverables.<br /><br />NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><br />BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT<br />INTENT TO ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT &amp; PARTNERSHIP INTERMEDIARY SUPPORT<br />FOR THE NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER AIRCRAFT DIVISION</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***Please note the BAA Validity Period as outlined in Section 5 of this BAA***</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAVAIRWARCENACDIV) is soliciting white papers from organizations designated as partnership intermediaries, as defined in 15 U.S Code &sect; 3715 - USE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERMEDIARIES, to assist in technology transfer efforts.<br />The technical and research white paper should include concepts and activities that will lead to increased NAVAIRWARCENACDIV collaborations with external partners, including universities, industry consortia, economic development entities, and State and local governments. These white papers should lead to improved utilization of federal technologies developed at NAVAIRWARCENACDIV and/or perform services that increase the likelihood of success in the conduct of cooperative or joint activities with small business firms, institutions of higher education, and industry.</p>
<p>The desired goal is to make the most of the R&amp;D budget and the expertise of both government and nongovernment scientists and engineers, increase the return on investment of the federal R&amp;D budget, and help NAVAIRWARCENACDIV meet mission requirements while enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the world economy.</p>
<p><br />2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, presidents, Congress, and federal agencies have worked together to establish a policy framework that enables the federal government to transfer its technology to the nonfederal sector, which includes industry, state and local governments, and academic institutions. The bidirectional sharing between federal laboratories and private industry includes not only technologies, but personnel, facilities, methods, expertise, and technical information in general. Through this technology transfer process, federal laboratories share the benefits of the national investment in research and development (R&amp;D) with all segments of society. These types of interactions create high growth entrepreneurship, foster innovation by increasing the rate of technology transfer and the economic and societal impact from Federal research and development (R&amp;D) investments. Technology Transfer at NAVAIRWARCENACDIV is bi-directional. We are constantly seeking game-changing technologies no matter where these technologies are developed. When we find innovations that originated in the private sector or within academia, we work to connect those technologies to the Navy labs and to the Department of Defense. We refer to this as "spinning-in" technology.</p>
<p>3. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>To establish and operate an unclassified facility where Government, Labs, Industry, and Academia can collaborate. In doing so, this will create the requisite forum for accelerating delivery of innovative capabilities to NAVAIRWARCENACDIV. This will also facilitate capability refinement through technology exploration and experimentation in addition to assessing existing technologies that hold promise.</p>
<p>Activities to be performed by the Partnership Intermediary shall include:</p>
<p>1. Evaluating potential technologies that enhance NAVAIRWARCENACDIV's fulfillment of its strategic objectives and near-term operational needs.</p>
<p>2. Assist vendors in prototyping, experimentation, and demonstration of these technologies in lab facilities and surrogate vehicles where possible.</p>
<p>3. Develop and execute strategies for effectively working with State and local agencies, federal government agencies, academia, entrepreneurs, and international partners to leverage technologies and resources.</p>
<p>4. Working within the technology ecosystem to assemble, host, and facilitate meetings, forums, and collaborative group's between NAVAIRWARCENACDIV and other organizations such as universities, national labs, and industry leaders in research, development, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>5. Establish a network for accessing various prototyping capabilities to include welding, machining, metal Additive Manufacturing ("AM"), large scale AM, and composite fabrication.</p>
<p>6. Coordinate subject matter expert (SME) participants for technology talks, innovation forums, and collaboration events to enhance its existing network.</p>
<p>7. Encourage industry collaborative investment of leveraged research resources in areas of basic research and exploratory and advanced development, identified as having high potential for defense and non-defense commercialization, and by involving eminent researchers in the pursuit and development of products for commercial markets.</p>
<p>8. Identify promising technologies that currently exist or are in the developmental phase at NAVAIRWARCENACDIV that could be efficiently and cost effectively transitioned to the U.S. warfighter.</p>
<p>9. Provide manufacturing, design, and business assistance to NAVAIRWARCENACDIV licensees for the purpose of successfully transitioning the technology to commercialization. This could include efforts such as assisting in developing marketing plans and connecting companies to venture capital or other resources.</p>
<p>10. Assist in the commercialization of NAVAIRWARCENACDIV intellectual property to the commercial sector.</p>
<p>The Intermediaries facility shall be a state-of-the-art venue and provide for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Meeting space with seating for groups of 25-50 people (steady state) and available space for rent to support large groups &gt;150 people (adjacent to the facility would be ideal).<br />&bull; Accommodate 4-10 breakout rooms.<br />&bull; State of the art audiovisual equipment including microphones, digital white boards, smart boards, projectors w/screen, and internet connectivity.<br />&bull; The entire facility will be equipped with hi-speed wireless and configurable collaboration tools (to include break out rooms).<br />&bull; Organic event management and established relationships with professional large event planners for larger forums.<br />&bull; Capability to record both audio and video wrap-up sessions.</p>
<p><br />The location shall be within 10 miles of the NAS Patuxent River, MD.</p>
<p><br />4. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE</p>
<p>NAVAIRWARCENACDIV will consider various types of acquisition vehicles including but not limited to traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts or other non-procurement agreements. The Government will negotiate the most appropriate acquisition type.</p>
<p>Note: Typically, research and technical activities result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract/Agreement modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility. In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract and/or agreement. Therefore, the resulting acquisition vehicle will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>
<p>5. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>No request for proposal (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. The initial rounds of white papers are requested by close of business on 17 FEB 2017. White Papers submitted after this date through one (1) year from the original posting date of this BAA in FEDBIZOPPS may be considered. Offerors shall submit white papers that will represent a comprehensive coverage of the proposed areas of interest stated in Section 3 of this BAA. The Government will not respond to requests for oral discussions of potential research or technical offerings.</p>

Where a Contract vehicle is contemplated, the Government will require the aforementioned elements before a Contract award, to assess cost realism and reasonableness.</p>
<p>7. AWARDS</p>
<p>NAVAIRWARCENACDIV is planning to make one or more awards within the overall objectives stated in this BAA. All awards will be based on the individual merit of the white paper. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the white papers received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each white paper will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. Access and use of NAVAIR facilities will require security clearances and US citizenship.</p>

The construction is a slab to ceiling renovation that will require the demolition of  the internal office walls completely in offices 5A326, 5A326A, 5A311, 5A309, 5A233, 5A231, 5A226, 5A228, 5A230, 5A305, 5A303, 5A215, 5A213 and 5A331 with adjoining un-numbered small rooms.  Partial demolition of the walls of rooms 5A222, 5A224, 5A329, 5A327, 5A419 and 5A417 will be required.  Offices 5A214, 5A216, 5A302, 5A304 and 5A306 shall be divided by constructing new walls.  5A300 shall be enclosed with an entry door.  The deliverable documentation and drawings shall include the removal of walls and the design for the new walls and doors. New walls shall be noted to include electrical installation of outlets and light switches.

2.	The A+E shall identify the electrical circuits that will be demolished from the walls.  The design shall notate the circuit numbers and the locations of the service panels on the drawings for use of demo and reconstruction of the new area.  The deliverable drawings and documentation shall include identifying circuitry that will be abandoned and providing the design for the power that will support the new systems furniture.  The drawings shall indicate the location of new wall outlets.

3.	The deliverable drawings and documentation shall include the new switching schedule for lighting.  The existing light fixtures and occupancy sensors will need rewired and switched to support the all new areas.  No addition of light fixtures is anticipated but if a newly constructed wall shall terminate on a light fixture in the ceiling it shall be noted to be removed from service with the appropriate ceiling repair.  

4.	The new deliverable drawings and documentation shall include sprinkler modifications and life safety modifications as needed for the reconstructed area.  

5.	Provide an Asbestos Abatement Plan for the project.  The current mastic and floor tile under the carpet tiles are known to contain asbestos.

6.	Perform a study on the existing hard ceiling currently in place in the area where the overall construction project will be performed.  The area is approximately 10,000 square feet.  The renovation proposes to demolish the walls of approximately 20 internal offices.  This study must include a thorough physical investigation / inspection above the ceiling by a licensed structural engineer to inspect the integrity of the support system.  The concern of the government is that if the walls of the inner offices are demolished will it have an impact on the structural integrity of the ceiling?  If the demolition does impact the structural integrity of the ceiling then the requirement for the A+E is to provide the design for a method of reinforcement to the hard ceiling.  If it is not able to be reinforced then see option 1 below for direction.  

Option 1 - If it is deemed that keeping the hard ceiling is not in the Governments best interested based upon structural concerns or if keeping the hard ceiling will actually increase the cost to perform the project then an alternate construction of a new drop ceiling shall be provided.  If this method is proposed and exercised by the Government then the A+E shall provide a design to include the drop ceiling system, sprinkler modifications, lighting alterations, electrical modifications, HVAC supply and return alterations, life safety device locations and all changes necessary to successfully complete the renovation project.  If this option is executed than the A+E shall author a Technical Statement of Work for the Government to use to perform the task of replacing the ceiling and executing the entire renovation project.
  
-Code Compliance: The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with the most recent National Electrical Code (NEC), National Fire Protection Association, and Virginia Uniform State-wide Building Code as applicable to commercial and institutional facilities.

-Sustainability: consult USGS Sustainability Construction Checklist for incorporating sustainability into the design. 

The USGS is requesting Contractor Capability Statements at this time. All A&E firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following criteria: (1) professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) capacity to accomplish the work in the required time: (4) past performance on similar contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.

<p><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span>3. Description of Supplies/Services: Procure and install Advantor ACS components and upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. Authority Cited: 10U.S.C 2304(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, Advantor, is the "Original Equipment Distributor" for this purchase. Therefore they are the sole source facility to provide this type of equipment, giving the Federal Government unmatched quality and pricing.</p>

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. 
(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Arrowhead Scientific Inc., Arrowhead Forensic Products, 11030 Strang Line Rd. Lenexa KS 66215. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.<br />This notice will be distributed through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 423410 Photographic Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers; the size standard is 100 employees. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p><br />The FBI Latent Print Operations Unit (LPOU) mission is to conduct timely, high quality scientific examinations in the area of friction ridge analysis; report findings; provide expert testimony relating to these examinations in legal proceedings; provide training to the law enforcement community; and provide forensic field support to the law enforcement community on a national and international level. In order to perform its mission, the LPOU must be able to properly process evidence and capture detected prints in a timely manner, which can only be done with the proper equipment. Many types of evidence are processed with several different techniques in order to detect prints. As prints are detected, they require capture using photography, which can be done using the Full Spectrum Imaging System (FSIS). This system and its accessories are specifically adapted to be used in conjunction with the current FSIS already in use by the LPOU. The procurement of an additional FSIS with compatible accessories will provide increased optimization of use in house and during deployment.</p>
<p>Market research has determined that there is the potential for other similar systems but the LPOU has a specific need for the FSIS, color, and Arrowhead Scientific Inc. Is the only vendor able to provide it with the listed related accessories, therefore these specific products can only be provided by Arrowhead Scientific Inc.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 5:00PM EST, 23 January 2017, by e-mail to the attention of Eliana York, Contracting Officer, at eliana.york@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>A justification and Approval (J&amp;A) supporting this procurement is available upon request.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM effective 29 July, 2012, to be eligible to receive a Government contract. The FBI is utilizing a new financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. If any current FBI vendor data conflicts with SAM data, the information contained in SAM may override the Bureau current information. The Offeror's information in SAM must be updated and accurate, and shall include Tax ID#, EFT, DUNS#, address and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be used to process payment to vendors.</p>

This solicitation: No. N02CO72518-24 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-95 (January 2017) simplified procedures for commercial items. <br />This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.

<p>Every year the NCI prepares an annual plan and budget proposal (known as the "Bypass Budget" or "Bypass") for future fiscal years that is provided to the President and the public. Traditionally this is a request for a budget two years in the future. The major audiences for this document include the administration, congress, and the advocacy community. Beginning in Quarter 4, 2016, CRS in collaboration with the Office of Communications and Public Liaison has begun planning and preparing the FY 2019 Bypass Budget to be released in September of 2017.

<p>Task 1 Information Gathering and Content Review<br />The engagement would start with an information gathering stage wherein the Contractor would collect, review, and synthesize information related to the Bypass Budget (including past versions). In addition, the contractor would talk to key stakeholder offices at the NCI (approximately 5-7) related to document preparation and use, as well as develop an understanding of how the organization would like to implement the Bypass in future years. All this background information would be used to develop the training approach described in Task 2.</p>

Communication methods being taught should be grounded in scientific research (such as from the fields of neurology, psychology, social sciences, etc.) for how to engage, inspire, and effectively communicate with people. This training should focus on print media related products. The sessions would include identifying priority audiences, identifying communications challenges, and setting clear objectives. The training will be held at an NCI location.</p>
<p>Deliverable after sessions: Within two weeks of completing training, a memo should be submitted that includes strategic takeaways and ideas for an aspirational narrative that could be further developed.</p>

The Government is not required to provide responses to vendor's inquiries or correspondence.</p>
<p>2)	Quote Preparation</p>
<p>The following instructions apply for the submission of quotes:</p>
<p>a.	Quotes shall be submitted in three separate volumes:<br /> <br /> Volume I - Technical <br /> Volume II - Past Performance<br /> Volume III - Price</p>
<p>b.	The technical volume shall NOT contain any reference to price.  It is incumbent upon the vendor to provide a technical volume in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that includes, but is not limited to, the technical requirements of the RFQ.</p>
<p>c.	The Government will evaluate quotes in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in FAR 52.212-2 of this RFQ.</p>
<p>3)	Quote Instructions</p>
<p>a.	Technical: Each vendor shall submit a technical submission. The technical submission should be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete so as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the offeror has a thorough understanding of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW).  Quotes which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's SOW or merely state that requirements are understood and will be complied with, which paraphrase the specification document, the SOW or parts thereof, or use phrases such as "standard engineering practices will be employed", or "well established techniques will be employed", etc., may be considered unacceptable  The technical submission shall include the following:</p>
<p>i.	Management Approach (10 page limit): The technical excellence and management capability of the quoter.  This may be expressed as the quoter's proposed approach or methodology to performing the work required in the RFQ.  This criterion measures how well the quoter's proposal presents an efficient and realistic approach to fulfilling the contract's requirements.  It also measures how likely the quoter's proposed organization and management will be successful in performing the work.</p>
<p>ii.	Staffing Approach (10 page limit): The quoter shall provide a general staffing approach for utilization of the quoter's personnel resources that demonstrates an understanding of the skill sets required to successfully accomplish the tasks of the SOW.  The offeror shall describe the quantity and type of personnel to be used and provided qualification and experience to be used on this project.  The staffing approach should demonstrate the quoter's ability to meet the minimum requirements of the SOW throughout the performance of the contract.  In addition, the staffing approach must highlight the availability of manpower to meet the demands of the multiple task orders at once and define the task order management support.  In addition, the offeror shall provide proof of its ability to provide an FAA designated engineering representative (DER) as described in the SOW, to include the number of FAA DERs on staff or readily available.</p>
<p>iii.	Structural Analysis (10 page limit): Demonstrate experience in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and classic hand analysis, to include evidence of the quality, relevancy (including accepted aviation practices and FAA approved methods), and recency of the offeror's experience.</p>
<p>b.	Past Performance:<br />Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the vendor to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation. Vendors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm's most recently completed contracts/orders (not to exceed five (5) years since completion) for like or similar work. Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Each Vendor shall submit, in writing, information on past performance. Vendors shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation. The Vendor is required to send Attachment 02, Past Performance Questionnaire, to those government and commercial activities provided by the vendor's in their submission.  The information shall be completed by the references who will then forward the completed questionnaires:</p>
<p>James Rall<br /> james.rall@noaa.gov (Cc andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov) <br /> U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/EAD</p>
<p>The Government will not accept Questionnaires directly from the vendors, only Questionnaires submitted on time and from vendor's references will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation based upon the past performance of the vendor as it relates to the probability of vendor to provide the Government with quality service as covered within the solicitation.</p>
<p>Vendors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government. The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry. This information may include Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity System (FAPIIS), or past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The burden of providing thorough, complete, and relevant past performance information rests with the vendor.  Any Past Performance Questionnaire(s) received at the Government office designated herein after the exact time specified for receipt of past performance information is "late" and may not be considered for evaluation.  If the vendor possess no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state so in the quote.</p>
<p>Vendors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. However, the submission with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful submission when compared to the submissions of other Vendors having an satisfactory (or better) past performance.</p>
<p>c.	Price: The vendor shall submit all information required for the line items included within this solicitation.  The quoted prices for the line items will be added together and used for evaluation purposes to determine the best value to the government over the base year, inclusive with each subsequent option year, over the life of the contract. The quoted prices will also be used to determine reasonableness.<br /> <br />52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Oct 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&bull;	Technical <br />&bull;	Past Performance</p>
<p>Technical is the most important factor.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not award at significantly higher prices to only achieve slightly better performance. The Government will assess the benefits or better performance versus the added price through trade-off analysis. As non-price factors become equal-price becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<br />Synopsis: Multiple Award IDIQ Term Contract for General Constriction Repair and Alteration Services at the<br />East Field Office.</div>
<p>MOL: $2,000,000.00</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) MidAtlantic<br />Region intends to solicit proposals for a new Indefinite<br />Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award term contract for general construction repair and alteration<br />services between $100.00 and $50,000.00.</p>
<p>Performance Location: Region 3 East Field Office, including Government owned and leased facilities located throughout Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&#894; Camden County, New Jersey&#894; Burlington County, New Jersey&#894; The City of Trenton, New Jersey&#894; Kent County, Delaware&#894; and New Castle County, Delaware.</p>
<p>General Description of Scope of Services:<br />This contract is to provide repair and alteration construction services. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) with a small business size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>The individual task orders to be placed under the contract will range in the dollar value of $100.00 to $50,000.00.</p>
<p>The Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) shall be $2,000,000.00 aggregate for all task orders for the entire term of the contract. The $2,000,000.00 will not be separated equally per awardee. Each contractor on the IDIQ will be able to bid on any task order, regardless of how much work has been completed previously by the contractor on the IDIQ. The minimum guarantee for this contract is $2,500.00 per contractor for the base year. There is no guaranteed minimum for any option years.</p>
<p>Offerors will be required to provide a letter from their bonding company with their proposal submission demonstrating their bonding capacity of at least $35,000.00 to $50,000.00 per single project. This contract will be solicited as a one (1) year base contract with four (4) one (1) year option periods, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. This contract vehicle will be utilized by the Region 3 East Field Office including Government owned and leased facilities located throughout Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&#894; Camden County, New Jersey&#894; Burlington County, New Jersey&#894; The City of Trenton, New Jersey&#894; Kent County, Delaware&#894; and New Castle County, Delaware. Services will be required under these contracts on an as-needed basis. Task orders will be prepared based on line item pricing provided by the awarded offerors.</p>
<p>The government's intent is to award to approximately (6) six offerors who submit proposals which will provide the best value to the government in terms of technical qualifications and price. The Government intends to make award without discussion. Therefore, offerors are requested to submit their initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms based on technical and price factors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.<br /><br />This procurement is a Total Small Business SetAside, with one contract reserved for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns. In accordance with FAR 19.5024(1) and Section 1331 of Public Law 111240 (15 U.S.C. 644(r)) the Contracting Officer has elected to reserve one (1) contract for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns.<br /><br />The government has the right to award more than one contract to any of the concerns if it is determined they represent the best value to the government in accordance with the source selection criteria. The government will only meet this concern if a proposal is received from a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concern is responsive, responsible, and received an overall technical score of "Acceptable" or greater and represents a fair and reasonable price. If it is determined that no SDVOSB offeror proposes an acceptable proposal at fair and reasonable price, a SDVOSB concern will not be recommended for an award and the government is no longer bound to make an award to this concern.<br /><br />Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals. The selected firms will be competitively chosen in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value tradeoff process. For this contract technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than<br />price. A solicitation will be issued requesting offerors to submit in writing both a technical and a price proposal by the offer due date and time. Responsive offers will be evaluated on technical capability and price. The award will be made to the firm that represents the best value to the government. In accordance with FAR 15.404, price<br />analysis will be used to determine price reasonableness and the offerorr's understanding of the work requirements (i.e. unreasonably high prices, as compared to other offers received and the Government Estimate, may indicate the offeror does not comprehend the requirements of the RFP) and the ability to perform the contract.<br /><br />The complete solicitation package will only be available electronically on the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov).<br /><br />It will be available on or about January 3, 2017. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential Offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material. Firms must also be registered with System for Award Management www.sam.gov. For additional information, visit the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov or the SAM website, www.sam.gov. Offerors MUST be registered in the Contractor's Central Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement. The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov. Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a webbased<br />system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. The website for ORCA is http://orca.bpn.gov. Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing either by email to the attention of Sam Bohne<br />(Samantha.bohne@gsa.gov (215) 4462863) or Dan Langan (Daniel.langan@gsa.gov).</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken.

<p>8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT<br />(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.<br />(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and<br />(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).<br />(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman, Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to erik.m.agueros@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The U.S. Agency for International Development, Bureau for Global Health, Office of HIV/AIDS (USAID/GH/OHA) is seeking services for the provision of technical assistance (TA) to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Expenditure Analysis (EA) Initiative's implementation process, improve expenditure data quality, and strengthen the use of expenditure analysis data for program planning and budgeting.<br /><br /> Expenditure Analysis is the routine financial monitoring of the PEPFAR portfolio. The purpose of EA is to better understand the expenses the U.S. Government (USG) incurs to provide a broad range of HIV/AIDS services. It improves the accountability and oversight of PEPFAR's contribution globally by tracking spending and accomplishments over time, as well as supports the strategic planning process with country government counterparts and other key stakeholders.<br /><br />USAID is seeking proposals from qualified Contractors to provide the services as described in Section C of the attached RFP. This is a 100% small business set-aside, under NAICS Code: 541690.<br /><br />In support of the United States President&rsquo;s Emergency Plans for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 3.0, the Efficiency Action Agenda&rsquo;s goal to increase transparency, oversight, and accountability across PEPFAR and its interagency partners, PEPFAR pioneered the use of results-linked financial indicators (expenditures) through its Expenditure Analysis (EA) Initiative, to support financial data for decision making. Use of financial data for decision making has become a cornerstone for PEPFAR. The Implementation of the PEPFAR EA progressed through extensive piloting and phased approaches. <br />Interested Offerors must submit separate technical and cost proposals that comply with the requirements of Section L of this solicitation. USAID plans to award a Cost-plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) term type contract for a performance period as stated in the attached RFP, subject to the availability of funds.</p>

Any amendments to this solicitation will be posted on<a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> </span></a><a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="color: #00008e;">www.fbo.gov</span></a><span style="color: blue;">. </span>It is the responsibility of the prospective offerors to ensure that the solicitation and all amendments are downloaded in entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.<br /><br />Please pay careful attention to Section K - Representations, Certifications and Acknowledgements of the accompanying Request for Proposals. Offerors are expected to comply with FAR clause 52.204-7, System for Award Management (SAM), and complete the representations and certifications electronically in the SAM database. Sections B through J of the solicitation will become the basis for the contract. Any blanks in Sections A through J will be completed by the Contracting Officer prior to award.<br /><br />Any questions regarding this RFP must be submitted in writing via e-mail to <a href="mailto:eatap@usaid.gov"><span style="color: #1155cc;">eatap@usaid.gov</span></a><span style="color: #00008e;">. </span>Questions must be submitted to <a href="mailto:eatap@usaid.gov"><span style="color: #1155cc;">eatap@usaid.gov</span></a> by the date indicated above.

(e) Non-responsiveness. Failure to provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause may cause Indian Affairs to find an offer non-responsive and to reject it. 

(f) Eligibility. 
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: 
(i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and 
(ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through

requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>

<p>(11)&nbsp; A. Objective:&nbsp; To find sources that are qualified to meet the requirements. Note that the specific requirements are subject to change prior to the release of any solicitation.<br /><br />B. Requirements:&nbsp; The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Adelphi Division on behalf of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this Market Research is to identify concerns that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to provide Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This Sources Sought is issued to communicate the ARL's program requirement to industry. ARL intends to use information gathered from these responses to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support formulation of an acquisition strategy. Early industry involvement in creating a properly scaled enterprise solution is critical to the success of this contemplated acquisition. <br /><br />C. Specifications: This effort is for the Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This work includes research and technical services supporting mission areas defined in Technology Program Agreements with Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) centers in information assurance (IA) and computer network operations. ARL collaborates with partners in other CSSPs, the law enforcement and counter intelligence communities in the areas of technology development and computer security research. The focus across the effort is defense against the sophisticated cyber adversaries to ARL, the Army, DoD, and the United States (US) Government. This effort strives to improve the state of the art in cyber defense. Cyber defense R&amp;D is reliant on raw data from real-world networks that contain vital evidence of the threats being perpetrated by hostiles against the network. Analysis of the data and the ability to improve attack detection accuracy and timeliness is intrinsically coupled with the agile development of new tools and techniques to combat adversaries. This ARL cyber defense effort partners with many organizations; some of which use the ARL CSSP services to provide primary or supplementary network defense services. Some are research partners using ARL-developed cyber defense tools and test-beds, and others are intelligence and law enforcement organizations that leverage ARL technology and share vital information about current threats. The extensive network view is a key enabler to the cyber research and technology enhancement mission. This effort's initiative is particularly focused on improving capabilities to combat sophisticated cyber adversaries as well as investigating the next generation of Defensive Cyber Operational Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), tactical network security, exploring prospective sensor capabilities, executing components of the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) strategy, risk measurement and monitoring, improving adversary attribution, and insider threat analysis. The ARL cyber mission uniquely derives its strength from the close synergistic bond between research and the technical services answering operational necessities. These activities demand skilled, forward-thinking staff at every position.<br />The objective of this effort is research and develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic cyber domain while providing 24x7 Cyber Defense Operations and Services within the environment of the Department of Defense<br /><br />D. Industry Day: Additionally, this Sources Sought is to inform interested parties of an upcoming Industry Day being hosted at Building 205 2800 Powder Mill Rd, 20783-1197 tentatively scheduled for 13 December 2016 at 9:00AM. <br /><br />All parties interested in the Industry Day shall notify this office by email NO LATER THAN 3:00 pm EST on 01 December 2016. This is a firm response date and Industry Day RSVPs and response information will not be accepted after 3:00 pm EST on 01 December 2016. If you are unable to attend the Industry Day, but still interested in submitting capabilities briefing documents, you must do so by the close of the Synopsis period (by 01 December 2016). Submissions should be emailed to Jessica.r.camunez.civ@mail.mil<br /><br />The Industry day will allow for one-on-one meetings with the first ten (10) responding prospective offerors. Each one-on-one meeting will be limited to thirty (30) minutes. The intent of the one-on-one meetings is the opportunity to discuss technical capabilities. It is recommended that at least one (1) technical representatives from prospective offerors attend.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Synopsis - J&amp;A for Other than Full and Open Competition &amp; Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE</strong> - Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) Research and Supporting Elements</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with<strong> ICF Incorporated, LLC. 9300 Lee HWY Fairfax, VA 22031-6050</strong> for research and development (R&amp;D) and technical services to support Cyber Security Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment.</p>
<p>The United States Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of <strong>FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies of Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements </strong>based upon the Government&sup1;s expertise, historical knowledge and understanding of the mission space, it is estimated that it would take approximately 18 months or longer to transition a new, unfamiliar contractor with Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) experiences and basic skills to meet Government-based applications in CSSP analysts and operational skills utilizing Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) developed analytics and technology. Breaking the transition timeline down, when considering the distributed and geographically dispersed nature of the infrastructure it will take two to three (2-3) months to merely transition control of the infrastructure. It will take another nine to twelve (9-12) months for the new staff to achieve journeyman proficiency with the infrastructure, and upwards of another year to achieve true expertise. Finally any major turnover in personnel (a real risk given the loyalty ICF staff have for their company), will require substantial time to identify, hire, and train replacements. Based on timeframes associated with normal personnel turnover, this will add an additional nine (9) months to the transition. In the very near term, the shortfall in the initial period of performance would deleteriously impact ARL's ability to sustain a high level of cyber defensive services and critically jeopardize our covered Federal Government and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. Without direct and uninterrupted contractor support in this arena, the real time cyberattacks would be accomplished without identification, notifications, response and recovery. Systems would be allowed to exist at a lower security posture without notice, increasing the realistic opportunities to compromise them without interception. Looking further out, this delay in capabilities would have a ripple affect across the entire DoD. There are multiple initiatives and development projects, such as the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) analytics, that ARL is specifically performing for the Department, which would not be able to be accomplished if not for the ongoing work. This transition of the ISCM is currently on-going and is slated to take between eighteen months to two (2) years. Once the transition is complete, those frameworks will be DoD-standard and thus readily available to others for future competition for this action. Delaying these types of abilities for up to two (2) years will do nothing but set the entire department back and ensure that the Department is not ready to meet the adversary of the future in cyber space falling short of the mission.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, this notice functions as a Request for Information (RFI) for offeror's who believe they can meet the Government's requirement. Any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, only if received by the closing date and time of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to use Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Responses to this notice are due on or before 17:00 EST, 01 February 2017 by email at Jessica.r.camunez.civ@mail.mil</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is conducting market research on the availability of dyed or colored Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers. The U.S. Army is specifically interested in materials that are dyed to military relevant colors, particularly Tan 499 or Coyote 498. Dyed UHMWPE fibers are of interest for their increased strength and durability for utilization in the Operational Clothing and Individual equipment. Importantly, dyed PE fibers must retain a significant portion of their strength properties after dyeing or coloring to be of interest.</p>
<p>The government is interested in receiving:</p>
<p>1. Samples of dyed or colored UHMWPE fiber (of any denier), that match Tan 499 or Coyote 498<br />2. Samples of dyed or colored UHMWPE textile swatches ( of any denier) that match Tan 499 or Coyote 498<br />3. Any information on the current and emerging industrial methods for UHMWPE fiber coloring<br />For companies interested in submission, the Government can provide color swatches and hue parameters for color matching purposes. Please see contact information below to request color information.</p>

This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This is a market survey for planning purposes. If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents.

The information received under this announcement may be used for developing acquisition strategy and refining operational requirements. Capability Statements, including attachments, are limited to ten (10) pages. Responses should be submitted in MS WORD and/or MS Excel or PDF, including attachments. Interested sources shall include information regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities.

<CONTACT>Ben Benvenutti, Email Benjamin.S.Benvenutti@NASA.Gov - Rosa L.  Fletcher, Contracting Officer, Email rosa.l.fletcher@nasa.gov
<DESC><div>NASA is providing notice of an opportunity to participate in the Civilian Commercialization Readiness Pilot Program (CCRPP) for NASA&rsquo;s FY 17 award cycle of its SBIR/STTR program. &nbsp;The purpose for this notice is to provide interested contractors with time to locate investors for applications.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The CCRPP was created as part of the SBIR and STTR Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P. L. 112-81, Section 5001) with the purpose of accelerating the transition of SBIR and STTR funded technologies to commercialization. &nbsp;The CCRPP accomplishes this acceleration through a combination of additional SBIR/STTR program investment and NASA or non-NASA entity sponsor investment.</div>
<div>NASA&rsquo;s CCRPP is available to small business concerns that:<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Have a completed SBIR/STTR Phase II award (from any federal Agency) selected from solicitations issued from fiscal year 2010 through 2014. &nbsp;However, NASA will not require completed performance of NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II awards from the 2014 solicitation, and NASA will not require completed performance of Phase II E or Phase II X options associated with a NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II award;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Have not yet received a CCRPP award (or its equivalent) or a sequential Phase II award from any federal Agency for the Phase II technology associated with the Phase II award in item 1;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Have secured an investor(s) willing to contribute matching funding to the maturation of the technology detailed in the application of research related to NASA interests. Investor(s) must be external to the NASA SBIR/STTR Program, which may include such entities as another company, a venture capital firm, an individual investor, a non-SBIR/non-STTR government program, or any combination of the above. An external investor cannot include the owners of the small business, their family members, and/or "affiliates" of the small business, as defined in Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Section 121.103.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>To be eligible, applicants must demonstrate maturation of the Phase II technology that aligns with NASA interests. The technology proposed for advancement toward commercialization should have a strong relevance to NASA&rsquo;s missions as well as a strong potential use by NASA and/or markets outside of NASA beyond the CCRPP investment.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>Eligible small business firms may submit a CCRPP application for the 2017 award cycle in response to this notice. &nbsp; NASA will match the investments with SBIR/STTR program funds between $100,000 and $2 Million for each CCRPP award. &nbsp;Eligible firms must identify and obtain commitment from an investor to provide matching funds prior to submission of the CCRPP application. &nbsp;Applications must be submitted via the NASA SBIR/STTR Proposal Submission Electronic Handbook (EHB).<br /><br />The CCRPP application requirements and associated investor guidelines will be available February 1st, 2017 at the NASA SBIR/STTR website: http://sbir.nasa.gov/content/post-phase-ii-initiatives#CRP. The EHB will accept CCRPP applications between March 1st, and March 31st, 2017 at <a href="https://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/submissions/public/login">https://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/submissions/public/login</a>. &nbsp;NASA will select those applications which are most meritorious and within the budget parameters stated above. <br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additional information is available at the NASA SBIR/STTR website: &nbsp;</div>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Overview</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) requests information regarding: Industry's </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">interest, technical capability, and qualifications, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor, to meet the Government's need to procure</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">towed electro-acoustic torpedo decoy systems. <br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />There is anticipated to be a full and open competitive procurement spanning FY2018 through FY2022 for twelve (12) months of development and first-article testing effort with four follow-on option years for production, and with potential deliveries extending out to FY2024. Manufacturing capabilities must support two (2) to five (5) systems per year for new construction ships, and additional systems to retrofit into the fleet (ideally installed as an engineering change kit and not a complete reinstallation effort).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon award, Classified (up to Secret) facilities for handling and storing hardware, documentation, and test software may be required. Upon request, the Government can provide environmental and acoustic test facilities for initial environmental qualification testing and subsequent testing as required.<br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The current US Navy capability, known as the AN/SLQ-25 system (commonly referred to as Nixie), is a towed electro-acoustic decoy system with built-in redundancy that consists of: towed bodies, tow cables, an over-boarding system, electronics cabinet (with an integrated operator display), and remote operator display. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The current capability is a standalone system that has been fielded on over 150 United States Navy ships and a similar number of foreign navy vessels.<br /><br /><br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The AN/SLQ-25 system employs an acoustic projector housed in each of two towed bodies which are attached to a dual drum winch via a tow cable. The tow cable and towed body are deployed and retrieved using an over-boarding system consisting of the dual drum winch, fleet angle compensators, deck sheaves and fairleads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A shipboard electronics cabinet provides signal processing capabilities and operator displays provide the man-machine interface for operational and maintenance functionality. The electronics cabinet hardware architecture has significant obsolescence issues; that cabinet and the towed body are strong candidates for redesign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other components have more stable architectures and may be built in the current configuration.<br /><br /><br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The system, in particular the over-boarding system, has well established ship's interfaces for power, space and weight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it is required that any new design stays within these constraints to minimize impacts to cost and schedule for new ship design and construction, as well as to allow for a more affordable approach to replacing in-service systems as part of the overall obsolescence resolution approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proposed designs for either the electronics or the over-boarding system would be subject to the appropriate environmental qualification testing to ensure shipboard requirements are met.<br /></span></p>

 BACKGROUND
The mission of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to efficiently and effectively provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States. In meeting these goals, the Veterans Health Administration, Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) ensures compliance with Public Laws, such as PL 101-576, that mandate the use of an activity-based cost accounting system. 
MCAO s Decision Support System (DSS) imports s and processes VA financial and clinical workload information to generate Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) information for the VA s Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and OI&T, as well as, the Department of Defense (DOD) in support of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center.  DSS information supports the mission of critical VA program offices, including VHA Allocation Resource Center and Office of Patient Care Services, to make funding and resource allocations and facilitates other critical managerial decisions.  
DSS is the VA s only system that provides patient encounter level activity-based costing.  As such, VHA workload data is available at product and patient encounter levels.  
This Healthcare Performance Benchmark project is to enable, and facilitate VHA Managerial Cost Accounting Office MCAO staff to create analogous and appropriate comparisons of VHA healthcare services with private-sector healthcare providers located in the United States.  Work will be conducted primarily by the MCAO staff, with a not-to-exceed twelve (12) individuals.  That MCAO staff will be comprised of highly experienced healthcare performance/cost data analysts and clinicians.  Contactor shall provide:
Access to Robust Private-Sector Healthcare Performance Database of inpatient and outpatient encounters that is historically linear containing at least three (3) of the most recent years.

<DESC>Under Statutory Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Spancrete, INC. for the maintenance of the Spancrete built parking structures under warranty located at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI. This announcement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1. The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied for services available from one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by January 30, 2017 by 10:00 AM CST. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. All interest received on or before January 30, 2017 will be evaluated by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.
