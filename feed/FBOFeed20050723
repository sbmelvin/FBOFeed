<DESC>East Vallecito Fuels Reduction Project approximately 160 acres. This is a cooperative project between the USFS and the BOR.  The primary objective of the treatment is to restore the forest to a structure and composition similar to the pre-settlement range of variation and in so doing, reduce the risk of stand-replacement fire or other disturbance.

Within areas of predominant ponderosa pine the proposed treatment is a thinning to reduce basal area to a range of 80 to 100 square feet per acre favoring the larger and healthier trees and clumps.  Existing openings and clumpiness will be enhanced by the thinning. 

The proposal for the mixed conifer is a restoration treatment removing a majority of the white fir and some of the Douglas-fir and pine.  All white fir, Douglas-fir and small pine ladder fuels will be removed from around any pre-settlement pine or Douglas-fir.  Hazard and potential hazard trees could also be removed in the treatment. The residual basal area will be from 120 to 80 square feet per acre with emphasis on fire resistant species such as pine and larger Douglas-fir.  Some mature aspen with or without evidence of decay will also be removed in order to remove hazard trees and stimulate sprouting.  The areas along the creeks will be protected with a variable and staggered buffer strip of 25 to 50 feet.  Some small Douglas-fir and white fir will be left in the campgrounds to serve as screens between the campsites.

The merchantable trees to be removed will be individually marked.  Non-merchantable small trees, limbs and tops will be chipped on site and the chips spread on the ground to serve as mulch and sediment filter.  Small white fir killed by the Missionary Ridge Fire would also be chipped.

No pre-Eurosettlement trees will be removed unless they are considered to be a hazard to campgrounds or the road. SEE NUMBERED NOTE 1.

The Contractor shall conduct Phase II of the study: GPS Modernization: A Strategic Cost-Benefit Analysis of L2C Deployment and Reflecting L5 deployment.  This contract is for Phase II which completes the analysis. 

NOAA has a requirement, as identified in decisions of the Interagency GPS Executive Board and NOAA Program Guidance memoranda to immediately complete this program. Timely completion of the study is essential to inform decisions about the timing and pace of deployment of the L2C signal which is expected to be available on the first Block IIR-M satellite to be launched this Fall. The effort will be completed under the Office of the Chief Economist which oversaw Phase I. 

The Phase II effort will incorporate scenarios for deployment of satellites and signals and for the strength and timing of demand for high precision GPS, dual frequency GPS and L2C and applications as a function of technical characteristics and capabilities of L1, L2, L2C, L5, and Galileo, developments in technology; substitution effects against dual frequency coded L1 C/A & L2C use vs. L1/L2 codeless/semi-codeless use and for L2C use vs. L1 C/A single frequency use; market segment characteristics, and market penetration paths; assessment of competition and reinforcement between L2C and public and private augmentations; application of improved methods of benefit valuation; scenario-based analysis of  benefits, costs and risks; issues raised by L2C for military decisions; roles of GPS in a global system of positioning, navigation and timing systems; and strategic quantitative and qualitative analysis of policy alternatives as a function of scenarios that integrate critical considerations. 

Unique Qualifications:

The proposed contractor has unique qualifications to perform the range of tasks involved in this contract.  A Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University, he has over 30 years experience as a consultant and employee in private industry, non-partisan think tanks, and government.

His government clients include the CIA, NSA, Department of State, SBA, HHS, and the Department of Commerce, with advice on strategic planning, financial analysis, business model development, U.S. and international economic development, science and engineering human resources and long-range trend analysis.
