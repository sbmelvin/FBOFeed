The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.   
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

The Initial task order was included in the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Pre-Solicitation announcement R12PS80172 that was posted on May 16, 2012.  This information is included below:

The dates included in this announcement are approximate and may be subject to change at the discretion of the Bureau of Reclamation.  Actual dates will be established at the time the Request for Proposal is made available.
The Department has approximately 70,000 employees and is comprised of nine (9) Bureaus (http://oneinterior.doi.net/oneinterior/Bureaus/index.cfm) with operations located across the United States and the U.S. Territories.
The Department is looking to replace its current drawing management systems under a single award Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract arrangement.  The objective is to obtain commercial-off-the-shelf software, software licenses, software maintenance, and support services such as configuration, implementation, and training support related to Drawing Management on a Task Order (TO) basis.
The IDIQ solicitation R12PS80172 and the initial task order solicitation R12PS80234 will be issued simultaneously and all potential contracts must submit the requirements for both solicitations in order to be considered for award of the resulting IDIQ and the initial task order.
This procurement was previously announced under Sources Sought Announcement R12SS80046, IInterior's Drawing Management Solution and Sources Sought Announcement R12SS80097, Department Drawings Management System as a request for information and comments to the Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  Comments from the Sources Sought Announcements were incorporated as applicable.

Minimally, the solution shall support the Department of the Interior's diverse workforce to include all bureaus and offices strategically located within the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories.  The solution shall be able to support either a Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) moderate internal system or FISMA moderate external certified software as a service (SaaS) environment.
Evaluation criteria for award consideration, listed in descending order of importance, may include technical/management approach, past performance on similar or comparable projects, and price.  Technical/management approach and past performance when combined are approximately equal to price.  The IDIQ contract will be awarded with a one (1) year base plus four (4) one (1) year option periods that will allow for both fixed price and labor hour task orders to be issued against the IDIQ.  In is anticipated that the initial task order will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period.  The resulting awards from the two solicitations will be based on the procedures prescribed by FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.
The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available for viewing at www.FBO.gov on or about June 4, 2012.  Proposals are tentatively due before close of business (COB) July 5, 2012.  The estimated contract ceiling for the IDIQ contract is $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.  The estimated task order amount is $1,300,000 to $2,300,000.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210, Software Publishers.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is $25 million.

Develop and conduct an experiment to determine tolerance ranges for thermal<br />protection, dexterity, grip, donning/doffing, size accommodation, and daunting<br />ensemble of requirements. Gloves that fit too tight may suppress thermal<br />protection and gloves that fit too loosely are impossible for fine dexterity tasks.<br />3.

Produce a set of prototypes of the newly developed gloves and conduct a<br />validation test along with at least one gloves manufacturer for improved<br />performance, safety, and accommodation capacity of the new design.<br />5. Complete a report documenting the above process and outcomes using the<br />format of typical peer-reviewed journals in the areas of human factors and<br />ergonomics, which would contain instruction, objectives, methods, results,<br />discussion, and conclusion.<br />6. Provide NIOSH a set of old design and a set of newly developed prototypes of<br />structural gloves to demonstrate the successfulness of this research to practice<br />case.<br />7. The task should be completed within 12 months from the effective date of the<br />contract.</p>

<DESC>SYNPOSIS<br />RFP-CMS-2012-0022
<p>Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) Contractor to support Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs)</p>
<p>The Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to maintain the Common Electronic Data Interchange (CEDI) front-end application for all four Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) claims processing contractors.</p>
<p>Currently, the CEDI front-end system provides a single front-end solution for the submission and retrieval of electronic transactions. Trading Partners submit X12 Version 5010 837 claims and 276 Claim Status Inquiry transactions and NCPDP Version D.0 transactions to CEDI.  CEDI performs all front-end edits on these transactions, assigns the Claim Control Number (CCN) to claims accepted by CEDI, and creates the flat files for delivery to the appropriate DME MAC.  X12 837 claims accepted by CEDI are delivered to the appropriate DME MAC based on the beneficiary state code and 276 files are delivered based on the contractor code in the header record of the file.  CEDI returns all electronic front-end reports as well as the X12 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA), 277 Claims Status Response, X12 999 Implementation Acknowledgment For Health Care Insurance (for X12 version 5010A1 837 and version 5010 276 transactions), TA1 Interchange Acknowledgement (for X12 version 5010A1 837 and version 5010 276 transactions if requested), and X12 277 Claim Acknowledgement (for X12 version 5010A1 837 transactions) to the Trading Partner's CEDI mailbox</p>
<p>CEDI performs NCPDP front-end edits, assigns the CCN to accepted claims, creates flat files for delivery to the appropriate DME MAC based on the beneficiary state code, and returns the NCPDP Transmission Response Transaction for NCPDP version D.0 claims.</p>
<p>The CEDI DME MAC front-end system shall not be integrated with any other commercial application or processing environment. The primary functions of the CEDI DME MAC front-end system generally will include: <br /> <br />&bull;	Hosting the CMSnet MLPS (Multi Level Protocol System) connectivity to receive claims and claims related electronic transactions claims 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except during planned downtime for system maintenance<br />&bull;	An electronic mailbox system for suppliers to retreive claims 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except during planned downtime for system maintenance, as well as offer customer support; <br />&bull;	EDI translation and front end editing activities for all ANSI ASC X12  and NCPDP versions as adopted by Federal regulation promulgated by DHHS and/or CMS, using Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software;<br />&bull;	EDI translation and front end activities for the following adopted formats:<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010A1 837 claims<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010A1 835 electronic remittance advice<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010 276 claim status request<br />&bull;	X12 version 5010 277 claim status response<br />&bull;	NCPDP version 5.1 claims<br />&bull;	NCPDP version D.0 claims<br />&bull;	X12 and NCPDP transaction routing;<br />&bull;	Connectivity support for EDI users;<br />&bull;	Trading Partners/Providers/Suppliers EDI enrollment; <br />&bull;	Free Billing Software (FBS) distribution and support; <br />&bull;	Submitter profile changes and updates;<br />&bull;	Transaction testing; <br />&bull;	EDI helpdesk support; <br />&bull;	Education and Outreach material for external users (e.g. DME MAC and Trading Partners/Providers/Suppliers).</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this requirement an offeror must:</p>
<p>&bull;	Be able to demonstrate their experience with the VMS shared system claims processing environment.</p>
<p>&bull;	Currently process DME claims for adjudication and payment in an active production EDI environment.</p>
<p>There are no exceptions to the requirements listed under the first two bullet points; offerors who do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration.</p>
<p>&bull;	Possess, at the minimum, Capability Maturity Model&reg; Integration (CMMI) Level II accreditation at contract award.  The offeror must be able to achieve CMMI Level III accreditation before contract option year 2.</p>
<p>&bull;	Be able to determine the best approach for transitioning the single front-end application for DME processing (approximately 77,302,091 annual claims) from the current CEDI system.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a MKIII 13 Dome Helmet Assembly. NASA/JSC intends to purchase this item from Air-Lock INC. The deliverables/products require expert suit hardware experience in the preparation, maintenance, and operations of the MK-III prototype space suit hardware components. Air-Lock is the only company with the MK-III dome helmet assembly design that can be built quickly and effectively to meet the Governments testing needs.  Additionally, Air-Lock, Inc. personnel have experience with the space suit systems used for suit testing at JSC and are familiar with NASAs human-subject test procedures with regards to proper documentation and review of the test protocol, hardware certifications, operations certifications, and hazards analysis to assure the overall safety of the test including the facilities, space suits, and the test subjects involved.  This is particularly true of the MK-III prototype space suit system with which the requested parts will be integrated.  Air-Lock, Inc. was the primary fabricator of the one of a kind MK-III and its components.  They possess a unique tooling and fabrication setup to produce these components. NASA does not own the data and design rights to the MK-III and its components and thus cannot fabricate the parts in-house nor provide the specifications to another vendor.  Air-Lock, Inc. is the only vendor with the data and design rights to the MK-III hardware components. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to LaToy Jones at latoy.j.jones@nasa.gov not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 27, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA at Kennedy Space Center has a requirement for additional environmental projects under the existing Medical and Environmental Service Contract (MESC) NNK08OQ01C. NASA intends to purchase the services from InoMedic Health Applications, Inc (IHA) on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The MESC is a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract that has a performance period of October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2017, inclusive of options. In addition to its baseline requirement, the contract has an ID/IQ component that is approaching its awarded maximum ordering value. The Government intends to increase the maximum ordering value of the ID/IQ component through the remainder of the contract performance period.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 28, 2012.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.
<p>Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source bases with Sarawak Hospice Society, Jalan Hospital, Kuching 93586, Sarawak, Malaysia.</p>
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard in $14.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from contract award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that associations with breast cancer risk factors vary by tumor pathology. Asian women seem to have a distinctive profile of breast cancer that differs from that seen in Western populations, such as earlier age at onset, more advanced stage, and higher frequency of ER-negative tumors. Large, population-based epidemiologic studies of characterizing molecular subtypes of breast cancer in Asian women are limited. Given that Asian breast cancer is associated with early age-onset and aggressive tumors, it is speculated that the prevalence of TN/basal tumors in Asian women may be higher than Caucasians.</p>
<p>Recently, Sarawak Hospice Society compared the distribution of breast cancer subtypes in the three ethnic groups (Chinese, Natives, and Malays) in Sarawak, Malaysia and found that Malays and Natives were more likely to develop TN tumors compared to Chinese despite of the overall lower incidence rates. These findings suggest that breast cancer subtypes may vary by ethnicity in Asian populations and it is likely that both genetic and environmental exposures may jointly contribute to the association between a specific subtype and a particular ethnic group. Tumor stratification in afore mentioned studies was all based on three markers only, ER, PR, and HER2, without separation of basal from TN tumors. A more refined molecular classification approach is needed to achieve finer and more accurate tumor stratification and to identify etiologic factors underlying a specific tumor subtype, which will be helpful in developing risk models for specific types of breast cancer and therefore improving targeted screening and prevention in the future.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to classify breast tumors into molecular subtypes and to identify distinct risk factors for each subtype in Malaysian women diagnosed at Sarawak General Hospital (SGH). The specific aim for this procurement is to recruit breast cancer patients to participate in the pilot study and retrieve clinical and medical data and biospecimens that are collected and stored by SGH.</p>
<p>Sarawak Hospice Society is uniquely qualified to perform this work for the following reasons: 1) the goal of this study is to identify breast cancer subtypes in a unique Asian population with different ethnicity groups. Residents in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia, come from three main ethnic groups: Natives (50%), Malays (25%), and Chinese (25%). The three races have maintained their distinct cultures, reproductive practices and diets, with very few intermarriages. Previous work by Sarawak Hospice Society's group showed that the distribution of breast cancer subtypes varied across these ethnicity groups, providing a unique resource to address NCI's research questions; 2) Sarawak Hospice Society is affiliated with Sarawak General Hospital (SGH). SGH is the only cancer centre in Sarawak and treats 93% of the breast cancer patients in Sarawak (Devi CR, Int J Cancer, 2012). Breast cancer patients will be recruited from that hospital; no commercial company would have access to these patients; and 3) the current study is an extension and expansion of previous work that was done by Sarawak Hospice Society, by increasing the number of breast cancer cases and conducting a detailed molecular profiling analysis. NCI will take advantage of the established infrastructure instead of initiating a completely new study.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on June 27, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120031-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>Pending Congressional Approval, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Tomahawk Block IV Full Rate Production (FRP) 9-13.  The anticipated contract will be a five (5) year multi-year contract, subject to obtaining multi-year authority.  If the multi-year is not approved, the Navy intends to award a contract with one base year and 4 option years.  Contract award is planned for the second quarter fiscal year 2012.  This requirement includes the hardware manufacture of Canistered Surface Ship Capable, Encapsulated Submarine Torpedo-Tube Launched, and Encapsulated Submarine Vertical Launch Tomahawk Block IV All-Up-Round (AUR) missiles and related hardware/equipment and services.  In addition to other related items/services, this may include  manufacture of Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) Capsules, SSGN compatible CCLS Retrofit Kits, MK 10 canisters, Special Tooling, Special Test Equipment, Range Safety Systems (RSS), Flight Test Kits, spares, etc.; hardware manufacturing and testing; sustaining engineering; support (or performance) of Operational Test Launch (OTL) Flight Testing, Product Verification Testing (PVT), and Functional Ground Testing (FGT); Guidance Test Set (GTS) upgrades, support, maintenance, and repair; refurbishment or remanufacture of containers, canisters and capsules; Government Furnished Equipment maintenance, repair and upgrade; engineering test support; various elements of logistics support; cost reduction and affordability improvements; obsolescence management and resolution; and Tomahawk Block IV training courses.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missiles Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons Systems (TWS).  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile, and is the only source capable of meeting scheduled thresholds for Fleet load outs of the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to conduct taskings under this contract, RMS is the only known source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to modify an existing contract (N00019-08-C-0029) for continued performance to complete the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Flight Visualization Data Analysis (FVDA) software development efforts for Phase 1 (F/A-18C/D/E/F and EA-18G) and to provide continued support of the MFOQA Engineering Tool (MET). MFOQA is a knowledge management capability and a software-based process that will be hosted on existing Department of the Navy (DON) computers and servers. MFOQA will collect, merge, and analyze pre-recorded aircraft flight data and other available data, such as aircrew information, aircraft custody assignment and organizational hierarchies. It will make the results available to authorized personnel at the operational unit levels. Potential benefits are estimated to be significant improvements in Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management, and Safety. MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action..
<p>NAVAIR intends to award this effort sole source to BGI-LLC, 520 South Main Street, Akron, OH 44311. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the authority found in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />BGI-LLC, a small veteran owned business, was competitively awarded the initial contract. The FVDA software is in development and no complete Technical Data Package exists today to permit full and open competition for completion of Phase 1 development efforts. BGI-LLC is the only vendor that has the technical data and detailed knowledge of the MFOQA system to complete the FVDA software development within the required timeframe without significant duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements.</p>
<p>The period of performance extension will be 1 December 2012 through 31 May 2014. Numbered note 22 applies. This synopsis is not a Request for Proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent BAE Systems Applied Technologies, Inc. (BAE), 1601 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850 that will provide for support to the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division (Code 4.5.10) of NAWCAD in the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of shipboard C4I electronic communication systems; the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of like systems at shore sites associated with the deployment of fleet support to surface ships; and the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of mobile and airborne C4I electronic communication systems designed to interface with the C4I electronic architecture of surface ships. This acquisition will result in a ceiling increase to the current contract N00421-11-C-1058. The proposed increase in ceiling is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under exisiting BAE contract N00421-11-C-1058 while the follow-on action, estimated award April 2013, is being competed. Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-11-C-1058 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 27 June 2012, 1530 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Kym Parker, Code 2.5.1.2.4.5, Telephone (301) 737-7560, FAX (301) 995-0430 or via email: kimberly.l.parker@navy.mil.
<p><br />Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services without causing a break in work. BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competitition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<CONTACT>Antonio L. Leathers

<a href="mailto:Leathers.Antonio@epa.gov">Leathers.Antonio@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION ACTION: This notice amends the original posting on January 12, 2012.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has a requirement to provide support for Ambient Air Monitoring and Quality Assurance Support.  The U.S. EPA's ambient air monitoring and quality assurance program focuses on issues concerning implementation and operation of national, state/local, and tribal air monitoring networks.  In addition, the program addresses the quality of the measurement data of the criteria air pollutants [carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3) nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and various sizes of particulate matter (PM10, PM10-2.5, PM2.5)], chemical speciation of particulate matter, air toxic compounds, and ozone precursors required to be measured by the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program.  A principal objective of EPA?s mo nitoring and quality assurance role is to ensure that the quality of the data collected and reported by state/local/tribal agencies, federal agencies, and other parties, can be quantified and can be used to support programs such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the federal reference and equivalency program, and the nations air quality management programs.  Solid technical support is critical to the US EPA's ability to support air quality management policies and programs, as this support will directly impact federal, state, and local air quality monitoring activities.  This requirement shall provide support for the ambient air monitoring and quality assurance programs including, but not limited to, the associated federal regulations and policies, outreach activities, technical guidance, field activities, special studies, program and quality system development, statistical support, desktop publishing support, website design and operation and data retrieva ls.  The resultant contract shall provide the necessary labor, material, facilities, and expertise required for the performance of tasks specified in the Statement of Work (See Draft Statement of Work). Specific details of the requirement will be outlined in the Statement of Work. The EPA anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee, level of effort term (work assignment contract) with a 60 month performance period consisting of a 12 month base period and four 12 month option periods. The estimated level-of effort is approximately 10,000 base hours plus approximately 30,000 optional hours for the base period and each of the four option periods. It is anticipated that the request for proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about June 28, 2012 and proposals will be due 30 days after the RFP issue date. EPA has determined that this solicitation will be issued under full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 with  a size standard of $14.0 million or less. This requirement is a follow on to EPA Contract EPD08047 with Research Triangle Institute (RTI).  The solicitation and all other information related to this procurement will be posted at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/index.htm#solam.  All interested parties should check this site frequently for updates. The anticipated award date for this requirement is on or around September 20, 2012.   NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. Hard copies or diskettes will not be available. Telephone and fax requests will not be honored.

The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges. It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios. It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC). Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces.<br> <br>The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training. Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range. Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications. Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification. <br><br>Additional information on the EST itself is located on PEO STRI's website. <br>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  The Government would NOT be providing any GFE other than the EST and its simulated weapons.<br><br>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The Government is interested in receiving your insight on what is the best methodology for mobilizing the EST to maximize home station training at a reduced cost.  Responses should include the following information: a) your company name, address, POC, email addresses, phone and fax numbers, and company's web page (if applicable); b) identification of business size as it relates to NAICS code 332311, i.e. US large or small business (SB), service disabled veteran business, HUB Zone, 8(a) certified business, Woman Owned SB, etc; c) short history of your firm's experience in providing relevant similar products/services; d) every page of your response must include your company's name as well as page number, i.e. page # of 15. The suggested page count is no more than 15 pages.

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost/benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<SUBJECT>Warehouse Building Information
<SOLNBR>BLS-SSN-ConstructionData
<RESPDATE>062012
<CONTACT>Michael V. DeAngelis, Phone 2026916039, Email DeAngelis.Michael@bls.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information, for planning purposes, regarding: (1) the availability and capability of potential sources that can provide the required information described below and (2) the size classification of the available and potential sources relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The NAICS code for this planned acquisition is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. Your response to the information requested will assist the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Producer Price Index (PPI) program requires services and data to aid in updating the warehouse building models and sample. In addition, a methodology to update the costs included in the model must be developed. The methodology should adjust the costs for each component of the model to reflect actual price movement observed within the region.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The services and data covered by this synopsis include everything necessary to re-specify warehouse building models for the four census regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West). This specifically includes:</p>
<p>1. Delivery of a project list of all new warehouse buildings bid on or built in the United States between June 2009 and June 2012. This list should exclude additions, alterations, and renovations to existing structures.</p>
<p>2. Development of four warehouse building models. One for each major Census region.<br />*See attachment for Model Example</p>
<p><br />3. Development of a methodology to update the input costs of the four regional warehouse building models on a quarterly basis. The updates should reflect actual price movements of input costs within each region.</p>
<p>4. Delivery of cost updates for each of the four regional models due on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>5. Provide assistance to BLS on an &lsquo;as needed' basis to understand the make-up of the models, to evaluate model cost changes, and to evaluate any future updates to the models due to significant changes in &lsquo;typical' construction materials and/or practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />VI. Approach:</p>
<p>1. The BLS will use information supplied by the vendor on new warehouse building projects built or bid on in the United States from June 2009 to June 2012 to determine the material composition of the high level specifications (roof type, building frame material, exterior wall material, etc) for four regional warehouse building models.</p>
<p>2. The vendor will detail four regional new warehouse building models using specific projects selected by the BLS from the list of building projects supplied by the vendor and the vendor's expert knowledge of current new warehouse building construction practices such as achieving LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification. These models will include current material, installation, and cost information which will be used to gather data from BLS respondents.</p>
<p>3. After the initial model development, the vendor will independently survey all relevant sources of cost data for the model on a regular basis in order to update the model cost information on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>4. The BLS will combine overhead and profit mark-up data obtained from initiated survey respondents along with material and installation cost data provided by the vendor to estimate output price trends for new warehouse building construction activity.</p>
<p>5. The BLS may request assembly/component specification updates to the regional models if there is a substantive shift in &lsquo;typical' construction methods and/or materials while the models are in use. Cost information will be required from the vendor if assembly/component specification data change in order to perform quality adjustment.</p>
<p><br />*****<br />Response Information:</p>
<p>In Order for BLS to asses a firm's capability, firms must submit a response that provides enough detail to indicate that it can provide the services that meet the requirements above.<br /><br />Vendor submissions of simple marketing materials or brochures, incomplete responses that do not conform to the elements of this request for information, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by BLS.</p>
<p>With your response, please include:</p>
<p>a. DUNS number<br />b. Company Name<br />c. Company Address<br />d. Current GSA Schedules (if applicable) appropriate to this notice<br />e. Type of Company (i.e. large business, small business, small disadvantaged, women owned, HUBZone, and Service Disabled) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration<br />f. Company point of contact, phone and email address</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted in an electronic form via e-mail to the Contracting Officer at DeAngelis.Michael@bls.gov no later than June 20, 2012 at 12:00 pm. Reponses will not be accepted after the due date. Responses must not exceed twenty (20) pages. Faxed information will not be considered. BLS will not accept phone calls regarding this notice. BLS will not return any information submitted in response to this notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with your submittal. Information received will be used in BLS's market research effort and for procurement planning purposes. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by BLS. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not to contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.</p>

<p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an Executive Branch Federal Government agency that oversees U.S. broadcasting of news and information to audiences around the world. BBG includes the Voice of America (VOA) and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), as well as grantee entities Radio Free Asia (RFA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the Middle East Broadcasting Network (MBN).

<SUBJECT>Collapsing the GRLS
<SOLNBR>GRLS
<RESPDATE>072712
<CONTACT>Natalie T. Smith , Contract Specialist, Phone 3146760181, Email natalie.t.smith@nga.mil - Lynne M. Ware, Contracting Officer, Phone 314-676-0188, Fax 314-676-3010, Email lynne.m.ware@nga.mil
<DESC>RFI for Collapsing the GRLS<br /><br />This request is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. A contract may not be awarded as a result of this announcement. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) is exploiting new technologies and infrastructure for maintenance of existing foundation data, the concentration on foundation data readiness and the maintenance of future foundation to be supported by technology developments. NGA is pursuing technological ideas to satisfy this revolution in geospatial foundation data production and maintenance.
<p>NGA is soliciting information papers to collapse the Global, Regional, Local, and Specialized/Urban (GRLS) density bands into a single database that supports multi-scale product generation and visualization in an internet mapping environment. The information provided in response to this request for information is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a capabilities statement regarding the company's experience or ideas for the requirements described herein. NGA will use this information to determine the feasibility of pursuing this capability as a future contract requirement.</p>
<p>While a single database is the goal, feature data collection would still be based on a scale density (e.g. 1:50,000, 1:100,000, 1:250,000, etc.) but the features collected would contain an attribute or other means of flagging the information as being appropriate for a particular range of viewing scales or product generation. Minimum spacing requirements, lengths or areas from the current Topographic Data Store (TDS) Data Content Spec (DCS) extraction guidance would still apply to allow for a less expensive, less dense collection that still supports the concept.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the concept, if 1:50,000 collection was being performed over the area surrounding NGA Campus East (NCE) in Springfield, VA, Interstate 95 would be collected and contain an attribute or flagging mechanism that indicated this road should be displayed at all viewing scales or in simple terms it is a very important road. Conversely, Barta Road would contain an attribute or flagging mechanism to indicate it would only be displayed if viewed at 1:50,000 or larger scales. In no way should it be construed that this is similar to the scale attribute associated with FACC because by that methodology any vector information collected for a 1:50,000 density would receive a 1:50,000 value and that is not what NGA is trying to represent.</p>
<p>Additionally, to the maximum extent possible, NGA would like to see the attribute or flagging mechanism be populated in a manner which could be scripted based on at least the following criteria:<br />a. The entire feature class is such that it should only be displayed at a given scale range.<br />b. Within a feature class, the attribution associated with a feature is such that a scale range can be derived.<br />c. There is no need to limit the break points to four as they were in the GRLS construct. If more are needed to achieve the goal, then that is acceptable.</p>
<p>If the DCS does not contain the appropriate attribution necessary to achieve a fully automated population of this attribute or flagging mechanism, NGA requests proposed additional attribution required to achieve this or alternative semi-automated means of achieving the single database supporting multi-scale products and visualizations.</p>
<p>The information should describe how and why NGA would utilize your solution; not only responding to the ability to meet the criteria listed, but detailed capability to ensure it is a viable solution for NGA. Do not include marketing materials or website links. Information is to be submitted by 1:00 pm CST 27 July 2012. Capability packages must not exceed 10 pages, 12 point font and must be submitted electronically.</p>
<p>Additional information requested:<br />1) Company Name and address, point of contact name, phone number and e-mail address<br />2) Experience in supporting a project of a similar nature. Please describe the magnitude of projects you've completed. <br />2)3) Please provide your small business status IAW NAICS Code 541511.</p>
<p>Submit the above information via email to Lynne Ware, Contracting Officer, at Lynne.M.Ware@nga.mil; Telephone number is 314-676-0188. You may call to verify receipt of your information. Contracting Office Address: Attn: ACSM Mail Stop L-13; 3838 Vogel Road Arnold, Missouri 63010-6238.</p>

<DESC><br />Introduction
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 334516 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Intramural Research Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods, noninvasive physiological studies, and minimally invasive interventional procedures. This work has included some of the first demonstrations of functional brain imaging, discovery of magnetization transfer contrast in NMR experiments, development and validation of new MR imaging methods, use of NMR and optical spectroscopy to study in vivo physiology, invention of novel two photon optical microscopy methods, and study of some of the first uses of MRI to guide intravascular catheter-based procedures and robotic surgery. The NHLBI Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory, one of the intramural research laboratories within NHLBI, is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from subcellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions.</p>
<p>Computed Tomography (CT) is an x-ray based technology that produces noninvasive cross-sectional images of the body. The advent of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners enabled acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional images of the body when married with helical scan methods. The value of the resulting high resolution images has been recognized by many groups around the world as providing high enough resolution images to diagnose coronary artery stenosis in patients. This methodology is useful in a wide range of cardiovascular applications including noninvasive angiography, imaging heart valves and the pericardium. One disadvantage of current a generation MDCT scanner is the limited spatial coverage of the detectors. Typically, 64-detector scanners cover 4 or less cm along the axial direction of the body. To produce the highest quality images of the body, helical scanning modes are used which frequently use 80% overlap between each rotation to guarantee adequate spatial coverage and minimize image artifacts. This increases radiation exposure and reduces temporal efficiency.</p>
<p>Computed Tomography has been recognized as a large fraction of medical radiation exposure. The Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory has a strong clinical and research interest in developing and optimizing radiation reduction techniques.<br />Mandatory Specifications</p>
<p>1. The instrument must be a detector capable of acquiring 320 rows of data simultaneously at 0.5 mm detector width thickness for reconstruction into 3-dimensional CT images of the body whereby 15cm of the body can be imaged in one rotation around the body.<br />2. The range shall be large enough to cover many organs such as the brain and the heart within one rotation of the scanner.<br />3. Gantry rotation time is specified to be at least: 350ms indicating that cardiac images can be obtained within one rotation. The gantry bore diameter is specified to be at least 72 cm.<br />4. Helical scanning mode should support up to 160 simultaneous detector rows of acquisition. Due to the complexities of the CT datasets, image reconstruction speeds of 50 images per second are required.</p>
<p>MDCT Scanner Specifications</p>
<p>1. The system will include all hardware and software necessary to acquire and reconstruct images for a wide range of applications including but not limited to coronary calcium, contrast enhanced CT coronary angiography, angiography of other blood vessels, chest, brain, body, and other general CT applications. <br />2. The CT scanner shall be capable of cardiovascular imaging including single heartbeat scans, sub-mSv coronary CT angiography, iterative reconstruction image processing methods, and a fluoroscopy mode. <br />3. The basic MDCT system shall include all hardware needed to trigger acquisitions from an ECG. <br />4. The system should also include a scanner table which can be used to move the patient in and out of the scanner. <br />5. The contractor shall include an operator console, image reconstruction computers, and 3 post-processing/image review workstations.</p>
<p>Capability Statement</p>
<p>Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer. The capabilities statement should include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientists, medical experts, and technical personnel as it relates to the above outlined requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) an outline of previous research projects in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated, and 5) any other information considered relevant to this program.

<a href="mailto:david.c.boone@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Kansas City</a>
<DESC>This is a sources sought notice, a market survey whose purpose is to elicit information only. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. This is not a solicitation.<br><br>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of members of the Small Business Community to include Section 8(a) concerns, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB-Zone) concerns, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns to compete and perform a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Construction Contract. The procurement will result in the award of a firm-fixed price construction contract. <br><br>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, requires a construction contract to construct dike reinforcement in the Tadpole Island chute, Moniteau County, Missouri. The Tadpole Chute is located between Missouri River Miles 179.8 to River Mile 180.5. The chute was initially constructed in 2006. Floods have widened the chute and approximately doubled the flow through the chute since construction and threatened the navigability around the bend. Flows must be reduced to maintain navigability. In order to do this, the wooden pile dike structure at the chute entrance will be built up and reinforced with rock to reduce the flow through the chute.<br><br>Work will consist of placing new quarry-run stone within the chute at or around the current buried pile dike at Station 87+57. All work to be performed will be completed by floating plant as no land access will be available. Contractor must have capability of mobilizing, loading, and unloading barges from accessible approved quarries along the Missouri River. Rock is typically placed by way of dragline or track-hoe from a work barge. New stone must be broken, quarry-run, durable stone, approved and tested, and weigh no more than 2000 lbs. A specific description of structure work will be provided to place stone. <br><br>During construction in 2006, existing pile dikes were broken to -7 CRP or lower in an area 200 ft long by 15 feet wide to allow for the placement of notch rock. Most of the rock has since washed away and the pile dike has been worn down in areas, but the majority of the pile dike remains in place. <br><br>Adding rock to the pile dike structure is an attempt to constrict and decrease flows through the chute. Rock will be added to the existing pile dike to achieve a consistent elevation of -10 CRP in the center of the chute for a width of 15 feet and length of 150 feet. Rock will then be added at a 3:1 slope until an elevation of +6 CRP (566 feet) is achieved. 20,000 - 30,000 tons of rock will be added to the existing pile dike structure. The width of the chute is approximately 600 feet and the depth of water at the dike location is approximately 15 feet. <br><br>The magnitude of the construction is estimated to be between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The NAICS Code is 237990. The small business size standard is $33.5 million. <br><br>This sources sought notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is NOT guaranteed. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this notice with a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 22 June 2012 by 14:00 (CST). The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed twenty (20) pages. All attachments must be provided in either Microsoft Word (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format. At a minimum, the following must be provided:<br><br>1. Company name;<br>2. Company mailing address;<br>3. Point(s) of Contact including Telephone Number(s) & E-mail Address(es);<br>4. Company's current small business category (Small Business, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and/or 8(a)) as it relates to (NAICS) Code 237990;<br>5. A capabilities statement of your firm's capacity to meet this requirement to include any similar projects performed over the last two (2) years;<br>6. Company's aggregate and single project bonding capacity;<br>7. A listing of the company's equipment that will be used to execute this work (to include "floating plant" equipment).<br><br>If a solicitation is released in connection to this requirement, vendors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for an award. Firms can register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov. For further questions or concerns regarding CCR, please contact CCR assistance at (888) 277-2423, Monday through Friday from 08:00 to 18:00 (EST). Potential vendors must also complete their online representations and certifications (ORCA). To do so requires CCR registration, including an MPIN number. Instructions for completing the ORCA registration may be obtained, and required information may be entered at http://orca.bpn.gov. <br><br>Per the direction of FAR 4.5 "Electronic Commerce in Contracting", the Federal Government shall use electronic commerce whenever practicable or cost-effective. Therefore, responses to this announcement shall be sent via email to david.c.boone@usace.army.mil. Responses via FAX or traditional mail will not be accepted. For specific Small Business questions, contact Carol McIntyre at (503) 808-4602. <br><br>All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation. <br><br>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO INCUR COSTS IN ANTICIPATION OF AN AWARD. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT BOUND TO MAKE ANY AWARDS UNDER THIS NOTICE.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR A RQUEST FOR QUOTE.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT request only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. 

This notice is published for market research purposes only. This notice is open to qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  Information is sought regarding: (1) the availability and capability of all qualified SDVOSB sources; (2) size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services - size standard $7 Million dollars. 

Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. The Government is seeking potential sources for inspecting and cleaning water tanks in Fort Harrison, Montana as indicated below. 


DESCRIPTION:  This is a Sources Sought Notice for the following services under project number 436-11-SLP-104 - "Water Reservoir Inspection and Cleaning" at the Fort Harrison VA Medical Center in Fort Harrison, Montana.  Please indicate your interest in this project by providing a capability statement via email to Lori.Krohn@va.gov by June 19, 2012 at 2:00pm Mountain Time.  
To comply with Montana Department of Environmental Quality standards, it is necessary for the VA to inspect and clean its potable water storage reservoir.  Inspection of the vessel shall insure that the structural integrity of the vessel is consistent with its loading capacity of 500,000 gallons.  Cleaning of the potable water vessel is also required.  Lastly, the structural integrity of the 250,000 gallon irrigation reservoir is required.  Specific directions as to the manner in which these tasks are completed are defined in this document.  

Potable Water Reservoir Inspection

The existing 500,000 gallon potable water reservoir was constructed in the late 1980's and has not received a structural inspection since that time.  The tank is constructed in a tendon pre-stressed round concrete manner and has an approximate diameter of 60 feet and an approximate depth of 25 feet.  The reservoir is recessed into the ground, protruding approximately 3 feet on the uphill side and nearly 10 feet on the downhill side.  To meet compliance, a structural inspection complaint with AWWA D115-06 shall be performed.  This inspection shall be performed "wet" as the tank is a critical supply to the Medical Center.  To satisfy VA requirements, the contractor must provide a report confirming the structural integrity of the reservoir, or provide a list of required corrective actions and a corresponding cost estimate to the VA.  This report must be stamped by a registered Structural Engineer in the State of Montana.

 
Potable Water Reservoir Cleaning

The aforementioned potable water storage vessel has never been cleaned to remove accumulated solids from the vessel since initial construction.  In order to properly perform the inspection and to comply with the requirement to maintain service, the tank cannot be entirely drained, so the cleaning will have to occur in a filled reservoir, requiring the use of divers.  Cleaning of the tank shall occur in a manner that complies with AWWA-C652 and the Ten State Standards.  Cleaning must occur under negative pressure with expulsion of materials to the exterior of the vessel, essentially vacuuming solids from the vessel interior.  Documentation of cleaning shall be provided, demonstrating compliance to AWWA and the Ten State Standards.  This documentation shall be signed by a registered professional hydrologist recognized by the State of Montana.  Prior to divers entering the tank, a comprehensive safety plan specific to the activities and the reservoir in which they are being performed must be submitted and approved by the VA Engineer and the VA Safety Officer.

Irrigation Water Reservoir Inspection

The existing 250,000 gallon irrigation water reservoir served as the potable water reservoir before the construction of its replacement.  The tank is constructed of poured concrete, and is rectangular in shape with two independent holding compartments.  The reservoir is recessed into the ground, yet protrudes significantly.  As this reservoir does not serve as potable water, compliance is not mandated; however a structural inspection has not been performed in the past.  This tank can be emptied to allow for a "dry" inspection, and will not require cleaning.  The tank is to be inspected to ensure ability to safely hold the design capacity of 250,000 gallons of water to ensure the safe continued operation of the vessel for its intended purpose.  The contractor must provide a report confirming the structural integrity of the reservoir, or provide a list of required corrective actions and a corresponding cost estimate to the VA.  This report must be stamped by a registered Structural Engineer in the State of Montana.

An OSHA 30 competent person must be present at all times when contractors are working.  Contractors will follow all VA safety procedures, including the issuance of a temporary badge when on station.  The C&A requirements do not apply and the Security Accreditation Package is not required.   The VA will provide drawings of the reservoirs to the extent that they exist.  Drawings are on paper only, therefore the originals cannot leave the site, though the VA will enable copies to be made on site.  Access to the physical locations of the reservoirs must be coordinated with the VA as crossing of property not owned by the VA is required.  The intended duration of all activities described in this Scope of Work is 120 calendar days.   If the submitted report does not comply with the requirements stated directly and by reference in this Scope of Work, the submittal will be rejected without the addition of days to the contract.
Please indicate your interest in this project by providing a capability statement via email to Lori.Krohn@va.gov by June 19, 2012 at 2:00pm Mountain Time.

There is no other known source as Microsoft Premier Support is the creator and sole proprietor of said software. Access to proprietary Microsoft Intellectual Property (IP) which includes Microsoft's Operating System software code is required for all of the required MPS services and this access is only available to Microsoft employees. Microsoft (MPS) require access to proprietary Microsoft source codes, tools, processes, and knowledge to provide the MPS.

When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) full and open competition need not be provided for. The anticipated period of performance is 12 months with two (2) one year options. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications, in writing, within 4 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Submit response to the GSA, Attn: Karen P. Ziemba, 700 S. Palafox Street, STE 125, Pensacola FL 32502 or email to Karen.ziemba@gsa.gov . No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Incorporated, of Athens, Georgia, for the acquisition of Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a foodborne parasite that cannot be propagated in the laboratory (in vivo or in vitro). Thus, any work associated with this parasite entails acquiring fecal samples from naturally infected individuals.
<p>*****Sole source determination is based on the need for continued effort and collaboration between FDA laboratories and University of Georgia/ Dr. Ynes Ortega. Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts are difficult to obtain, and processing them from human stool requires a high degree of skill and experience. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a pathogen listed in a high priority Import Produce Assignment (DFPG# 12-02). In order to ensure that the method used to detect this parasite in produce is efficient and trustworthy, a supply of C. cayetanensis oocysts is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ynes Ortega with the University of Georgia Research Foundation is the only known source capable of providing the required services.</p>
<p>*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by June 25, 2012 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<p>I. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE DOCUMENT AS A "JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION"</p>
<p>See Page 1</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>We are requesting to purchase Eastman Kodak Film Stock for the preservation of the Motion Picture Collection. Purchasing this film stock will not only make it possible to preserve the records, but also to make them accessible for individual researchers and the public at large. Eastman Kodak is the only manufacturer of the particular internegative, duplicating positive, and panchromatic negative film required to work in conjunction with old originals and with other intermediate films in the normal process of film printing. The other two motion picture film manufactures in the world, Agfa and Fuji, do not manufacture comparable laboratory and print film stocks. Substituting other film stocks, even if they existed, would require extensive recalibration of established equipment and processes, would waste considerable time, and would lead to inferior end products.</p>
<p>III. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE)</p>
<p>The following film stock is needed:</p>
<p>Kodak 35mm color negative film stock, stock number 8002627 - 22 reels<br />Kodak 35mm 2383 color positive film stock, stock number 1246883 - 36 reels<br />Kodak 16mm 3383 color positive film stock, stock number 8889230 - 18 reels<br />Kodak 16mm 3272 color negative film stock, stock number 8392490 - 50 reels<br />(note: new catalog number for 8392490 is 8002743 for 16mm 3273 color negative film stock)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) -"Only One Responsible Source" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>V. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED.</p>
<p>This acquisition meets the authority of FAR 6.302-1 which states that this authority may be used "when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or,...from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." See above II.</p>
<p>VI. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak is the only manufacturer of the particular internegative, duplicating positive, and panchromatic negative film required to work in conjunction with old originals and with other intermediate films in the normal process of film printing. The other two motion picture film manufactures in the world, Agfa and Fuji, do not manufacture comparable laboratory and print film stocks.</p>
<p>Potential sources include a number of Kodak distributers.</p>
<p>VII. A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>Market research has been conducted to determine whether or not Afga and Fuji products meet NARA's requirements. They do not have the full range of products needed to capture the various types of print and negative types within the collection. Furthermore, the vendor that processes our color film (Colorlab) does not purchase the chemistry needed to develop Agfa and Fuji stocks, nor do they have any plans to begin purchasing this chemistry. If NARA were to purchase Agfa or Fuji stocks we would be required to recalibrate all of our equipment and create additional contracts with additional vendors to have these films developed.</p>
<p>VIII. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (SEE PART 10) AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>See paragraph VI. above.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. SEE FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>X. A LISTING OF THE SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION THAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER'S KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Oregon Salmon Commission. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract will accomplish the following tasks: <br />1.) Contract with up to 120 boats to conduct fishery sampling under the direction of Project Collaborative Research on Oregon Ocean Salmon (CROOS) and NMFS scientists, 2.) Provide fleet management, logistical support and coordination of sampling activities, 3.) Provide oceanographic data loggers and sampling equipment necessary to execute the study design and 4.) Provide chemicals and laboratory supplies to conduct genetic analysis on 2640 samples. The Oregon Salmon Commission has unique knowledge of the Oregon commercial fishery and unique access to participating boats. The Oregon Salmon Commission (OSC) is an industry-funded agency that operates under the umbrella of the Oregon Department of Agriculture's Commodity Commission Program. The primary function of OSC is to promote the industry and represent its members in marketing, management, education, and research. Since 2005 the Commission has been a central participant in Project CROOS (Collaborative Research on Oregon Ocean Salmon), an industry-academic-government initiative to advance the science of fishery management through application of genetic stock identification, information technologies, communication channels and the internet. The OSC plays a major role in Project CROOS as the mechanism through which the fishing fleet participates in Project CROOS activities. Project CROOS depends, fundamentally, on fishermen collecting data at sea during the regular course of commercial fishing and, at times, engaged in experimental sampling activities outside of the commercial fishing routine. The OSC provides communication with the fleet, manages contracts with up to 160 individual boats, tracks activities, issues paychecks, and is the owner of data that are collected (unless those data are collected under another authority, such as a NMFS Scientific Collecting Permit, for example). The Salmon Commission is dedicated to making Project CROOS data available for use in a wide variety of forums while protecting the legal rights and privileges of fishermen under the Magnusen-Stevens Sustainable Fisheries Act. The OSC maintains a network of "fleet liaisons" under the direction of a fleet manager. Liaisons are located in each port on the Oregon Coast, and are the primary contact for fishermen in each port. The fleet manager coordinates the activities of the liaisons. It is through this infrastructure of contracts and fleet management that Project CROOS coordinates sampling activities. The work requested requires the Contractor to interface with a distributed fleet of independent fishermen. These fishermen interact, on a regular basis, with the State of Oregon, the fish buyers and processing plants, and their marketing organization; the Oregon<br />Salmon Commission. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) of this procurement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $14.0M. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with period of performance commencing approximately Aug 1, 2012 through Sept 1, 2013. It is the Government's belief that only the Oregon Salmon Commission can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition. ****The Western Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services, located in La Jolla, CA on a sole source basis with Iowa State University, Department of Science and Technology. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for purchase of sequencing services, utilizing Illumina's high throughput sequencing technology, are required to conduct genomic and RNA sequencing of yellowtail (Seriola lalandi) samples. In addition to the sequencing services, bioinformatic support is also needed to create a draft assembly of the yellowtail genome and transcriptome, and to generate gene expression profiles. Illumina's sequencing technology will be used to create a draft assembly of the yellowtail genome and generate whole-transcriptome, quantitative digital gene expression profiles. This technology is a powerful tool that enables the discovery, profiling and quantification of RNA transcripts across the entire transcriptome (=the complete set of RNAs present in an organism at a particular time). The Illumina sequencing platform provides major advances over other types of large-scale gene expression analyses in terms of comparability, coverage, and sensitivity of expression levels. This is very important for exploring differences or changes in expression between groups where little is known or can be predicted regarding the underlying causes of variation between those groups. Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms were compared for use in this research project. Given the research needs and budget, Illumina's platforms provided the closest fit. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with delivery date of no later than Dec 10, 2012. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $14.0M. It is the Government's belief that only Iowa State University can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice.

<SUBJECT>76--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO WORKAMPER NEWS FOR ADVERTISING SERVICES
<SOLNBR>W912P5-12-Q-0004
<ARCHDATE>09112012
<CONTACT>Isaac J. Taylor, 615-736-5679

<a href="mailto:isaac.j.taylor@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Nashville</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Workamper News, Inc. of Heber Springs, Arkansas for advertising services to include a Featured Employer package, 150 EmployerPlus subscriptions,  waived revision charges for Featured Employer super pages, 75 word Help Wanted ads for all participating projects, two articles and magazine cover in Sept/Oct issue, six pages of Volunteer Opportunities and four pages of Park/Gate Attendant opportunities, one-half page display ad in each of the six issues each year with layout and design at no additional charge, access to online resumes, and two Hotline ads/year/EmployerPlus subscription up to 75 words. These services are for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Volunteer Clearinghouse, which services USACE nationwide, and is managed by the Nashville District.<br>This procurement has been approved for other than full and open competition under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  <br><br>Workamper News provides a multi-faceted package to the Corps to reach a specific target audience, those that want to work and camp. This is a highly specialized package that would be difficult to develop specifications, to evaluate proposals, and to keep government labor costs at a level that would be recoverable. Workamper News provides access to the target audience the Corps needs to reach to obtain volunteers and park attendants that want to work and camp at the campgrounds and recreation areas across the country. Volunteers perform many important duties in natural resources and recreation management. They serve as park and campground hosts, staff visitor centers, maintain trails and park facilities, conduct educational programs, assist with wildlife habitat and more. Most of the long-term volunteers are willing to perform these services in exchange for a free campsite at a Corps campground. The Independent Section valued an hour of volunteer service in 2011 at $21.79. The value received far exceeds the costs of the services from Workamper News.  The combination of items that Workamper News provides is unique with the Featured Employer package, subscriptions, ads with layout and design at no additional charge, articles, magazine cover, pages of Volunteer and Park/Gate Attendant opportunities, and access to online resumes. This combination of services from the target audience needed is not available elsewhere at a cost-effective price. The cost of government labor to attempt to procure it would be substantial in relation to the cost of the package. Government labor will include a technical representative (GS-12) spending time on the development of performance specifications, one contract specialist (GS-9) on contracting oversight and the development of a competitive solicitation, and costs from both and one other technical representative (GS-12) to evaluate proposals. It is expected that these efforts would not be required if these services and items were provided by Workamper News. It would be unlikely that the government would expect to recover these costs. Most significantly, Workamper News provides a unique package to the government that would be difficult to obtain elsewhere. There are no other apparent alternatives that would be effective at reaching the specific target audience of those that want to work and camp. Outdoor and camping publications would reach those that want to recreate and camp, and not necessarily those that want to work. Other publications do not offer the multi-faceted Featured Employer package, subscriptions,  waived revision charges, ads, articles and magazine cover, pages of Volunteer Opportunities and Park/Gate Attendant opportunities, one-half page display ads, and layout and design at no additional charge to reach the target audience that would provide the necessary benefits to the Corps of Engineers Volunteer Clearinghouse. <br>The Federal Acquisition Regulations allow for the submission of capability statements from prospective offerors to show interest which shall be considered by the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  This is not a request for capability statements or quotes.  However, the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider any capability statements or quotes submitted by all responsible sources.  Depending on the evaluation result of the capability statements, the Contracting Officer will determine if this sole source action is justified or if a solicitation must be issued to interested firms.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  If potential offerors choose to submit information, past performance and references regarding capability to perform these services must be provided along with the statement of capability.  The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email capability statements or quotes to Isaac.J.Taylor@usace.army.mil@usace.army.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  The closing date for submission of capability statements or quotes is June 28, 2012, 8:00 AM Central Daylight Time.  <br>

<p>FULL TEXT ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>1. REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to advance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge in Space and Missile technology. Proposals that either enable the development and transition of innovative high payoff space technologies supporting the warfighter to ensure America's advantage to meet performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability and affordability goals, or which enhance performance or significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies, are of particular interest.</p>
<p>B. This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) describing the research areas of interest for the Infrared Radiation Effects Laboratory program. A single award of a contract is anticipated with a period of performance of 60 months.</p>
<p>C. TECHNOLOGY AREA DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>This technical effort involves the following areas: (1) radiometric characterization of focal plane arrays (FPAs), detector arrays and individual detectors, (2) electronic characterization of multiplexer/readouts and individual circuits, and (3) radiation characterization of readout integrated circuits, test device structures, and space FPAs using gamma radiation, proton radiation, x-rays, electrons, and heavy ions.</p>
<p>Testing may utilize the Mosaic Array Test System (MATS), which will be furnished, if needed, by the Government. The MATS is designed to characterize devices at room and cryogenic temperatures in both clear and radiation environments. Contractor proposed systems may be utilized in addition or in place of the MATS, but it is important to note that any system used must have cryogenic characterization capability and it must have the ability to be transported to and operated in radiation facilities. Also, any system used for characterization must be amenable to various device types and configurations. Device characterizations will be carried out at various facilities to include the AFRL Building 426 facility, the AFRL Colbalt-60 source (both at Kirtland AFB, NM and provided as Government Furnished Equipment/Property), and at a remote proton source facility selected by the offeror. AFRL RVSS anticipates the need for characterizations of approximately 20-25 FPAs per year, including the characterization of 10-12 devices per year at the offeror's selected proton and heavy ion sources estimated at six days per characterization - these numbers are estimates and are subject to change.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct innovative development programs to identify operational procedures, test procedures, analytical techniques, and/or test hardware that will advance the state-of-the-art in test devices and the analytical and experimental capabilities of the laboratory. The end products from characterization will be test plans, test data, data briefings, technical reports, and in-depth data analysis. Work performed may be classified up to the TS/SCI level (see Draft DD Form 254, included in the Model Contract (Attachment 1)). Offerors must be capable of obtaining and maintaining an appropriate security clearance.</p>
<p>The contractor shall make recommendations to the Government on the scheduling for the implementation of these programs. Upon approval from the Government and the availability of funds, the contractor shall perform all necessary analysis, design, fabrication, integration, and evaluation of hardware and/or software necessary to accomplish characterization. Any improvements or changes to the Government Furnished Equipment/Property shall be appropriately documented, shown to be beneficial to the Air Force, and advance the state-of-the-art in FPA characterization.</p>
<p>A minimum of one member of the IRREL technical staff must possess and maintain a Cobalt-60 certified source operator's license as outlined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct a continuing safety program for the duration of the contract to assure that safety features are incorporated into the operation of the laboratory and the design and fabrication of the test equipment. The IRREL staff will be required to comply with KAFB Instruction 32-7001, dated 1 February 1996, for managing hazardous materials and the Phillips Research Site Operating Instruction 21-101, for tool control.</p>
<p>D. The following data deliverables are representative of the types of data that may be required: (a) Program Plan with updates as needed; (b) Monthly Status/Financial Reports; (c) Final Report, draft and final; (d) Presentation Materials, (e) Patent Reports; and (f) Unique Identification Designator (UID). Data deliverables are subject to negotiations.</p>
<p>2. ANTICIPATED FUNDING</p>
<p>Anticipated funding for the program (not per contract or award) is $9.9M, with the following anticipated budget: FY 12 $500K; FY 13: $1.7M; FY 14: $1.8M; FY 15: $2.0M; FY 16: $2.2M; FY17: $1.7M. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability.

The page limitation includes all information i.e., indices, photographs, foldouts (2 page), appendices, attachments, resumes, C-SOW, etc. Each printed side counts as one page. Blank pages, title pages, tables of content, lists, tabs or cover sheets are not included in the page count. The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.</p>
<p>3. Cost/Business Proposal</p>
<p>Separate this proposal into a cost section and a business section. Cost proposal must conform to requirements as stated in Cost Proposal Instructions, see Attachment 3.</p>
<p>a. Cost Section. The cost proposal containing other than cost or pricing data shall be submitted in the format provided in the announcement and is necessary for the Government to perform a cost realism analysis. Adequate price competition is not anticipated for this BAA. After receipt of proposals, however, a determination as to the existence of adequate price competition will be made by the cognizant Procuring Contracting Officer. If adequate price competition is determined not to exist, the Government reserves the right to obtain certified cost or pricing data from the offeror. Based on the type of instrument proposed, use the appropriate cost proposal instructions included as Attachment 3 to prepare the cost proposal. Submit the electronic copy of the cost proposal worksheets on a compact disk in a PC compatible file format in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 or later version. The file must contain all cell formulas, and the formulas must be viewable. Cost proposals have no page limitations.</p>
<p>b. Business Section. The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual arrangement, such as type of contract/instrument, any unique terms and conditions, any exceptions to terms and conditions of this announcement, and any information not technically related. Provide rationale for exceptions. As a goal, offerors are requested to keep the business section to 20 pages. This section should include the following items as appropriate.</p>
<p>(1) Completed representations and certifications and any specific representations and certifications identified in this BAA (see BAA-RV-12-03 - Attachment 2).</p>
<p>(2) Completed Proposal Content Checklist. Failure to provide a complete proposal may result in a determination that the proposal is non-responsive and may be eliminated from consideration for award.</p>
<p>(3) Subcontracting Plan, if applicable, as described in paragraph 9A below.</p>
<p>8. PROPOSAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. GENERAL.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select for award to responsible offerors/contractors any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement are not met by the proposal due date and time. At minimum, incomplete proposals may be given lower priority and, although technically acceptable, not awarded due to funding limitations. No further evaluation criteria than those listed in paragraph B will be used.</p>
<p>B. EVALUATION CRITERIA.</p>
<p>The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>- Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal <br />- Importance to AFRL/RV programs<br />- Fund availability/affordability</p>
<p>Price will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Price will be evaluated and may be negotiated if necessary on proposals selected for award.</p>
<p>C. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS</p>
<p>The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>1. CATEGORY I: Well conceived scientifically and technically sound proposals important to program goals and objectives. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance subject to funding constraints.</p>
<p>2. CATEGORY II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals that may require further development and may be recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I proposals and are not always funded.</p>
<p>3. CATEGORY III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs and may be recommended for rejection.</p>
<p>D. AWARD NOTICES</p>
<p>Offerors will be notified in writing whether or not their proposal is recommended for award. An award recommendation is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract, grant or assistance instrument is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p>E. DEBRIEFINGS</p>
<p>When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs.</p>
<p>9. OTHER INFORMATION</p>
<p>A. SUBCONTRACTING PLANS: Small Business Subcontracting Plans are required under FAR 19.702 for efforts anticipated to exceed $650,000. Prospective offerors shall submit applicable subcontracting plans in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704 along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement. If a company has a master subcontracting plan and individual goals, as described in FAR 19.701 or a comprehensive subcontracting plan, as described in DFARS 219.702, a copy of the plan shall be submitted with the proposal. The subcontracting plan is a part of the cost/business section of the proposal and will not be included in the page count.</p>
<p>DOD Subcontracting Goals (http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/statistics/goals.htm)</p>
<p>B. WIDE AREA WORK FLOW NOTICE: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ .</p>
<p>C. ASSOCIATE CONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS. Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p>D. ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION. Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Apr 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/index.html .</p>

<p>G. Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) and forward pricing rate recommendations (FPRR's) should submit them with their proposal.</p>
<p>H. Pursuant to Far 22.805, a preaward clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past two years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance from the OFCCP.</p>

The purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation is to acquire commercial manufacturing services for the fabrication and assembly of the PCB design. The purchase order (PO) will have two (2) separately priced (quoted) requirements and deliveries: contract line items (CLINs) 0001 - 1st Article Units (Basic); and 0002 - 1st Production Units (Option 1).</p>
<p>Under CLIN 0001 - 1st Article Units (Basic): the contractor shall fabricate and assemble the PCB design provided by the government (DMEA) per the latest revision of the IPC-2222 Class-2 standard for Sectional Design Standard on Rigid Organic Printed Boards and the IPC-1601 standard for Printed Board Handling and Storage Guidelines (see &lsquo;Readme_DMEA.txt' for additional requirements). The contractor shall fabricate 600 bare PCBs (60 panels of 10 boards each) based on the Gerber files provided as GFI (see Appendix A for a notional panel layout). The contractor shall implement an optimal means to separate assembled PCBs from the panels without damaging the assembled PCBs (e.g., tab routing, v-scoring, etc.) The contractor shall visually inspect the 600 fabricated PCBs (60 panels of 10 boards each). The contractor shall ensure that the 600 fabricated PCBs (60 panels of 10 boards each) to be delivered are free from any visual and manufacturing defects. The contractor shall perform opens and shorts testing on the fabricated PCBs. The contractor shall ensure that the 600 fabricated PCBs (60 panels of 10 boards each) to be delivered are free from any opens and shorts. The contractor shall assemble 20 PCB assemblies (PCBAs). The contractor shall visually inspect the 20 PCBAs per the latest revision of the IPC-A-610 Class-3 standard. All PCB assemblies must pass Class-3 level criteria of the latest IPC A-610 revision. The contractor shall resolve any issues/defects discovered by this inspection. The contractor shall ensure that all inspections are performed by a current IPC-A-610 certified inspector. The contractor shall provide the name(s), certificate number(s), and certification expiration date(s) of the person(s) performing all the inspections per the IPC A-610 Class-3 standard. The contractor shall deliver the 20 PCBAs, the residual PCBs in panel form, the IPC-A-610 non acceptable/defect classified PCBAs, and the updated pick and place file to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The 20 PCBAs, the residual PCBs in panel form, the IPC-A-610 non acceptable/defect classified PCBAs, and the updated pick and place file shall be delivered no later than 7 weeks ARO (see DD Form 1423, A001). The government will visually inspect the 20 delivered PCBAs per the latest revision of the IPC-A-610 Class-3 standard. The duration of the government review and inspection will be no more than four (4) weeks. The contractor shall replace any PCBs and PCBAs that do not pass the review and inspection of the government. The contractor shall assemble the replacements in accordance with above. The contractor shall deliver the replacements to DMEA no later than four (4) weeks after date of award for the replacements. The government will review and inspect the replacements. Any parts or material will be provided as Government Furnished Property (GFP) by DMEA. The contractor shall deliver the residual components and panels once the requirement of 20 PCBs is met (see DD 1423 A002). To avoid common failure conditions (e.g., internal PCB delamination, component wire bond damage, component die damage, internal component cracks, etc.), all components susceptible to moisture induced damage must be manufactured, packaged/assembled, and handled per the following relevant standards (as applicable): J-STD-020 Joint IPC/JEDEC standard for moisture/reflow sensitivity classification for non-hermetic solid state surface mount devices; J-STD-033 Joint IPC/JEDEC standard for handling, packing, shipping, and use of moisture/reflow sensitive surface mount devices; and IPC-1601 Printed Board Handling and Storage Guidelines. New factory sealed MSD components delivered to the contractor from the government will not undergo a desiccation or baking process prior to the processing of such components. Per all pertinent standards, all excess MSD components returned to the government shall at a minimum be sealed in a moisture barrier pack with a Humidity Indicator Card (HIC) and desiccant, shall include a written indication of the total floor exposure time limit and environment conditions for each device, and shall be delivered in dry packing. All moisture barrier packs shall be at least 11-months from its "Sealed Bag Shelf Life" expiration date, and they must be individually labeled with the Floor Exposure Time Limit, its corresponding Environment Conditions, and the appropriate Moisture Classification (J-STD-020/033) including its applicable MSD Level (1-6). The contractor shall take proper precautions while processing any and all MSD components to avoid reaching the initial floor exposure time limit of each individual device.</p>
<p>Under CLIN - 0002 1st Production Units (OPTION 1): the contractor shall assemble 400 additional PCBAs in accordance with CLIN 0001 above. The contractor shall deliver the assembled PCBAs no later than 4 weeks after date of award (see DD Form 1423, A003). Testing criteria and COR acceptance will be based upon a comparison of assembly drawings and COR accepted CLIN 0001 - 1st Article Units (Basic) including an examination of the electrical properties and other required CLIN 0001 testing.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency Contracting Services Office-Battle Creek has a brand name requirement for APC Uninterrupted Power Supply. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) SP4707-12-Q-0061. Place of performance is Battle Creek, Michigan. Inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at destination, Battle Creek, Michigan.
<p><br />This is a total small business set aside. This requirement falls under NAICS code 334119 and the size standard of 1,000 employees will be used. The single evaluation factor for award is lowest-price, technically acceptable. The resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Only NEW equipment is being solicited. Remanufactured or refurbished equipment, as defined in FAR 11.001, is technically unacceptable. Trade-in or exchange of old equipment is not available.</p>
<p>This requirement is being offered on a brand name only basis. In order to be considered technically acceptable, vendors must offer the exact product described below. Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Offers with quantities of less than requested or products that differ from those requested will be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Line Item Brand Name Description Quantity<br />0001 SMT1500RM2U SMART UPS 1500VA LCD RM 2U 120V 17 each</p>
<p>Please include your CAGE code with your quote.</p>
<p>Submit written questions regarding this acquisition to the following email addresses:<br />amanda.geissler@dla.mil. Questions must be received no later than Monday, June 18, 2012, at 9 a.m. ET. Please place "SP4707-12-Q-0061" in the subject line of your e-mail message. Questions received after Monday, June 18, 2012, at 9 a.m. ET, WILL NOT be answered. Telephone calls WILL NOT be accepted at any time. Questions submitted via telephone WLL NOT be answered. It is the responsibility of the vendor to monitor FedBizOpps for amendments.</p>
<p>Offers are due by Wednesday, June 20, 2012, at 4 p.m. ET. Offers must be submitted by e-mail to both amanda.geissler@dla.mil, or by FAX (269) 961-4226.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6, only APC equipment meets the Government's requirement. APC UPS equipment meets specific DLA CERT, STIG and other Information Assurance requirements. All replacement batteries, network management modules, monitoring software and telecomm rack rails are from APC. If another vendor is used, DLA Logistics Information Service will also need to purchase replacement batteries, network monitoring cards, monitoring software and rack rails from this vendor. DLA Logistics Information Service is required to procure IT equipment that will conform to the standardization of IT equipment within the agency. Also, this allows for interchangeability of components as required. This is to ensure that all PLFA's use standard like equipment and will not fall into a proprietary system of maintenance and failure. Keeping one vendor greatly increases the response time in detecting vulnerabilities, testing patches and applying to production equipment. Mixing vendor maintenance throughout the network has the potential to cause infrastructure instability.</p>

Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.

Mission and Installation Contracting Command Chief, Supply and Small Services Branch BOX 339500, MS 19 JBLM, WA  98433-9500 Facsimile number 253-967-3844 <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Forest Service is in need of hazardous fuel reduction and stand improvement activities to reduce the tree density and improve the overall health and condition of the stand based on the prescribed objectives.

The goal of these projects are to reduce the possibility of a stand replacing fire burning through the units with lethal consequences to the mature overstory while providing a uniform fuel bed to burn in more desirable conditions. These projects will leave the dominant, co-dominant and intermediate conifer trees intact.
<p>This solicitation is for slashing, lopping, scattering and/or piling activities on the Townsend Ranger District and/or Helena Ranger District and/or Lincoln Ranger District of the Helena National Forest and/or the White Sulphur Springs Ranger District, and/or Belt Creek Ranger District, and/or Musselshell Ranger District, and/or Judith Ranger District, and/or the Rocky Mountain Ranger District of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies, and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the areas specified. All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services will be performed over the entire unit.</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: Specifications /Statement of Work: The vendor shall process captured gas from a clean cryo-pumped vacuum chamber containing approximately 65 percent xenon, 25 percent nitrogen, 5 percent oxygen, and trace amounts of other air constituents. No hazardous or corrosive gases are present. Approximately 20 bottles, containing up to 30,000 liters of xenon, are to be refined and propulsion grade xenon provided to NASA. NASA will provide the 20 bottles to the supplier containing up to 30,000 liters of xenon. The 20 bottles are to be immediately shipped back to NASA once their contents have been extracted by the vendor. Care should be taken to track the bottles and ship them in a timely manner to avoid misplacing them, which can delay payment on the contract. NASA requires up to 30,000 liters of ultra high purity, propulsion grade 99.999+ percent xenon be delivered in a Type 2 or Type K steel compressed gas cylinders that are rated for greater than 2000 psig internal pressure and meet or exceed DOT CFR 49 regulations. The bottles shall nominally be 9 inches in diameter and 51 inches tall, not including the cylinder valve, with approximately 44 L internal volume at 21 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere pressure. Each of the bottles shall be filled with no more than 5,000 liters of xenon. Each bottle shall have a rare-gas valve with bellows seal to eliminate stem leakage and a CGA 580 valve fitting. The cylinders will be provided by the manufacturer and must have at least 2 years remaining prior to the required cylinder retest date. The cylinder demurrage costs shall be included in this order. The measured xenon purity shall be greater than or equal to 99.999 percent and meet the requirements for impurities listed below by measuring the impurities in each individual bottle. The xenon impurity level requirements are: less than or equal to 0.1 ppm oxygen (O2), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm water (H2O), less than or equal to 0.5 ppm carbon monoxide (CO), less than or equal to 0.5 ppm carbon dioxide (CO2), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm carbon tetra-fluoride (CF4), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm total hydrocarbons (THC), less than or equal to 1 ppm nitrogen (N2), less than or equal to 2 ppm hydrogen (H2), less than or equal to 5 ppm krypton (Kr), less than or equal to 1 ppm argon (Ar), less than or equal to 10.4 ppm total impurities, and the remaining balance xenon. A certificate of analysis is required for each cylinder to verify purity requirements. Lot impurities or measured impurities prior to any xenon transfer are not valid. Individual bottle certificates after xenon transfer is completed are required. Impurities for all constituents listed above shall be measured and shall be less than the maximum acceptable levels identified. The xenon impurity measurement accuracy shall be: less than or equal to 0.1 ppm oxygen (O2), less than or equal to 0.05 ppm water (H2O), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm carbon monoxide (CO), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm carbon dioxide (CO2), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm carbon tetra-fluoride (CF4), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm total hydrocarbons (THC), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm nitrogen (N2), less than or equal to 0.5 ppm hydrogen (H2), less than or equal to 0.1 ppm krypton (Kr), and less than or equal to 0.1 ppm argon (Ar). Each delivered xenon bottle shall be analyzed for the impurities listed above. A certificate containing the amount of xenon in liters at standard temperature and pressure, the actual measured impurity values for that bottle, and measurement accuracy for each impurity must be provided with each bottle. The quantity of xenon ordered shall be the quantity after bottle analysis is completed. Any bottle that fails to comply with the above requirements for measured impurity levels shall be rejected. Any bottle that does not have an accompanying certificate of measured impurity levels for that bottle shall be rejected. Any xenon bottle that does not comply with the minimum detection level and accuracy for impurity measurement as stated shall be rejected.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

<p>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br />At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>The Division of Cardiovascular Sciences of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans to establish one (1) Coordinating Center as part of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) renewal. The JHS also involves a Field Center, Training and Education Center and a Community Outreach Center. Awards for the JHS are anticipated to be made on or about June 1, 2013.<br /><br />
<p>The JHS is a multi-center investigation of predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 5,301 African-Americans living in Hinds, Madison, and Rankin Counties surrounding the Jackson, MS metropolitan area. The JHS represents an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study to increase data collection in an African American population, and improve access to and the participation of African American populations and scientists in biomedical research and professions. The JHS was initiated in 1998 as a collaborative effort among three Jackson-area academic institutions. At the close of the current contracts in May 2013, the JHS will have completed three back-to-back cohort examinations that have produced extensive longitudinal data on traditional and putative CVD risk factors, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors and biochemical analytes; measures of subclinical disease from echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart, aorta and abdomen; and stored biological samples. Eighty-two percent of the surviving JHS participants (N = 4,203) completed Exam 2; projected retention for Exam 3 is 80% (N = 4,082). In addition, the JHS has conducted annual cohort follow-up contacts for incident clinical events of interest, a variety of community education and outreach activities to promote healthy lifestyles to reduce disease risk burden, and level-appropriate academic training programs to promote and support public health research.<br /><br />The objectives of the renewal of the JHS program are to:<br />1) Support dedicated time for JHS investigators to conduct data analysis and prepare manuscripts using the wealth of data collected.<br />2) Facilitate access to study resources and expertise in order to:<br />&bull; Engage researchers beyond the JHS, including early career investigators, in collaborative analysis of existing data to produce high quality publications.<br />&bull; Serve as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students to help ameliorate the shortage of minority biomedical researchers.<br />&bull; Serve as a platform for ancillary studies.<br />3) Conduct annual phone interviews with participants to identify interim hospitalizations and outpatient medical visits, convey information about the JHS, and serve as a vehicle to recruit for ancillary studies.<br />4) Continue clinical events identification, investigation, and validation to improve statistical power for risk prediction and hypothesis testing.<br />5) Perform community health education activities to disseminate health promotion and prevention messages in the Jackson community.</p>
<p>NHLBI plans to support one (1) Coordinating Center, one (1) Field Center, up to two (2) Training and Education Centers, and one (1) Community Outreach Center. THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE COORDINATING CENTER ONLY. <br /><br />The Coordinating Center shall be responsible for overall study coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. The Contractor will maintain via subcontracts or other arrangements a Central Laboratory to manage the JHS stored biological samples; an Image Repository to manage JHS cardiac CT and MRI scans and echocardiograms; a formal collaboration with the ARIC study Coordinating Center for clinical events validation; and other subcontracts as required for study operations.</p>

This is a combined synopsis solicitation for a commercial product prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is full and open as it is not anticipated that at least two small businesses providing the product of a small business can provide this product.  This request for proposal N00174-12-C-0018 is the only written solicitation, which will be issued, unless amended. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334511 size standard 750 Employees.

Travel to Czech Republic required in accordance with the attached statement of work.

UNLESS AVAILABLE VIA Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) THE OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS REFERENCING APPLICABLE NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD STATED ABOVE: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports, FAR 52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance.
  The following clauses are also applicable to this requirement: FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation  Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitations minimum criteria at the lowest price. The following provisions are also applicable to this requirement: FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required Implementing Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items, with reference to, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-39, 52.222-50, 52.223-9, 52.225-1, 52.225-13 and 52.232-33. Addendum to 52.212-4 includes DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation.
  52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items: the evaluation factors are as follows, listed in descending order of importance, unless otherwise stated.  

 Offerors are required to follow the specific instructions in submitting their information.  Failure to do so may result in the Offerors submission determined unacceptable and ineligible for award.   The Contracting Officer or a designee upon receipt to ensure compliance with the instructions contained in this combined synopsis, shall screen each Offerors submission.  Elimination of an Offeror for failure to follow the specific instructions in the combined synopsis is at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1 - Technical 

The Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements that are specified in the Statement of Work (SOW).
  The Offeror must provide documentation that proves they meet or exceed the salient characteristics listed in the attachment.  The Offerors technical approach must demonstrate the necessary skills, knowledge, and capabilities to successfully perform all tasks in the SOW.  

Equipment  Specification for Low Profile Night Vision Goggles (attachment (1) of SOW)
Training  3.2.1 of SOW

The Offerors proposal will be evaluated based on its technical approach for accomplishing the requirements as defined in the SOW.  NO PRICING IS TO BE PROVIDED IN THE TECHNICAL APPROACH.


Factor 2 -	 Past Performance: The past performance evaluation will be performed by the Procurement Division personnel.

The Government will evaluate past performance for current relevancy within the last two years based on how well the Contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, size, scope, and complexity.
 The Contractor shall have a past performance that demonstrates successful execution and delivery of services in scope and type cited in the SOW. The Government will evaluate the Offerors demonstrated past or current effort. When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the Offeror and its proposed major subcontractors as it relates to all solicitation requirements. Basis of Evaluation: Evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an Offerors likelihood of success in performing this requirement as indicated by the Offerors record of past performance. The Government will also evaluate promptness and effectiveness of any necessary corrective action.
 The Government may also evaluate information gathered independently of the Offerors submission to assess past performance (i.e., Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPARs)). Quality of performance is defined as the level of past performance provided which will be used as an indicator of the Offerors probable performance as it relates to this acquisition. Offerors that would be eliminated from the competitive range solely based on negative findings in past performance will be given an opportunity to address such findings. A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of past performance can become an important consideration in the source selection process.
 Adverse Past Performance may result in an overall High-Risk rating. The Offeror is reminded to include all relevant past efforts, including demonstrated correction actions, in its proposal. Any Offeror lacking relevant past performance history may be evaluated on past performance information from predecessor companies, and key personnel with experience relevant to the instant acquisition. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or where past performance information is not available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. An Unknown Risk rating will be given.  Past performance evaluation adjectival ratings are described in the table below: 

ADJECTIVAL
RATING	DESCRIPTION
Exceptional	The Offerors performance met contractual requirements and exceeded many to the Governments benefit.
  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective action(s) taken by the Contractor were highly effective.
Very Good	The Offerors performance met contractual requirements and exceeded some to the Governments benefit.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective action taken by the Contractor were effective.
Satisfactory	The Offerors performance met contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor appeared or were satisfactory.
Marginal	The Offerors performance did not meet some contractual requirements.
  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflected a serious problem for which the Contractor had not identified corrective actions.  The Contractors proposed actions appeared only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.
Unsatisfactory	The Offerors performance did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery was not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contained a serious problem(s) for which the Contractors corrective actions appeared or were ineffective.

The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFP.
 However, other types of contracts may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Trends showing improving or deteriorating performance will also be considered. 

The contractor shall provide three past performance references that reflect recent relevant experience performed within the past two years. Provide the following information for each:

a)	Contracting activity and address
b)	Technical representative/Contracting Officers Representative (COR) name and telephone number
c)	Contract number
d)	Type of contract
e)	Contract price
f)	Period of performance
g)	Brief description of the program and discussion of the relevance of the contract to this SOW

In addition, the Government intends to review the Governments Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) rating of an Offerors past performance of relevant contracts.
 In the event the Government cannot obtain adequate PPIRS rating information regarding a particular Offeror, the Government shall review relevant past performance information obtained from other sources. In addition, when subcontractors/teaming partners are proposed to perform significant parts of the effort, their past performance/ corporate experience shall also be evaluated. 

Factor 3 - Price:
Price will be evaluated by Procurement Division personnel.

In determining the overall value of the proposal, price is less important than the personnel resources, technical approach, corporate relevant experience, and past performance. Price will not receive an adjectival rating. The Offerors proposed payment schedule will be evaluated.
 When evaluating the price proposal, a determination will be made as to the Offerors price reasonableness and completeness. 

Any and all questions must be submitted 5 days before close of solicitation.  No questions will be accepted after that time.  Responses must be received no later than 1:00 p.m. EST on July 13, 2012.  Provide responses to Georgia Warder , Code A23A, Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division (NSWC IHD), Procurement Division, 4072 North Jackson Road Suite 118, Code A23A Indian Head, MD 20640-5115.

The responsibility to send out the Present/Past Performance Survey rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity. Once the Present/Past Performance Survey is completed by your POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be releasable. Present/Past Performance Survey shall be sent directly back to 374 CONS/LGCBB from evaluating agencies/companies, not later than 3 Jul 2012, 1000 hours, JST by either e-mail (tomoko.harashima.jp@us.af.mil) FAX (042-530-3319 or 011-81-42-530-3319 from the United States) . Offerors are responsible for ensuring that their reference sources receive the Present/Past Performance Survey in time to complete and return the Present/Past Performance Survey to 374th Contracting Squadron. No Present/Past Performance Survey will be accepted directly from the offeror being evaluated. The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation:</p>
<p>Based on evaluation results, each offeror will be assigned either acceptable or unacceptable rating as follows:</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br /><br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Past performance evaluation will be performed based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Recency: Each contract will be confirmed whether the contract has been completed during the past three (3) years from this solicitation release date, or is currently in progress.</p>
<p>2. Relevancy: A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures, and/or teaming partners will be made. Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, in accordance with the work scope described in paragraph 1 of the PWS, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy score for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. <br /><br />3. Quality: Quality rating is assigned based on the Quality Rating Criteria evaluated under paragraph a through g of Past Performance Survey (Solicitation Attachment 5).</p>
<p>Note, acceptability shall be determined based upon an integrated assessment of recency, relevancy, and quality for all past performance records considered. An unacceptable rating in one each (i.e., recency, relevancy or quality) for a particular record does not necessarily mean the offeror shall be deemed to have an overall unacceptable past performance.</p>
<p>(d) If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontractor Consent: Present/Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p>(f) Documents submitted in response to this solicitation must be fully responsive to and consistent with the following:</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />Relevant Excerpt from Solicitation Provision <br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation of technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PRESENT/PAST PERFORMANCE<br /><br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS:</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors will be evaluated on an integrated assessment of price, technical acceptability and present/past performance. The Government will award a contract to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror with acceptable past performance, who is responsible and whose proposal will provide the best value to the Government. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in provision FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including all options. Single award will result from this evaluation. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including options. The Government shall evaluate technical acceptability and past performance information submitted only from the lowest priced offeror under this acquisition. If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical and past performance acceptability standard as defined in Addenda to FAR 52.212-1, the contract will be awarded to the lowest offeror with acceptable technical and past performance. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical and/or past performance standard of acceptability as defined in Addenda to FAR 52.212-1, it will be eliminated from consideration for award. The Government will then evaluate the next low offeror's technical and past performance acceptability as defined in Addenda to FAR 52.212-1 in the same manner. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical and past performance standard of acceptability as defined in Addenda to FAR 52.212- <br />1. In order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 6 and Far Part 17, the price equivalent to the 6 months extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated separately, and will not be factored as part of the total evaluated price for award. The Government will multiply the offeror's proposed Price by a quantity equivalent to 6 months for CLINs 0001 including Options under FAR 52.217-9, in order to evaluate the extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8.</p>
<p>B. Technical acceptability defined as: proof of Education, Licensure and Certification that will be evaluated to verify the qualification as required mandatory in paragraph 1.2. of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Technical acceptability is acceptable when the offeror submits proof of the mandatory Education, Licensure, Certification and Experience (Resume) to the level as required in the PWS and this Request for Proposal (RFP). The offeror is requested to submit the followings for assessment of technical acceptability in accordance with Paragraph 1.2 of the PWS:</p>
<p>1. Certificate of completion for a medical assisting program recognized and accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) or the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools (ABHES), or, equivalent combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience (i.e., military training).<br />2. Copy of valid, current, unrestricted state certified medical assistant/certified nursing assistant license.<br />3. Current Basic Life Support (BLS) certification.<br />4. Resume (at least 12 months of experience within the last 36 months, in an inpatient or outpatient clinic setting)</p>
<p>A technical proposal which fails to provide copies of "ALL" the required Qualification Information shall be rated as "Unacceptable" and will not be considered for award. The proposals must "Pass" all of the Qualification Information requirements in order to be determined "Acceptable". There will be no point scores assigned, only "Pass" or "Fail" ratings. In order to be considered for award, there must be a "Pass" rating for every required Qualification Information. In addition, the Government will use the following technical acceptable/unacceptable ratings definitions when assigning technical overall ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.</p>
<p>Rating Definition <br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p><br />C. Using Present/Past Performance Survey, the Government shall seek performance information on only the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror based on (1) the Past Performance Reference List provided by the offerors and (2) Past Performance Survey independently obtained from governmental and commercial sources. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's performance risk (i.e. the Government's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully performing the effort described in this solicitation), based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance on relevant contract.</p>
<p>C. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in ADDENDA TO 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, paragraph C. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions.</p>
<p>D. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<p>Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation</p>
<p>Date: June 12, 2012</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSA), intends to negotiate with Peggy R. Barker on a sole source basis for providing a senior-level Survey Statistician with in depth knowledge of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to assist for a partial redesign already in progress to occur in 2014 and 2015. During this next year, products and procedures for the Questionnaire Field Test (QFT) must be refined and finalized. Field Interviewers (FI) training and QFT conducted, results analyzed and necessary changes made to the questionnaires and procedures for the subsequent "dress rehearsal". The basis for restricting competition is the authority 13.106-1 (b) because only one source is reasonably available to satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Two training sessions for FIs participating in the QFT will be held in August, 2012. The contractor will contribute to development of the training materials, attend a session in either Cincinnati or Rockville and submit a report to SAMHSA on the meeting.</p>
<p>The contractor will observe QFT interviewing in the field, report to SAMHSA on these observations, and contribute to data analysis from the QFT.</p>
<p>The Contractor will contribute to the OMB clearance package, all FI training materials, and the final instruments and procedures for the redesign "dress rehearsal."</p>
<p>Regular ongoing work: training</p>
<p>NSDUH training sessions will be held during 2012-13, including QFT training, main study Veteran FI training, and Supervisor training for the QFT and "dress rehearsal". The contractor will observe and submit reports to the agency on these sessions.</p>
<p>The MHSS is a special NSDUH study conducted since 2008 from which population estimates of adult mental illness are produced. The contractor must have in-depth knowledge of this study.

For over 15 years, Ms. Barker, a senior level survey statistician, served as leader of the NSDUH Instrumental Team (I-Team) a small group of survey statisticians with responsibility for questionnaire design and testing, and oversight of all aspects of field work quality control on the NSDUH.</p>
<p>She has led efforts to redesign the questionnaire for the 2015 survey, including overseeing cognitive testing and subsequent revisions to the questionnaire, as well as contributing to the overall schedule of implementation of the design. She contributes to publications of NSDUH data every year, including regular reports, journal articles, and methodological studies. She has had a lead role in development and testing of the questionnaire and procedures for the MHSS, beginning with developing and analyzing results from a Feasibility Study in 2007. <br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to determine, whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above. Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement as articulated above.<br /><br />No Solicitation document is available.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: CONSULTATION ON CSAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OTP REGULATIONS<br /><br /><br />Solicitation #: 12-233-SOL-00396<br />Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation<br /><br />Date: June 13, 2012<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />Under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)<br />Regulation (42 CFR Part 8) compliance with narcotic treatment standards are monitored and enforced through a process of on-site surveys and inspections by accrediting bodies. Under this Regulation, an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) shall be considered for certification by SAMHSA if the program is accredited by a SAMHSA-approved accreditation body. Accreditation, along with additional information, serves as the basis by which SAMHSA will make the determination the opioid treatment services are provided by qualified individuals and that the OTP is in compliance with standards that address the medical use of opioid drugs. The basis for restricting competition is the authority 13.106-1(b) because only one source is reasonably available to satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />For-cause inspections are directed toward programs that are suspected of violating established Federal opioid standards, accreditation elements, providing substandard treatment, threatening the public health or being a possible source of diverted medications. In carrying out these responsibilities, the consultant supports the Director of the Division of Pharmacologic Therapies (DPT) and the Team Leader of the Certification and Waiver Team, DPT, CSAT, and SAMHSA in programs and services of national importance. Understanding of the substance abuse and health delivery systems is essential, as is knowledge of pharmacologic treatment.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE<br /><br />The objective of this purchase order is to obtain expert consultation to CSAT to help assure that CSAT's regulation of OTPs is consistent with the experience from the past, and that OTPs provide treatment in accordance with accepted standards, regulations, and guidelines. DPT seeks assistance in facilitating implementation and interpretation of regulations, guidelines, inspectional findings, and proposed compliance actions:<br /><br />&bull; Reviews individual patient exceptions and treatment program exemptions on site three days/week and off-site via extranet at least two days/week. Advises higher management within DPT on said exceptions and exemptions;<br />&bull; Reviews reports from State, Federal inspections and provides advice on appropriate follow-up actions.<br />&bull; Reviews existing emergency medication distribution plans to develop a DPT strategy on emergency medication distribution programs.<br />&bull; Monitors States for emerging disasters that could affect continuity of care, then notifies DPT Team leader with recommendations.<br />&bull; Trains incoming and incumbent staff of DPT on compliance activities;<br />&bull; Conducts inspections (up to six per year) to treatment programs for cause; and<br />&bull; Provides technical assistance to new treatment programs.<br />&bull; Provides guidance on compliance with Federal confidentiality and privacy regulations.<br /><br />SOURCE RECOMMENDATION<br /><br />Mr. Elsworth Dory is uniquely qualified to do this work. Formerly, Mr. Dory held the position of Investigator, Narcotic Treatment Program Team, in the Division of Scientific Investigations, Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He works with large Governmental, private and corporate organizations, Federal, and State decision makers and consortia of community treatment programs and agencies. He helps to plan, evaluate, implement and/or improve the delivery of treatment services. Since 1972, his projects have ranged from assisting over 1,000 corporate clients to design, and implement treatment program plans to establish and maintain treatment facilities according to and in compliance with The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974.<br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above. Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement as articulated above. . Any interested source, in order to meet HHS requirements, will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement that he/she is a recognized expert in the above tasks. <br /><br />No Solicitation document is available. Capability statements shall be received by 06/18/2012 , no later than 12:00 p.m. (EDT), to the point of contact (POC) listed in this announcement.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Responses to Questions from Industry (Motorcycle Safety Training)<br><br>Question # 1<br>Question:  Which version of the BRC2 is the government requesting the vendor to provide - the BRC2 Skills Practice RiderCourse or the BRC2 License Waiver RiderCourse?<br><br>The Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) Course Descriptions list two distinct BRC2 RiderCourses: BRC2 Skills Practice RiderCourse, and BRC2 License Waiver RiderCourse. The BRC2 Skills Practice RiderCourse is designed for riders who have successfully completed the BRC or who possess basic operational skills and do not require a classroom test.  The BRC2 License Waiver RiderCourse is designed for riders that do not possess a state motorcycle license or endorsement and is recognized as a driver's license test waiver in many states.  The BRC2 License Waiver RiderCourse has a formal test associated with the instruction. <br><br>According to the statement of work (SOW) submitted for this proposal, the government is requesting the vendor to provide BRC2 one day instructional classroom and hands-on motorcycle skills course. The SOW, paragraph 1.8.4, requires the contractor to submit test score (skills and knowledge) results to the COR which would be required for the BRC2 License Waiver RiderCourse but not for the BRC Skills Practice RiderCourse.  The current Army Traffic<br>Safety Training Program training provided to Ft. Hood is instructing the BRC2 Skills Practice RiderCourse.<br> <br>Given the nature of the Army's progressive training system per AR 385-10, 11-9(7)b.(1), Soldiers attending this training should have completed the BRC and should already possess a driver's license with the motorcycle endorsement.  <br><br><br>ANSWER:<br><br>We are requiring the ERC/BRC2 for sportbike operators (required by III Corps Cmd Policy SAFETY-02), as taught by the ATSTP.  Eight riders is the max (in the State of Texas; with special credentials) for each course. The students will already be licensed.<br><br><br><br>Question # 2 <br><br>To satisfy the military requirement for sport bike training, I am wondering if the MSRC is what you were shooting for in this solicitation?  It will make a big difference in submitted bids, as most instructors can teach the ERC/BRC2, however, there is a much smaller group certified to teach the MSRC. This course is a DOD/MSF course.  It is recognized by TX DPS, but is not one of their courses, and they do not teach it.<br><br>The Motorcycle Safety Foundation has three different levels of rider's training:<br> <br>BRC:  This is the beginner rider's course<br> <br>BRC2 (Formerly the ERC):  This is a slightly more detailed course than the BRC.  It reinforces the basic skills from the BRC and introduces only a couple of new concepts.  It is for any type of motorcycle/riders.<br> <br>ARC/MSRC (Advanced Rider Course/Military Sport bike Rider Course):  This course was designed by the MSF upon payment from the D.O.D.  It is designed for sport bike riders.  This course teaches different posture positions on the motorcycle, advanced braking and cornering, and trail braking in curves, to list a few differences.  This course has a maximum of 12 students, as do the rest of the MSF courses.  However, even if there are only 2 or 3 students, this course REQUIRES TWO instructors at all times for the riding exercises.<br> <br><br>ANSWER:<br><br>We are requiring the ERC/BRC2 for sportbike operators (required by III Corps Cmd Policy SAFETY-02), as taught by the ATSTP.  Eight riders is the max (in the State of Texas; with special credentials) for each course.  The students will already be licensed.<br>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Separate lists are provided for products that meet the Level I and Level II requirements. In order to be eligible for award, the offeror must be an NSA-certified U.S. TEMPEST product manufacturer, eligible to use a commercial TEMPEST test service facility which NSA has certified, in performance of this contract.

<DESC>Stream Access Question:<br /><br />Q -Is it the contractor's responsibility to gain access to stream segments through private parcels in some cases? What level of effort is expected to gain access, especially in cases where the landowner cannot be reached or cannot be determined without significant effort? Or, even in cases where access is denied?<br /><br />A -We don't have any stream segments on private land to be surveyed for this project. With intermingled ownership, there may be locations where the contractor may need to go around private to get back on a federally owned stream segments. To the best of our knowledge, all stream segments on federally owned land should be accessible via federal property or county roads.

<p><strong>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br /></strong>At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p><strong>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</strong></p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>Q1) What is the required number of DEFACs per day?  Do we have to serve out of all the kitchens at the same time in the camp? Or can combine and feed out of less DFAC?<br>A1. The 48th can utilize seven DEFACs at once. Each of the DEFACs is exactly the same.  Each has a capacity to hold 128 Soldiers each. Total capacity for all seven DEFACs is 896. An accurate estimate of how many DEFACs per day will depend on the 48th's timeline.  In the absence of a timeline we'll assume that the 48th wants to feed their Soldiers as quickly as possible. In that case, the minimum number of DEFACs that must be open per day are as follows:<br><br>10 August 2012<br>	Breakfast: 4 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>11 August 2012<br>	Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>12 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>13 August 2012<br>	Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>14 August 2012<br>	Breakfast: 6 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 6 DEFACs<br>15 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 2 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 2 DEFACs<br>	<br>21 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 0 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 4 DEFACs<br>22 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 4 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>23 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>24 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>25 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 7 DEFACs<br>26 August 2012<br>	Breakfast: 7 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 2 DEFACs<br>27 August 2012	<br>        Breakfast: 2 DEFACs<br>	Dinner: 1 DEFAC<br><br>Q2) Can the vendor establishes his own central location for preparing meals and then serve in the DEFACs?<br>A2. Yes<br><br>Q3) Are the 650 & 500 field rations stated in the solicitation included in the overall numbers per day? <br>A3. Yes. The 650 number is what is planned for mermited chow.  The 500 field rations are for contingency, and we will give the vendor plenty of time to react per the solicitation.<br><br>Q4) Are the ovens single or double stacked?<br>A4. 2 ovens per DEFAC single stacked.<br><br>Q5) Is there a dishwasher on site for our use?<br>A5. No dishwasher on site.<br><br>Q6) Is there any refrigeration/ freezer available to us in any of the kitchens?<br>A6. One refrigerator and freezer in each DEFAC.<br>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0001 is to (a) make changes to Solicitation DG133W-12-RP-0085   and (b) respond to questions received concerning the solicitation.
<p>A.	Solicitation DG133W12RP0085 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Section B. 4, Reconditioned Radiosondes, paragraph two (2) is amended to read as follows:</p>
<p>For each reconditionable radiosonde returned by the Government to the Contractor under this contract, the Contractor shall furnish, under Item 0001 of this contract, a reconditioned 1680 MHz Global Positioning System Radiosonde.  However, if the Contractor chooses to furnish new 1680 MHz Global Positioning System Radiosondes, the Government shall not furnish the Contractor previously used radiosondes (reconditionable) for refurbishing.</p>
<p><br />2.	Section L.8, Instructions to Offerors, Paragraph 5. is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>
<p>If the offeror is proposing to deliver reconditioned radiosondes (rather than new radiosondes), the offeror shall provide a Reconditioning Plan defining the reconditioning procedures to be used for reconditioning radiosondes in accordance with the Specification referenced as an attachment in Section J of this solicitation.  The offeror shall include a flowchart depicting the reconditioning process and the associated quality assurance process. In addition, the Reconditioning Plan shall identify by document number (including revision number, title and date) test plans, test procedures and quality assurance procedures to be used for reconditioning. If any of these plans and procedures have not previously been submitted to the National Weather Service under predecessor contracts, such documents shall be submitted as part of the Reconditioning Plan.</p>
<p><br />B.	Following are the Government's responses to questions received concerning the solicitation.</p>
<p>Question #1:	The RFP is seeking reconditioned or new radiosondes available on the QPL with an ordering period of 1yr. from date of contract award estimated to be August 2012. Vaisala's RS92 NGP is one model on the QPL list but is not yet in wide use in the NWS' network. Section B.4 states that only Sippican MKIIA "found" radiosondes would be returned for reconditioning but that in the case of replacement with new radiosondes, then either the Sippican or Vaisala radiosondes could be supplied. Please confirm that Vaisla can offer new RS92 NGP radiosondes for this requirement.</p>
<p>Response: The answer is yes. See Paragraph A.1 above, which amends Section B.4 of the RFP.</p>
<p>Question #2:	Section L.8 of the solicitation sets forth submittal requirements for the Reconditioning Plan. In addition to the flowchart specified, is the intent that the actual manufacturing procedures, test plans, test procedures and quality assurance procedures be submitted? Or is the submission requirement to submit a flowchart that shows where each of the procedures, etc. are used during the reconditioning process?</p>
<p>Response: The intention is to provide the National Weather Service (NWS) insight into the radiosonde reconditioning process.  Regarding the second part of the question, the answer is yes.  See Paragraph A.2 above, which amends Section L.8.</p>

<DESC><p>MNIS Mission</p>
<p>The MNIS mission is to provide an information sharing environment enabling commanders to rapidly and effectively share and consume information from US coalition partners and Mission Partners operating across the strategic, operational, and tactical continuum, to include potential federal, state, local, and tribal mission partners. This concept integrates joint force actions with agencies, non-governmental organizations, first responders, and private volunteer organizations within the U.S. as well as in a multinational environment, whether the U.S. is leading the operation or participating as a mission partner. The portfolio of projects accomplishes this through managing two of DoD's prominent information sharing networks, CENTRIXS and Pegasus ICI (Griffin), and by running a robust Combined Federated Battle Logistics Network (CFBLNet) as the coalition information sharing trials and assessments "sandbox" for evaluating new information sharing capabilities and products. Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT) will establish efficiencies throughout the CENTRIXS network topology to enable improved management and capabilities for information sharing. The emerging capability, Unclassified Information Sharing Service (UISS), will establish a DoD-wide enterprise unclassified information sharing capability for users worldwide.<br /><br />MNIS Description:</p>
<p>. CENTRIXS provides multiple communities of interest to enable US, US Coalition Partners and MPs to share information securely and rapidly. CENTRIXS allows for the secure sharing operational/intelligence information in COIs.</p>
<p>. CMNT - is intended to separate the CENTRIXS network from the SIPRNET to provide several enhancements such as the ability to monitor the network for security/availability, the ability to manage the bandwidth of individual CENTRIXS communities of interest and the ability to conduct maintenance on SIPRNET without affecting CENTRIXS services.</p>
<p>. Pegasus ICI (Griffin) provides the ability to connect National-to-National Command and Control (C2) systems for sharing and coordinating among a select group of Allies (commonly referred to as "Five Eyes" - US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Pegasus ICI (Griffin) currently provides email with attachments and Common Operational Picture sharing (tailored).</p>
<p>. CFBLNet provides a year-round network for R&amp;D at a Combined Secret Releasable accreditation level to meet the requirements for a secure test environment to support coalition research, development, testing and ongoing capabilities assessment.</p>
<p>. UISS - provides an efficient, effective, enterprise-level solutions that allows Combatant Commands to share unclassified information with other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, host nations (HNs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations, and other non traditional partners.</p>
<p>The Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS) is an umbrella term used to describe a set of independent and discrete networks or products that are separated by Communities of Interest (COI). CENTRIXS is the US global, secure, information system to support multinational operations with shared, combined command, control and intelligence information up to the SECRET Releasable (REL) level. CENTRIXS is installed in partner nation countries and their military forces after they establish their specific requirements and relate the requirements with the supporting U.S. Combatant Commands (COCOM). The basic mission of CENTRIXS is to support the secure sharing and exchanging of intelligence and operational information through reliable communications connectivity, data manipulation, and automated processes. CENTRIXS networks provide COCOM commanders with enterprise services.</p>
<p>The standard CENTRIXS architecture consists of servers, applications and encryption systems to form an IP-based network. There are approximately over 90 such networks. The MNIS PMO currently has shared Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) responsibility for some of these networks with COCOMs. Current MNIS PMO and vendor services for CENTRIXS support is through an existing contract. This PWS will address FTE support for such work.</p>
<p>Most of the MNIS portfolio's operational capabilities are currently or will be operated at DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC). The Contractor under this requirement shall provide Tier FTE engineering and operations support in the Continental United States (CONUS), and may travel to several different Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations further detailed below. At the time of contract award, the Contractor must be capable of providing U.S. personnel currently exempt from foreign tax status as defined under the current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) / Technical Expert Support Agreement (TESA) or other applicable foreign regulations (as determined by the governments of those countries within which the contractor shall be residing under this contract). The Government will aid the Contractor in facilitating this process. It is expected that the Contractor will be able to provide 80% of proposed FTE support no later than thirty days post award, and 100% of the FTE support no later than sixty days post award. The MNIS PMO is interested in an effective proposed staffing approach from the Contractor that can express an efficient staffing plan to meet the needs of the Government. Historically, there have been 40 FTEs supporting such work within the U.S. and at various COCOM (customer) locations around the world including JCMO (Tampa, FL), EUCOM (Stuttgart, Germany), PACOM (Oahu, Hawaii), AFRICOM (HQ, Stuttgart), CENTCOM (Tampa, FL, Kuwait, and Bahrain) STRATCOM (Tampa, FL, Suffolk, VA),SOUTHCOM (Miami, FL), NORTHCOM (Colorado Spring, CO), and Alexandria, VA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of this requirement is to provide On-Site, MNIS network engineering capability support for a wide range of program management, technical, research and development, procurement and operations/maintenance services to support the operational and strategic use of MNIS capabilities. These objectives include:</p>
<p>. Providing operational users support and training of MNIS capabilities; answering their questions and making recommendations on meeting operational objectives with MNIS capabilties.</p>
<p>. Supporting integration and testing events and efforts from customer sites as required by the MNIS project office. This may include some installation and configuration activity on MNIS assets.</p>
<p>. Assisting MNIS technical teams on deployment of MNIS capabilities at mission partner locations. This may include network infrastructure and enterprise services and other MNIS portfolio capabilities as required.</p>
<p>. Assisting customers with Information Management and facilitation of data inputs in a standardized fashion on MNIS capabilities.</p>
<p>. Assisting MNIS PMO in obtaining customer feedback and input on MNIS capabilities. This feedback may be used to help MNIS adjust to changing environments and correcting deficiencies in MNIS capability.<br /><br />All information released under the previous presolicitation notice and be found at the following link:<br /><br />The Draft RFP was posted to FBO under a pre solicitation notice.&nbsp; Please see Solicitation External Reference:<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DISA/D4AD/DTN/HC1047-12-R-4003_a/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DISA/D4AD/DTN/HC1047-12-R-4003_a/listing.html</a>.<br /><br />The Final RFP is&nbsp; posted as an attachment to this annoucement.

The managerial interface must leverage CRM capability to provide metrics on task completion, workload, and work distribution.  Additionally, users must have the ability to leverage privacy and security settings to tasks containing sensitive information.  <br><br>5. Searches:  The tasking solution software must have a search capability that leverages CRM's inherent search ability, that is capable of executing search inquiries by task, user, key word, document, and other fields relevant to any given task instance. <br><br>6. Extending task capability outside of Tasking solution environment: Tasking solution must possess the capability to incorporate non-licensed users in the tasking solution environment in order for non-licensed users to respond (within the tasking solution environment) to taskings assigned by tasking solution licensed users.    <br><br>7.

Question: This Special Notice states that you are "seeking a firm that can provide a fully functioning, expandable task management software application that operates within the Microsoft (MS) Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM) environment".  While our solution can work with both Microsoft SharePoint and CRM and since CRM relies on SharePoint for many of its functions (such as the Dashboard capability), I just wanted to confirm that the Army's statement of operating "within the CRM environment" is meant to be exclusively CRM or does it allow our application to interface with SharePoint to meet the Army's CRM requirement? <br><br>Answer #1:  The tasking solution should be a "bolt on" application to MS CRM.  In other words it must use CRM as its "operating system", using CRM core processes and BI capability to make the tasking solution work. FORSCOM will leverage CRM's inherent ability to integrate the tasking solution into other MS systems FORSCOM already has in use, such as Outlook, Share Point, and OCS without the need for additional custom software development. <br><br>Through the CRM conduit, the tasking solution would leverage Share Point 2010 capabilities for the purpose of document library searches, Global Access List (GAL) integration, integration and task participation of Non Licensed CRM/Tasking Solution users, and Active Directory integration.  The dashboard interface will not be a function of Share Point, but a function of CRM.<br><br><br>2.  Question: Please provide what version of CRM and/or SharePoint that the Army intends for this Tracker Management Improvement Project to use.<br><br>Answer #2: The SharePoint version we will be using is Share Point 2010. The CRM Version is CRM 2011.<br><br><br>3.  Questions: In paragraph 4 of the requirement, the Notice speaks of task visibility and transparency: "Application must have managerial interface (dashboard) separate from that of Action Officers that allows task searches, tracking, and organization, with the ability to drill down into current working and completed tasks, in order to monitor work at the action officer and collaborate directly with actions officers if required."  Please clarify if this is meant to be for the managerial interface (dashboard) to support the direct collaboration with the action officers or, is the drill down capability simply informing management and any collaboration with the Action Officers would take place through other means that we would provide?<br><br>Answer #3: The required dashboard "drill down" capability and the collaborative "drill down" capability stated in the PWS are separate.  The dashboard capability is an interface provided by CRM that will be available to managerial /leadership level individuals within the organization.  The purpose of this required capability is to provide leadership the ability to view graphical trends and percentages as they pertain to workload, punctuality of task completion, etc...   "Drilling down" in the context of the dashboard interface speaks specifically to the capability of leadership to look at larger subcomponents of an organization and view graphical statistics of that group, then "drill down" into smaller subcomponents of the larger subcomponent organization, in order to view graphical data pertaining to that specific smaller subcomponent organization. This dashboard "drill down" capability must reflect the hierarchy of FORSCOM's staff and corps/division staffs, in order for leadership to "drill down" up to eight levels within an organization in order to view graphical representations of workload and task punctuality.<br><br>	Additionally, leadership should have the ability to conduct searches of specific tasks, in order to "drill down" into the task to view progress and status, identify who is currently working on them, view any collaboration or discussion pertaining to the task, and participate in collaboration or discussion at any time or level within the task as required. <br><br>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>If you feel your firm possesses the ability to provide the software application and applicable services, you must respond by demonstrating your firm's current software application capabilities and technical capability to meet the requirements.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Tomahawk Block IV Full Rate Production (FRP) 9-10. The anticipated contract will be for one base year and one option year. Contract award is planned for the second quarter fiscal year 2012. This requirement includes the hardware manufacture of Canistered Surface Ship Capable, Encapsulated Submarine Torpedo-Tube Launched, and Encapsulated Submarine Vertical Launch Tomahawk Block IV All-Up-Round (AUR) missiles and related hardware/equipment and services. In addition to other related items/services, this may include manufacture of Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) Capsules; SSGN compatible CCLS Retrofit Kits; MK 10 canisters; Special Tooling; Special Test Equipment; Range Safety Systems (RSS) Kits; Flight Test Kits; spares; hardware manufacturing and testing; post-production/post-delivery systems engineering and emergent systems engineering, studies, and other tests; support (or performance) of Flight Testing, Product Acceptance Testing (PAT), and Functional Ground Testing (FGT); Guidance Test Set (GTS) upgrades, support, maintenance, and repair; refurbishment or remanufacture of containers, canisters and capsules; Government Furnished Property maintenance, repair and upgrade; engineering test support; various elements of logistics support; cost reduction and affordability improvements; obsolescence management and resolution; service life assessments and service life extension upgrades for containers, capsules, and canisters; and failure investigations and analyses. NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missiles Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337. Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons Systems (TWS). RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile, and is the only source capable of meeting scheduled thresholds for Fleet load outs of the Tomahawk Block IV missile. Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to conduct taskings under this contract, RMS is the only known source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<a href="mailto:sherry.alexander@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Instrumentation Management Office (IMO), as the materiel developer for the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), is seeking industry information on available products, technologies and methods to further define and refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) embedded Hybrid Network (HyNet TM) or equivalent. PM ITTS is the lead for the acquisition of this capability. NOTE: HyNet is a trademark product and will be annotated as such in this sources sought notice with a "TM" at the end of HyNet. This application is unable to support a superscript.<br><br>Background:<br>The U.S. military has an immediate need to further verify, validate and demonstrate the DSA enabled HyNet TM, or equivalent, by using a minimum of 50 to a maximum of 100 player unit radios deployed by the test & evaluation (T&E) or training communities with two Relay Base Stations that are similar to the Infrastructure Nodes (IN) developed on the Operational Test-Tactical Engagement System Communications Upgrade (OT-TES CU) program. Previous efforts demonstrated the technology by employing four radios and one IN thus bringing the Technology Readiness Level from four to six. These core capabilities, when integrated, will provide a fundamental test and training instrumentation capability that addresses the most critical issues facing the test and training community today:<br><br>- Declining spectrum<br>- Effective, real-time spectrum management in a spectrally complicated environment<br>- Cost effective common test and training solutions that will extend the Army's buying power during times of decreased funding profiles<br>- a test bed framework to validate future architectural components and Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) algorithms under consideration to meet common test and training requirements for Test Instrumentation System and the Army Tactical Engagement Simulation System.<br><br>Detailed Requirements:<br><br>PM ITTS is seeking companies capable of advancing the current capability of the DSA embedded HyNet TM, or equivalent, to support a minimum of 50 to a maximum of 100 player units within more complex test and training scenarios in a field environment. The candidate radio platforms for this effort are the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System Rapid Prototype Initiative (CRIIS RPI) radios currently deployed at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico or the Koos Technical Services (KTS) Range Data System Agility Military Radio (AMR) integrated with the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System Tactical Engagement Simulations System and deployed at Ft. Riley, Kansas.  The Argon ST CRIIS RPI Radio Part Number is 104011 with nomenclature DS-1 to signify Dismounted soldier and LDV-1 for the Low Dynamic Vehicle units. All RPI units operate in the 1350-1390 MHz (L-Band). The KTS AMR Part Number is AMR-US-210. The version of this radio fielded to FT Riley, KS operates in the 210 to 320 MHz band.  <br><br>The DSA enabled HyNet TM, or equivalent, system provides the ability to manage efficient real-time spectrum access on a non-interfering basis and provides for opportunity to access more spectrum (supporting more simultaneous tests/scenarios and higher bandwidths/throughputs to applications) as well as providing higher spectrum utilization and in current spectrum allocations or harvested spectrum. DSA enabled HyNet TM, or equivalent, offers the following benefits to Department of Defense test and training ranges:<br><br>- DSA brings unprecedented levels of frequency agility to enable more efficient use of the spectrum for T&E and training applications including Space Time Position Indication reporting, RTCA, Radio Frequency based geo-pairing and Command and Control applications<br>- DSA enables unprecedented levels of frequency agility by utilizing algorithms that monitor the spectrum and enable effective access without interference<br>- DSA operates with a defined policy in a Time Division Multiple Access network to autonomously identify and manage spectrum resources in real-time enabling maximum time-frequency agility.<br><br>Additional Information:  <br>HyNet TM code was developed under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.  The Government has SBIR data rights to HyNet TM as detailed in DFARS Clause 252.227-7018.  The Application Program Interfaces to HyNet TM, however, are provided with unlimited rights.  <br><br>CRIIS is a completely separate program from the project being described in this sources sought notice.  The objectives of  this project are simply to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing DSA in conjunction with HyNet TM, or equivalent,  on hardware platforms which are currently in the Army inventory and have the potential to be used on test and training ranges to transmit instrumentation data to data collection centers.  <br><br>Argon ST implemented DSA with HyNet TM on OT-TES CU radios on Contract W900KK-09-C-0022 with a period of performance end date of July 31, 2011.  This was accomplished  under a Broad Agency Announcement contract awarded by the Army in support of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology Program.  <br><br>This sources sought is being conducted to determine interested sources and industry capabilities. The Government asks respondents to submit a technical description of the potential solutions or complete capability by addressing the following:<br><br>a. How does your solution interface with the HyNet TM, or equivalent, system? What are its limitations?<br>b. Where has this application been applied in the past and is it available for review?<br>c. How mature is your system? Is it a new development? Does a prototype exist? Is it similar to previous successful developments? Is it an extension or evolution of an existing product or project?<br>d. What components are part of your solution? What part of the solution has to be developed?<br>e. Does your solution address safety and Electromagnetic Interference issues?<br>f. How well does your method withstand environmental conditions (e.g. heat, wind, blowing rain/sand, high/low temperature, etc)?<br><br>This sources sought is an expression of the Government's interest and does not obligate the Government to pay for requested information nor respond to any submissions. No format for your response is specified. Limit your submission to ten (10) pages. Font shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman. Only electronic responses are acceptable. Electronic submissions shall be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format. If you have information in preexisting materials, you may use these materials. In addition to the 10 pages, you may include up to five attachments consisting of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature. The Government is not soliciting proprietary information; however, if submitted, it should be appropriately marked. Please submit responses to Ms. Sherry Alexander (sherry.alexander@us.army.mil) with a courtesy copy to Mr. William Blakeley (william.blakeley@us.army.mil). The Government will not provide acknowledgement of receipt. Response deadline is no later than 4:30 PM Eastern Time on June 18, 2012. Point of contact is Ms. Sherry Alexander at sherry.alexander@us.army.mil.<br><br>

Please submit in accordance with orginal submission guidance prescribed below.  Update 1: See Amendment 0001 & Related Attachments - 06/01/2012  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) on behalf of the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office (PMW 205) has issued Request for Proposal (RFP) number N00039-12-R-0009 for the procurement of the Next Generation Enterprise Network's Transport and Enterprise Services requirements. The Department of the Navy (DON) operates one of the largest intranets in the world, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI).  NMCI provides end-to-end secure Information Technology (IT) services to more than 400,000 seats and 800,000 users, across 2,500+ USN and USMC locations that vary from major bases to single user locations.   NMCI has been operated under the programmatic and operational oversight of the DON until the end of the contract period of performance, September 30, 2010.  On October 1, 2010, the DON transitioned to the NMCI Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC), for the continued delivery of NMCI services to the DON, through April 30, 2014 (if all options are exercised).  The DON intends to transition IT services from CoSC to the follow-on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract(s). The primary goals of NGEN are to: 1) operate the NMCI network while maintaining delivery of NMCI network and computing services; 2) support the NMCI network and associated computing services from requirement identification to service disposal; 3) ensure continued security of the network and proactive enhancement of information assurance (IA) capabilities to meet evolving and emerging threats; 4) provide Government Command and Control (C2) to ensure flexible and responsive operation and defense of the network; 5) leverage DoD enterprise security services provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to meet user requirements as technically and fiscally feasible and approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA); and 6) maintain continuity of service during transition from NMCI CoSC to follow-on NGEN contract(s) or Government operation. The Government anticipates firm fixed price, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for the Transport and Enterprise Services requirements.  Award will be made to the offeror or combination of offerors that results in the lowest total combined price to the Government for the transition to, and operation and maintenance of the Next Generation Enterprise Network. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with four one-year options.  This is a full and open competition. With the exception of attachments J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J-43, this RFP has been released with all supporting attachments.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD<br>FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br><br>1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234<br><br>2. Description of Action:  Sole source acquisition for the purchase of training and consultation of Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) treatment modality therapy by the EMDR Institute.  Directed by Dr. Francine Shapiro, the creator and proprietor of the treatment modality. This action will be accomplished through the use of a Firm Fixed Price contract and will include five day training (30 students) at or near Army Installation (Washington, DC).  <br><br>3. Description of Products/Services: This contract will consist of training by direction of the creator and proprietor of EMDR treatment modality, Dr. Francine Shapiro. The trainer and two facilitators will provide guidance, education and knowledge in learning and application of EMDR with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder patients.  During EMDR the therapist works with the client to identify a specific problem, such as an intense combat situation where the individual witnessed significant injury or death to their fellow soldiers, the sound of an IED exploding, panic attacks, etc, that the client would like to be the focus of the treatment session.  EMDR is utilized by Behavioral Health and Mental Health Providers for soldiers who decline to or cannot verbalize trauma that they have experienced. <br><br>4. Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting from a single source.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).<br><br>5. Reason for Cited Authority: The Soldier and Family Support Branch (SFSB) of the  Department of Behavioral Health Sciences has requested that we bypass competition and enter into negotiations with EMDR Institute, Dr. Shapiro, is the leading expert in training professionals in the use of this therapeutic approach. Changing to another protocol would cause extensive re-training, re-certifications, consultation coordination per student and additional cost in travel/accommodations.   Dr. Shapiro is the sole proprietor and creator of EMDR, and is recognized throughout the field of psychology as the leading expert in the area of EMDR for the treatment of PTSD.  Dr. Shapiro has been used expansively worldwide by the Military and Veteran Administration (VA) systems as a consultant and trainer to the Behavioral Health and Mental health Provider within the DOD. <br><br>6.

<DESC>This notice is being posted in reference to a sole-source Task Order Number GS-P-01-12-BW-5150, issued under Contract Number GS-01P-07-BW-D-0063 for Commercial Facility Management Services at the Moakley United States Courthouse, Boston, Massachusetts, with EMCOR Government Services.<br /><br />The subject Task Order, issued on May 30th, 2012, was executed in response to an explosion and fire in the electrical switchgear room of the Moakley United States Courthouse that occurred on May 24th, 2012.<br /><br />This work was undertaken on an emergency basis in order to restore building electrical systems and fire /life safety equipment essential to the opening and continued operation of the Courthouse.<br /><br />Due to the nature of the emergency, an immediate response was required to prevent possible loss of life and additional damage to the asset itself.<br /><br />In accordance with approved Regional emergency procurement procedures, the Contractor was given the Notice to Proceed on May 25th, 2012, and a subsequent Task Order issued on May 30th, 2012, that incorporated the final definitization schedule.<br /><br />The referenced Delivery Order was based upon the contemporary assessment of the amount and nature of the needed emergency work, and with the intention of posting the required justification within 14 calendar days in accordance with FAR 6.305.<br /><br />However, in the interim, the technical assessment of the nature and extent of the damage changed, and additional potential issues have been identified that warrant further investigation in order to ensure that the risk of short-term recurrence is mitigated, and the Building's steady operational state is preserved.<br /><br />Due to these changes, the estimated amount of the contract has correspondingly increased, to the degree that additional review and approval thresholds, including the approval of the Regional Head of Contracting Activity, must now be satisfied.<br /><br />As these levels of review and approval were neither envisioned, nor triggered, by the original technical assessment of the conditions at the time of award, they cannot now be completed and satisfied within the posting time required by FAR 6.305.<br /><br />Therefore, GSA is issuing this notice to in order to communicate its intent to post the required justification as soon as the above reviews can be completed.
