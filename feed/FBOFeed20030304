<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for renewal of one year of Livelink annual software maintenance with two additional option years. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Open Text Corporation who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  Livelink is used in the Collaborative Engineering Center of NASA LaRC for projects assessment with over 400 licenses.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 14, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Levonson White 301-744-6687 Chris Gonzales 301-744-2591
<DESC>The Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIVNAVSURFWARCEN) has interest in proposals for designing, analyzing and manufacturing a coextrusion system to be used in highly solids filled polymer, 70-80 % solids fill, applications. The system will be used in Indian Head Division’s pilot scale propellant processing facility.  The system should be capable of combining melt flows from a Werner & Pfleiderer, W&P, 40-mm twin-screw extruder and from a W&P 37-mm twin-screw extruder positioned ninety degrees from each other.  The 40-mm TSE will be the extruder positioned in line with the coextrusion die.  The configuration of the coextrusion product will be an ABA type.  The A layers will come from the 37-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches and a thickness of about 0.015 inches.  The B layer will come from the 40-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches  and a thickness of about 0.080 inches.  The manufacturer should provide the transition piece that will feed the melt flows from the extruders to the coextrusion die.  Circulating water/propylene glycol mixture will provide temperature control for the coextrusion die.  The system should be capable of venting in the event that either or both extruders reach a pressure of 3,000 psi and should be designed such that no stagnation of material occurs inside the die.  The coextrusion system should also provide features to control flow, to adjust layer distributions and correct layer instabilities. It should also include die lip adjustment for overall thickness, edge trimming capability and a remote take away spooling system for product collection. The equipment shall comply with Hazardous Location Class I, Division 1, Group D and Class II, Division 1, Groups E, F and G requirements.   The proposal shall include: a three-dimensional flow model analysis for the coextrusion system.  The data required from the flow analysis would be pressure distributions, shear stress, shear rates and residence time in different regions of the die.  The manufacturer should also provide graphical data of temperature, pressure, shear rate and residence time distributions in the die along with volumetric flow rate of the die. Engineering procedures for assembling, disassembling, cleaning and operating the coextrusion system should also be included as well as system oversight during an inert coextrusion run.    The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center will provide, after contract award, the data required by the manufacturer for the flow analysis and three-dimension model  Offerors may submit a one-page abstract of their proposal.  Any offeror whose abstract is found t o be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal. Such an invitation does not assure subsequent contract award. Proposals may be reviewed and acted on as they arrive. The government reserves the right to select for award, all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Abstracts and proposals should include the following: (a) title page - include point of contact along with address, telephone and telefax number, e-mail address, and signature by an authorized officer.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center has a requirement and intends to negotiate a contract on an other than full and open competition basis for the provision of technical and engineering support of the goals and objectives of the National Protection Center  (NPS) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), SBCCOM-Natick Soldier Systems Center (SSC) cooperative technology programs.  The Government requires that analytical assistance services to DARPA and NPC bring advanced technologies to the atten tion of military and civilian user communities, support technical definitions of user requirements, provide observation and analysis of operational environments and requirements, and aid with the transitioning of technology for various applications.  All o f these requirements are in support of the DARPA and SBCCOM cooperative program for the development of lightweight advanced electronic components for soldier systems and in support of the NPC Pilot Program.  This Center intends to award a contract to Uncon ventional Concepts Incorporated (UCI), 4525 Ease Hollywood Boulevard, Suite A, Mary Esther, FL 32569.  Of particular interest are this company's unique knowledge, experience, and expertise in protective equipment and systems to aid not only war fighters, b ut also their civilian counterparts Emergency Responders (ERs) (e.g. law enforcement and corrections, firefighters, emergency medical service technicians) and other professionals operating in high-risk environments as well.  UCI possesses the qualified per sonnel and experience to implement the tasks required to achieve success in these highly visible programs.  Rapid and effective transition of these developed technologies is dependent upon the development of consensus and support between the user and opera tional community.  Close and frequent contact across a spectrum of user communities is necessary for the development of consensus among them.  UCI has demonstrated their ability to fulfill these requirements in their previous contract efforts for DARPA/SBC COM-NSC.  Also, UCI has proven their ability to provide real-time information and contacts related to technical and operational issues involved in order to best meet the requirements for effective evaluation and transition of advanced soldier system techno logies.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for a period of six (6) months for a base period and two, twelve (12) month option periods.  The effort is estimated to total approximately ten (10) to twenty-five (25) percent of one man -year, and the support shall include: technical review of advanced war fighter technologies and their operational environments, identification and assistance in technology transfer opportunities, evaluation/comparison of military-unique technologies to com mercial technologies, process engineering support in prototyping methodology and operations improvement, technical liaison support, and other related areas of support.  Security requirements, which require a security clearance at the appropriate level, are  included.   Any inquiries about this announcement should be directed to Ms. Michelle Miller via e-mail, Michelle.Miller@Natick.army.mil or by facsimile, 508-233-5286.  No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION FOR SYSTEM OFFICE FURNITURE UNDER NAICS CODE 337214 AND IS RESTRICTED 100% TO SMALL BUSINESSES.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, has a requirement for all design services, delivery and labor, equipment, devices and materials and performing all work required to install system office furniture, including incidental furnishings; i.e., standalone furnishings normally included in the cube design, such as chairs, files and tables.  A Fixed-Price/Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract is anticipated, with requirements to be fulfilled through the issuance of individual delivery orders.  Guaranteed minimum over the life of the contract is the amount of the first delivery order.  The anticipated ceiling price of contract is $4,500,000.  Performance will be at various buildings on Griffiss Park, Rome, NY.  Requirements include system office furniture for five (5) separate types of cubes layouts described in Bid Schedule.  In addition to submission of a proposal, Offerors will be required to set up a defined typical system office workstation for inspection by the source selection team.  Evaluation for award will be accomplished by comparing Offerors' capabilities and proposal elements against Government requirements.  This is a competitive source selection, which will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15 as supplemented.  The contract will be awarded to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment using the following defined criteria, to be the best value to the Government.  The Government will make an assessment based on the following evaluation criteria: FACTOR 1: QUALITY AND ABILITY TO MEET USER NEEDS/SPECIFICATIONS:  i) Subfactor 1: Ability to meet the specifications; ii) Subfactor 2: Visual quality and durability; iii) Subfactor 3: Cabling capability (lay-in is preferred to fish thru); iv) Subfactor 4: Accessibility (ease of panel removal/replacement).  FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE: The extent to which the Offeror's past performance met customer requirements, including the Offeror's history of forecasting and controlling costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally the Offeror's business-like concern for the interests of the customer.  In addition, the degree to which the Offeror complies with FAR 52.219-8, "Utilization of Small Business Concerns" will be evaluated based on performance under previous Government contracts containing this clause.  FACTOR 3: PRICE: The Government is more concerned with making an award based on these factors than at the lowest cost or price to the Government.  However, cost or price will still contribute substantially to the best value award decision.  The total scope of the technical tasks for which orders may be issued is set forth in the attached Statement of Scope.  All interested sources are responsible for frequent review of the website to ensure they are kept current on any applicable documents added after the initial RFP is issued.

Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.  If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction.  When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulations issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia.  The contractor must be able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language fluently.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) plans to negotiate and award a contract for the development of a probabilistic decision support tool for evaluation of technology insertion and assessing aviation system risk.  LaRC intends to negotiate with the Department of Industrial Engineering at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey on a sole source basis.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented at FAR Part 6.302-1.	Pursuant to 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), Rutgers University has submitted an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a unique capability to provide the research services, offers a concept and service not otherwise available to the Government and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive acquisition. Rutgers unique capability to perform the required research services is based upon its development of the Aviation System Risk Model (ASRM), the result of many years of research and development that was funded by both the FAA and NASA.  The ASRM includes a probabilistic, analytical approach used to model possible accident scenarios and to evaluate the impact that technology insertions may have on reducing the relative risk intensity level compared to a baseline period.  The work to be completed under the proposed contracting action builds upon the current capabilities of the ASRM system so that all products in the Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) portfolio can be analyzed and subsequently ranked according to their relative risk intensity.   Rutgers University is currently the only source known to possess all of the knowledge, experience and other capabilities necessary to complete the effort without a substantial duplication of costs to the Government and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling NASA's requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 19, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of work performed by AT&T under contract DCA200-97-D-0054 that was competitively awarded in February 1997.  This contract requires AT&T to provide network and hub operations for DISN Video Services (DVS).  A follow-on competition is in process and the anticipated award is in the fourth quarter of FY 2003.  This modification provides a continuation of support until implementation of the DVS II contract.  AT&T owns and operates all the equipment and proprietary software for the existing DISN Video Services under the DVS-G contract.  The Network Operations Center is located in an AT&T facility in Dranesville VA.  The government is unable to turn operations over to another vendor since they do not own any of the equipment.  AT&T is the only vendor to incorporate both dial-up and dedicated Video Teleconference Facilities (VTFs) and provide classified support at the level of security required in the time frame available.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of DVS-G services.  AT&T provides this secure service at a reliability of 99.6% on dedicated transmission links.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquiries regarding this synopsis shall be submitted electronically and directed to Lora T. Benhoff, Contract Negotiator, at benhof1l@scott.disa.mil.  Estimated date of award is 30 Apr 2003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA's), Joint Spectrum Center (JSC), is soliciting participation in the Emerging Spectrum Technology Program.  Emerging Spectrum Technology comprises those new technologies that use the electromagnetic spectrum to perform their functions or directly affect the manner in which the spectrum is accessed, used, occupied, or managed.  A wide range of emerging technologies offers the Department of Defense (DoD) opportunities to improve its utilization of scarce spectrum resources.  The goal of the program is to ensure that the Department of Defense has a strong technical foundation in the spectrum issues to support the implementation of emerging spectrum technologies. 

The proposed research should focus on the implications of inserting emerging spectrum technology solutions into the Department of Defense in place of, or in addition to, legacy systems.  The proposed research should address the following: (1) how will the operations of legacy systems impact the performance of systems incorporating emerging spectrum technologies, (2) how will the operations of emerging spectrum technology systems impact the performance of legacy systems, (3) what specific emerging spectrum technologies can best adapt to operational and electromagnetic environmental conditions and still meet operational requirements, (4) what are the primary transition issues to be resolved during the introduction of emerging spectrum technologies, (5) given that US and international frequency allocations can be substantially different, how can specific emerging spectrum technologies prevent regulatory issues from degrading operational performance, (6) to what extent are the effectiveness and efficiency of specific emerging technologies degraded by operations in a dense electromagnetic environment which can include jamming, and (7) how can emerging technologies promote sharing between radar and communications while not degrading performance.

This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i).  Interested organizations may submit a white paper for consideration.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  FACSIMILE AND TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED NOR CALLS RETURNED.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the white papers received in response to the announcement.   If a white paper is determined to be of interest, a proposal may be requested.  Principal funding for proposals selected from this announcement will begin in FY03.  A total of up to $500,000 for all awards is available with a duration of not more than twenty-four (24) months.  The Government may also issue contracts/agreements/grants/other transactions for any awards made under this announcement.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this BAA.

Large, small, women-owned small, veteran-owned small, small disadvantaged businesses, universities, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit white papers or join with others in submitting white papers; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for participation by any specific group due to impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Interested organizations shall submit three (3) copies of a 4-5-page white paper with a cover letter to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Anthony Carlisi, 5111 Leesburg Pike, Suite 900A, Falls Church, VA 22041.   The cover letter should identify the business type status of the organization, e.g., whether or not they are a university, an HBCU/MI, a not-for-profit business, a large, small, small disadvantaged, women-owned or veteran-owned business.  The white paper should be formatted in the following sections: Section A: Title, period of performance, cost of effort, and name of company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary.  The purpose of this white paper submission is to preclude unwarranted effort if the work identified is not of interest under this BAA.  Those respondents whose white papers are selected for further consideration will be requested to submit a one-page technical abstract for each task the Government has chosen to consider.  Based on the Government's evaluation of these abstracts, a technical and cost proposal may be requested. 

Complete instructions on proposal preparation and submission will be forwarded with any proposal invitation.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.  Evaluation of white papers/abstracts and proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The scientific and/or technical merits, (2) Contribution to the DISA Mission, (3) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) Relevance to achieving the technical goals of DoD, and (5) cost realism.  In addition, the Government may consider other factors, such as performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort.  No further evaluation criteria will be used.  The criteria used to evaluate the proposals will also be used to determine whether the white papers and abstracts submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  

Foreign or foreign-owned organizations are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign and foreign-owned organizations should immediately contact the focal point for information if they contemplate responding.   Any cost of preparing submissions in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Respondents must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) for proprietary protection of information.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered.  This announcement is open and effective until 30 April 2003.   Respondents are warned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  Respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number and reference number DISA/AQN3 - BAA - JSC with their submissions.   All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  The Department of Defense cannot award contracts to contractors that are not registered.  Information on CCR registration may be obtained by calling the CCR Registry at 1-888-227-2423 or be accessing the website at: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Dr. R.C. Wilhoit of College Station, Texas for the expansion and enhancement of the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) databases at NIST.  There will be a Base Year and One Option Year for this contract.  General skills involve computer programming, database design and management skills combined with extensive experience in chemical thermodynamics, thermophysics, chemistry and  chemical engineering.  Specialized skills include demonstrated familiarity with the TRC database systems, in particular, TRC SOURCE data system.  SOURCE data system is a major relational archival system developed and maintained by the TRC to store ?raw' experimental data for thermophysical, thermochemical and transport properties of pure compounds, binary and ternary systems as well as chemical reactions.  SOURCE data system is also a powerful tool to produce various compilations and critical evaluations of data in both hard-copy and electronic forms.  This work is targeting further enhancement of the database, in particular, its data entry and retrieval capabilities which should provide additional functions to automate thermophysical property data dynamic compilation concept.  Dr. Wilhoit is the original designer and developer of SOURCE database which is maintained and supported by the Thermodynamics Research Center of the Physical and Chemical Properties Division.  Dr. Wilhoit has also prepared a great variety of the batch data entry files which were successfully loaded into the SOURCE data system.  Progress in the development of SOURCE database has its immediate impact into development and timely completion of a variety of other databases as well as hard-copy data products scheduled for release by the TRC. Any lapse in the quality, continuity, and schedules for TRC data products would be severely detrimental to NIST and to the users of this information.  This notice is for information purposes only.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  No award will be made on the basis of requests in response to this notice.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http:\\oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date March 20, 2003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA This announcement is re-issued to correct the information provided concerning the changes to the performance specification.  The CT time was incorrectly identified in the announcement posted on 27 February 2003.  The correct CT time is listed below. As a r esult of previous synopses issued on 24 June 2002, 1 July 2002 and 19 December 2002, the government is in the process of purchasing commercially available protective masks, which will be tested against the government performance specification for the Joint  Service Chemical Environment Survivability Mask (JSCESM).  As a result of a recent change in the government’s acquisition strategy, the requirements for the JSCESM have been revised which will result in the procurement of a Block I JSCESM and a Block II J SCESM.  The government will test commercial available masks against the requirements of the Block 1 performance specification.  The changes to the performance specification, which has been posted on the following website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/ibo phome.nsf/home?open under RFP DAAD13-02-R-0031, are listed below: Vapor challenge levels identified for Block I and Block II (10,000 CT– Threshold and 32,500 CT– Objective)  Continuous above-the-neck head protection for six hours-Block II, two hours Block I Only Block II has a drink tube requirement Only Block II has FOV requirements Only Block II must permit use of receiving and transmitting communication devices Only Block II has immersion to 66 feet of saltwater Based on the results of these tests, the government may elect to limit competition for future procurements of the JSCESM.  Therefore, potential offerors should contact Ms. Carol Hillen @ (410) 436-2053 regarding the submission of potential candidate masks for testing.  Those firms that have previously submitted sample masks need not reply to this announcement.    A subsequent Presolicitation/Procurement announcement will be issued at a later date.

<RESPDATE>043003
<ARCHDATE>06292003
<CONTACT>Regina Blair, 312-353-6400, Ext. 1702
<DESC>NA The previous notice for DACW23-03-P-0001 is amended to make administrative changes. The question marks (?) appearing in various places throughout the notice have been changed or deleted, as appropriate. The question marks were inadvertently included as a r esult of information technology operational constraints. The revised notice is as follows:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Chicago District is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that currently possess the expertise, capabilities, an d experience necessary to meet the design criteria for the McCook Reservoir Mixing System.  THIS is a sources sought for planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost in curred for their participation in this survey.  Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey.  BACKGROUND: The reservoir will be operated as a facultative pond.  Mixing will only be used to resuspend the sediments at the bottom o f the reservoir, and the zone of mixing influence only needs to be approximately 10 feet deep.  The purpose of mixing the bottom 10 feet is to facilitate sediment removal when the reservoir is gravity drained via a bottom outlet.  Sediment will be resuspen ded and gravity drained while the reservoir is still full, throughout the entire range of water depths.  (The mixed layer will have 20 to 240 feet of water above it.)  EXPECTED water depth range = 30 feet to 250 feet.   THE MIXERS would be used to remove the sediments with the entire range of water depth still above the mixing zone.  Above the 10 feet mixing zone, it is desired that the water have very low (near zero) velocity so that mixing with the upper water column is  minimized.  A MIXING system for Stage 1 of the reservoir is the current focus.  Stage 1 is separated from Stage 2 and from the sump area by weirs that are approximately 150 feet high. A plan and profile of the McCook Reservoir is available by contacting Dr. Jennifer M iller at (312) 846-5502.   MAXIMUM depth of solids layer at bottom of reservoir = 36 inches of material with a water content of 99 percent. AVERAGE dry density of solids = 1.68 g/mL. BOTTOM slope of reservoir =  (a maximum of ) 1 percent toward the outlet. RESERVOIR will contain water approximately 10 percent of the time, and will be dry (and exposed to the elements) the remainder of the time. THE MIXER design could have a variable number of mixers for the variable water depth, but the overall design must address both low water and high water conditions.  PLEASE SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FOR THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SCENARIO: 1.	The number and layout of mixers or jets, including any auxillary pumps or other equipment, and including the space requirements of any equipment that would be located outside the reservoir. 2.	Technical data/description for the proposed equipment, including the horsepower rating. 3.	The total energy input that would be provided. 4.	A general description of the type of controls used for the system. 5.	A general description of the anchors or supports for the mixers or jets. 6.	Any special considerations or equipment that would be needed for the system to operate year-round, and for the equipment to withstand year-round exposure to weather conditions in an empty (completely dewatered) reservoir. 7.	Maintenance requirements for the equipment, including the equipment life, maintenance and replacement frequency, and replacement costs.  8.	An estimated cost for the system, broken down into construction cost and O&M costs, assuming a 20 year life for the system.  ALL CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS are due to Regina Blair and Dr. Jennifer Miller prior to the close of business on 30 April 2003, via email or fax.  The e-mail addresses for Ms. Blair and Dr. Miller are: regina.g.blair@lrc02.usace.army.mil, and J ennifer.miller@lrc02.usace.army.mil, respectively. FAX TO:  (312) 886-5475, ATTN: Regina Blair.

<SUBJECT>R -- Economic Policy Reform - Implentation of Policy Reform and Institutional Development  Republic of Montenegro
<DESC>The USAID Regional Contracting Officer in Budapest, Hungary intends to award a sole source contract to BearingPoint.  The contractor is currently providing technical assistance to the USAID/Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)/Montenegro in carrying out a broad range of complex economic reforms.  The reforms are designed to assist in Montenegro?s transition from a centralized, command oriented economy, to a market based economy.  BearingPoint has been instrumental in initiating a number of major reforms which are now in the critical process of implementation.  With USAID assistance provided through BearingPoint, a large amount of primary legislation was drafted and passed, and key institutional reforms were initiated, and to a large extent completed, from a policy and technical perspective.  The currently proposed follow-on focuses on implementation and institutionalization of these reforms. 

Key areas of involvement are:  tax and treasury reform, including implementation of five new tax laws, the restructuring of tax administration, and a complete tax IT system;  financial sector reform, focusing on bank supervision and problem bank resolution;  pension reform including reform of the policy framework and Fund administration;  assistance in drafting of a new Energy Law and assistance to the state power company;  assistance in drafting, and now the implementation of major business regulatory legislation;  and assistance in drafting and implementation of key anti-corruption legislation including anti-money laundering, anti-corrupt practices act, and best practices public procurement and concessions legislation.
  
BearingPoint has been instrumental in moving a number of key reforms forward in a range of areas.  These reforms are currently at a critical point in the implementation phase, particularly with regard to the strengthening of key institutions.  The BearingPoint advisors have been successful in developing effective relationships with counterparts and in providing capable assistance in order to achieve USAID/Montenegro?s reform objectives.  In order to ensure the successful implementation and institutionalization of these reforms, USAID/Montenegro requires the additional follow-on services of approximately 6,845 person days of US expatriate and 16,900 person days of third country and cooperating country nationals and associated costs over the next 21 months.

Under this proposed sole-source contract, BearingPoint will continue to provide technical assistance for the successful implementation of the reforms that have already been initiated.  Focus will be on: stabilizing revenues by institutionalizing reforms designed to broaden the tax base, shifting the tax regime from direct to indirect taxes, increasing  compliance, and completing the implementation of a nearly $1 million republic wide tax IT system; ensuring the smooth transition from the interim treasury system provided by USAID and the permanent system provided by the EU; institutionalizing the new Republic budget process during the critical months;  ensuring adequate bank supervision capability is in place prior to the establishment of deposit insurance; providing assistance to bank liquidators as three major bank problems are in the final stages of resolution and off-shore banks are being closed; completing the conversion to IAS and the separation of accounts at the electric power company in compliance with EU standards, an MOU signed with the Stability Pact, and the draft Energy Law; establishment of the new energy regulatory agency; and completion of training in major pieces of business regulatory legislation such as bankruptcy, secure transactions, concessions, and public procurement laws.

The proposed contract is to be sole sourced under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.  In accordance with Number Note 22 the following is provided:  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

 IV.  	POSITION DESCRIPTION:
 
 Introduction
 
 USAID-India recently completed its five year strategic plan for 2003-2007, which outlines its strategic objectives and priorities for the next five years. More information on USAID/India?s strategy can be received from the website                                                www.usaid.gov/india <http://www.usaid.gov/india>.  The goal of USAID India's Vulnerable People Strategic Objective (SO 5) is consonant with the Agency's Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance pillar and consistent with India's constitution that guarantees equality across gender, caste and religion, and promotes a rights-based, democratic framework.  Notwithstanding this impressive framework, large elements of the population are regularly denied their rights.  Social acceptability of this discrimination and abuse, combined with weak or non-enforcement of the democratic framework, limits opportunities for vulnerable populations, especially women and children. Creating and increasing access for the poor and marginalized to education and the country's judicial systems are critical to breaking the vicious cycle of abuse, discrimination and poverty, and realizing economic development.  Education is key to enabling the future workforce of men and women to embrace technological changes that can boost their productivity and earnings, and provide escape routes from poverty.  Education is also critically important in furthering democratic values such as tolerance and equality.
 
 India?s primary education sector faces considerable challenges to realize the "universal education" goals of enrolling all children in school by 2003 and increasing the literacy rate to 75% by 2007.  About half of the states and territories, as well as urban areas, were untouched by the educational reform process, resulting in a tremendous diversity in performance.  Performance gaps exist across and within states; between groups of children, with educational outcomes differing considerably between girls and boys; between the poor and the better-off; and between children of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other children. Studies in low-literacy districts in 8 states found that the gender gap in elementary-level achievement was exacerbated by the absence of female teachers, the absence of single-sex schools, the location of schools more than two kilometers from home, inadequate teaching/learning materials, and lack of separate toilets for girls. Parental attitudes discriminate against girls' education.
 
 Underscoring these challenges, India's Tenth Five-Year Plan concludes, ?Our performance in the field of education is one of the most disappointing aspects of our developmental strategy.?  The challenges of India?s basic education sector are broad and deep.  They include finding ways and means to address:
 
 Impacts of rapid urbanization; High drop-out rates as children are needed to earn income for family support; Large numbers of rural villages without reasonable access to schools; Stubbornly high rates of child illiteracy (56% of females and 31% of males age 6 and above) that threaten to continue the legacy of high rates of rural adult illiteracy; Inadequate school infrastructure; High rates of teacher absenteeism; Low competence, motivation, and performance among teachers; Outdated textbooks, syllabi, and curricula; and Weak or non-existent community linkages.
 
 Within USAID?s new SO 5, the two intermediate results which will work with the education sector are:  5.1., Improved Access to Education for Vulnerable Children and  5.3., New and Expanded Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups.  The target group for USAID?s education activities are envisioned to be: 1) out-of-school children in rural and urban areas, with a special focus on girls; 2) school administrators and policy makers in the education sector; and 3) teachers and teacher training facilities and local communities.  As the program grows, it is possible that these target groups will shift and/ or additional groups will be added.
 
 Under Washington-based field-support arrangements, in 1997 USAID/New Delhi initiated modest support in the basic education sector investing in development of gender-sensitized teachers? training module and establishment of a girl?s education resource center in the State of Uttar Pradesh.  Starting in 1999 USAID also provided grant assistance for umbrella arrangements with a U.S. PVO and UN agency with the aim of preventing and eliminating child labor through quality education activities.  The Mission is currently dialoguing with the GOI to define a potential role for USAID support to the GOI?s sponsored universal basic education program called ?Sharva Shikshan Abhayan? (SSA).  The Mission is also initiating a series of pre-implementation activities.  For example, it is promoting use if information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated education to enhance quality including radio interactive instructions.  Possible support to school water and sanitation program to boost girls? participation in schools is also contemplated.  Some discrete research on decentralization and school quality and a companion SSA initiative to engage Indian NGOs/foundations in promoting education in underserved districts and urban areas with high drop-out and rates are also planned for direct support arrangements. Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, discussions and negotiations with the GOI, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID?s newer substantive involvement in this sector.
 
 Duties and Responsibilities of the Position
 
 A USPSC Senior Education Advisor will serve as the senior technical and policy advisor, as well as Team Leader for the USAID/New Delhi Education Sector programs and projects to be designed and implemented under the recently approved new Mission five-year strategy.  USAID expects to support a combination of financing arrangements for these activities, e.g., bilateral grant with the GOI, direct umbrella arrangements, grants/cooperative agreements to international organizations and NGO?s, direct contacts, as well as to rely on global field support arrangements where relevant and practicable.
 
 The specific duties and responsibilities of the Senior Education Advisor will be: Technical and policy advisor to the Mission for the Education program As the Mission expert on education, advise USAID and other USG officials of trends and constraints (e.g., financing, political will and administrative capacity) and provide technical recommendations on opportunities that can promote the education sector agenda in India. Lead in planning/design, negotiation, management, monitoring and evaluation of education program activities (and any related technical/vocational training and higher education initiatives).  The scope of this advice includes issues related to qualify as well as access. Carry-out and support policy dialogue on issues such as financing and quality with GOI (central, state and municipal) officials and donors in consultation with Mission staff. Prepare technical and other reports and draft speeches, concept papers, position papers, talking points and briefs for the Mission Director, other senior USAID officials and the Ambassador on education sector issues. Draft or oversee the drafting of project scopes of work and program descriptions to compete and award acquisition and/or assistance instruments to implement technical programs in the areas highlighted above.
 
 Program Management and Oversight
 
 Provide leadership to a multidisciplinary team as well as to partner implementing organizations in achieving Strategic 5, IR 1 to ensure that planned development results are achieved in a highly efficient, timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies.

Review and supervise preparation of requisite USAID documents, e.g., semi-annual and annual program performance reports. Provide substantive input in establishing performance monitoring systems for results frameworks. Perform or supervise the conduct of program evaluations and assessments.

ii)	Develop, nurture and sustain close collaborative, professional relationships with senior (secretary-level) GOI central, state and municipal level officials, other mainline donors like the World Bank and the European Community, corporate philanthropic foundations (in the US and in India), international organizations and leading education research institutions.

DESCRIPTION:  Fire Prevention Education Team Coordinator, Performance Based Statement of Work 
Background 
The National Fire Prevention and Education Team (NFPET) program has been serving on an interagency basis throughout the United States since 1996.  NFPETs are typically mobilized and deployed to locales, which are experiencing higher than normal wildfire danger or a high incidence of human caused wildfires.  Their primary role is to supplement and support the wildfire prevention efforts of local personnel and agencies.  They have proven to be highly successful at reducing the occurrence of unwanted human caused wildfires, through the use of trained specialists and state-of-the-art communication and education techniques.  Prior to the 2002 wildfire season, NFPETs had been requested by federal and state agencies in 20 states.  Numerous additional requests were received during 2002.

From 1996 through the 2002 wildfire season, the training, equipping and mobilization of NFPETs was conducted on an ad hoc basis.  Although widely recognized as a successful entity, and provided for in recent editions of the National Mobilization Plan, NFPETs and team members often had to overcome mobilization, logistical, financial, organizational and demobilization challenges in order to successfully accomplish an assignment.

In 2001, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's (NWCG) Wildland Fire Education Working Team (WFEWT) expressed an interest in sponsoring the NFPET program and assembled a task force to develop a three-year strategy which would to lead to the program being recognized and managed as a true national, interagency resource.  The resulting ?National Fire Prevention and Education Teams Three Year Strategy? provided mission and vision statements, outlined focus areas, and presented strategies and tasks necessary for this concept to proceed.  Members of the task force included subject-matter experts from the Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

In January 2002, the WFEWT reviewed and approved the three-year strategy and presented it to the NWCG.  The NWCG subsequently accepted the concepts embodied in the strategy and approved an annual budget allocation for three years.
