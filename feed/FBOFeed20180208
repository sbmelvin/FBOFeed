This version includes titanium components that provides a weight savings of &frac12; lb. over the current steel adjustable bipod design.
<p>Any offeror awarded a contract resulting from the formal solicitation shall be required to conduct First Article Test (s) (FAT) and a Lot Acceptance Test(s) (LAT). The FAT and LAT requirements will be outlined and included in the draft solicitation. Should a resulting contract be awarded, the First Article sample shall be submitted to the Government 240 days After Contract Award (ACA) and monthly production deliveries shall commence 75 days after contractor receipt of written U.S. Government approval of the First Article Sample with 100 Lightweight Adjustable Bipod Assemblies to be manufactured the first month, followed by a quantity of 200 Bipod Assemblies the following two months and ramping up to a rate of 250 Bipod Assemblies per month for the subsequent months for the remaining balance of the contract. Delivery schedules for future orders will be established at the time of award.</p>
<p>The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M240 Lightweight Adjustable Bipod is marked with a "Distribution D" and "Distribution B" restrictive markings which limits distribution to Department of Defense and U.S. DoD Contractors. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751,et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all Subcontractors at every level. The manufacture of the M240 Lightweight Adjustable Bipod is restricted to within the United States and its Territories.</p>
<p>The offeror shall not reproduce, duplicate or copy the TDP, or any portion thereof, except to the extent necessary for, and then only in connection with (i) the preparation and/or submission of proposals related to this procurement being affected by the United States Government, or (ii) the manufacture within the United States by the United States or under a contract with the United States Government.

The CDT VPL will increase the effectiveness of driver training by permitting the instructor to observe student driver performance and their reactions to artificially induced malfunctions and (tactical) emergency conditions. The contractor will be responsible for producing CDT VPL based off the current CDT Component and developing and updating the CDT Component Architecture as necessary. The contractor will be responsible for restructuring CDT software and hardware, as necessary, to improve the CDT product line and leverage the LT2 portal and LT2 IDE. The contractor will be responsible for integrating CDT IDE and SSE into LT2 IDE.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services (CGS) Region 1 has been tasked to solicit for and procure a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to design and build an approximately 400-square-foot interpretive area that includes informal seating and incorporates interpretive panels into the design with the intent of introducing visitors to the concepts of appropriate and sustainable use, natural resource protection, and species conservation. The project site is located at the south end of Sea Coast Drive in Imperial Beach, California on the Tijuana Slough NWR and is subject to significant use by walkers and cyclists. Project is a small business set-aside.  Applicable NAICS code is 541430.  Small business size is defined as $7.5 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  The period of performance is from award to September 30, 2019. A site visit date/time will be identified in the solicitation package to be issued, along with a cut of date for submission of questions.  

The following is the current Statement of Work of the required tasks. 

1.  General:

1.1 General Project Description - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), San Diego National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex, P.O. Box 2358, Chula Vista, CA 91912, proposes to design and build an approximately 400-square-foot interpretive area that includes informal seating and incorporates interpretive panels into the design with the intent of introducing visitors to the concepts of appropriate and sustainable use, natural resource protection, and species conservation. The project site is located at the south end of Sea Coast Drive in Imperial Beach, California on the Tijuana Slough NWR and is subject to significant use by walkers and cyclists. 
1.2 Purpose - The Refuge intends to develop and deliver information to the public in an informal setting about the Refuge and the natural resource partnerships that make up the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve. The overall design theme for the approximately 400-square-foot interpretive area should reflect the character of the adjacent natural setting, which consists of coastal salt marsh and sandy beach habitats. The Refuge envisions informal seating that is integrated into a small gathering spot with associated interpretive panels. The messages conveyed by the interpretive panels would include an introduction to the Tijuana Estuary (its resources and management), and themes that will expand the publics understanding of the protected habitats and species of the Tijuana River watershed, along with the effects that water quality has on the Tijuana Estuary, adjacent Pacific Ocean, and associated public uses. Another purpose of the interpretation is to increase the publics understanding of the need to protect from disturbance the endangered and threatened species that rely on the estuarys habitats, and in turn result in greater compliance by the public in respecting permanent and seasonal closures of portions of the estuary and beach.
1.3 Contractor Qualifications - The Contractor must demonstrate expertise in designing and building outdoor interpretive areas that are creatively designed to reflect the setting in which they are located, while also providing resiliency to the physical, climatic, and social challenges inherent in a beach setting. Further, the Contractor must demonstrate expertise in developing informative interpretive messaging for interpretive panels using creative designs both in term of sign layout and overall panel design, and fabricating and installing the panel in a manner that is integrated into the overall site design. Contractor must be capable of providing sign text in English and Spanish. Two examples of past completed work involving the integration of interpretative panels into an informal gathering area, along with two examples of interpretive writing, interpretive messaging, and interpretive signage shall be included with the bid. 
1.4 Other - This project is being implemented under the authority of the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, 16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., as amended. All elements of the project shall be designed to comply with the Federal Guidelines for Outdoor Developed Areas (36 CFR Part 1191) of the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA).
2.  Place of Performance and Period of Performance:
  
2.1 Place of Performance - The design work to be performed will take place at the contractors office, while construction and sign installation will occur at the project site. In addition, one pre-construction site visit will be required. The project site is located on the Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge at the southern terminus of Sea Coast Drive within the City of Imperial Beach, San Diego County, California. Note that this site is located within a coastal barrier dune habitat; therefore, the project site is subject to occasional shifting sands and water inundation. Meetings with Refuge staff will occur at the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex headquarters, located at 1080 Gunpowder Point Drive, Chula Vista, CA  91910. 

2.2 Period of Performance - The Performance start date shall be no later than one month after the award of contract and the end date is September 30, 2019.

2.3 Work Hours - Contractor should be available during normal business hours (Monday through Friday 8:00 am  4:30 pm). In the event of emergencies, Contractor shall provide contact information.

2.4 Non-duty Hours - Non-duty hours include week nights, weekends, and Government holidays (New Years Day, Memorial Day, Presidents Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Columbus Day, Christmas).

3.  Scope   

The Contractor shall provide all services necessary for the design and construction of the interpretive area (including informal seating, the integration of three interpretive panels, completion of the required construction/site plan, and construction in accordance with the approved site plan/design), as well as the development, design, fabrication, delivery, and installation of the three interpretive panels; including all labor, materials, facilities, and travel necessary to:

Design and Build the Interpretive Area
The contractor shall work with Refuge staff to develop a construction/site plan for a 400-square-foot interpretive area that creates an open welcoming space with informal seating where visitors can stop and take time to read the interpretative panels that have been incorporated into the space. This informal interpretive area shall be creatively designed to reflect the setting in which it is located, while also providing resiliency to the physical, climatic, and social challenges inherent in a beach setting. The design shall incorporate repurposed material partly collected from the Tijuana River Valley. The seating area(s) and interpretive panels shall be integrated into the installations overall artistic design. 

The final plan shall specify all the materials to be used, illustrate how the interpretive panels will be integrated into the design, and demonstrate how conformance with the Federal Guidelines for Outdoor Developed Areas will be achieved. 

Upon approval of the construction plans, the contractor shall construct all aspects of the interpretive area and install the interpretive panels per the approved construction/site plan.

Develop Interpretive Messages for the Panels
The Contractor shall work with Refuge staff to develop the interpretive messages that will be incorporated into the overall design of the three (3) interpretive panels. The messages are intended convey to the public how the lands within the Tijuana Slough NWR contribute to the conservation of native habitats and an array of sensitive and listed species, and will incorporate the following themes:  

-	Informing the public that they are on protected lands that are part of the National Wildlife Refuge System;
-	Expanding the publics understanding of the purpose of this National Wildlife Refuge and the partnerships that contribute to the National Estuarine Research Reserve;
-	Interpreting coastal wetland habitats and the resident and migratory wildlife species that comprise and rely upon them; 
-	Educating the public about the water quality issues affecting the Tijuana Watershed and Pacific Ocean; and
-	Interpreting the causes of species endangerment and demonstrating how we can all contribute to species recovery using real world examples for species present on the Refuge. 

Design, Fabricate, and Install Interpretive Panels
The Contractor shall work with Refuge staff to design, fabricate, and install three interpretive panels for integration into the interpretive area. Once the designs are approved, the Contractor shall fabricate and install the panels. Depending upon the final design, it may also be necessary to design, fabricate, and install accompanying interpretive sign bases and/or mounts at the interpretive area. Specifically, this task involves: concept design through installation of three (3) interpretive panels a minimum size of 2 feet by 4 feet (to communicate interpretive conservation related messages as agreed upon with Refuge staff) and all associated mounting structure/base. The text on all interpretive signs shall effectively and efficiently communicate in both English and Spanish the primary interpretive messages developed for the project site.
 
General Contractor Requirements

Budget: The Contractor is responsible for completing all tasks within a fixed budget (including all design and construction of the interpretive area and design, fabrication and installation of the interpretive signs and associated mountings). The Contractor shall provide all materials, equipment, supplies, labor, and professional expertise required to accomplish the tasks within the Scope of Work and provide the deliverables described within.  

Interpretive Area and Exhibit Considerations: All structures, seating area(s), ground surfaces, and interpretive panels shall comply with the Final Guidelines for Outdoor Developed Areas (36 CFR Part 1191) and shall be designed to withstand constant touching, visitor interaction, as well as the physical challenges inherent in a beach setting.  Materials used for the interpretive panels shall include a 10 year warranty against fading, cracking, delaminating or peeling, and shall be impervious to weather, graffiti and vandal resistant, and easy to clean. Material used in the construction of the interpretive area, including informal seating, shall to the extent practicable have reduced risk of damage from exposure to sunlight and atmospheric elements or vandalism or misuse.  

Consultation and Coordination with Fish and Wildlife Service (Refuge) Staff: Close coordination with Refuge staff involved with the project will be required throughout the design/build process, including gathering initial input from Refuge staff prior to developing a site design for the interpretative area, identifying interpretive messaging, and designing the interpretive panels. The Contractor is required to obtain written or email approvals for initial concepts before proceeding to next steps.  

Photographs and Illustrations: Refuge staff can provide images of Refuge-specific wildlife and scenic high resolution digital photographs. If other photos or illustrations are proposed for use, the artwork/illustrations shall be both aesthetically pleasing and biologically accurate, samples of any illustrations to be created by an illustrator must be submitted for approval prior to initiating any agreements with the illustrator, and the Contractor shall submit appropriate releases from the artist/photographer for each photo/illustration to be used on the panels. 

Interpretive Writing: Prior to the initial meeting with Refuge staff, Contractor shall submit samples of interpretive writing in both English and Spanish from the writer who will be responsible for developing the text for the interpretive panels. 

Care and Maintenance: Contractor shall provide written and electronic information regarding interpretive panel care and maintenance.

4.  Additive Bid Items

-	a. Additional Interpretive Panels - Design, fabricate, and install two (2) additional interpretive panels and any associated mounting structures (for a total of five (5) interpretive panels and required mounting) for integration into the interpretive area. 

b. Incorporate the Interpretive Area into an Adjacent Decking Structure  Rather than construction the interpretive area on the 400-square-foot sandy area adjacent to an existing overlook deck, incorporate the interpretive area into the deck structure, which would likely require some rehabilitation of the existing decking or construction of additional decking to provide a base for the newly constructed interpretive elements and informal seating area.

c. Additional Interpretive Enhancements  Purchase, incorporate into the overall design, and install one (1) public viewing optical telescope mount with two (2) telescopes installed on it at varying heights to enable public viewing of birds and natural features present within the estuary. The design and installation of the telescope mount and telescopes shall be able to withstand constant touching, visitor interaction, as well as the physical challenges inherent in a beach setting.  Materials shall be impervious to weather, graffiti and vandal resistant, and easy to clean. The inclusion of brass fixtures shall be avoided due to the potential for theft.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters has released a solicitation, titled Early Career Faculty (ECF), as an appendix to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2018 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2018), on February 7, 2018. The solicitation is available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ , selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting "Early Career Faculty (ECF)."<br /><br />
<p>STMD, and the Space Technology Research Grants (STRG) Program in particular, seek proposals from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. NASA is seeking proposals that plan to pursue innovative, early-stage space technology research in the topic areas specifically enumerated in the solicitation.<br /> <br />Our Nation's universities couple fundamental research with education, encouraging a culture of innovation based on the discovery of knowledge. Universities are, therefore, ideally positioned to both conduct fundamental space technology research and diffuse newly-found knowledge into society at large through graduate students and industrial, government, and other partnerships. STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. universities promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country's scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. These investments also create, fortify, and nurture the talent base of highly skilled engineers, scientists, and technologists to improve America's technological and economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>The following topics are anticipated for the final appendix: Batteries for Extreme Cold Environments; MOF and Ionic Liquids/Membrane Technologies for Advanced CO2 Removal Applications; Entry Guidance Methods for Precision Planetary Landers.</p>
<p>Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. The proposed research must be led by a single, eligible Principal Investigator (PI). The PI must be an untenured Assistant Professor on the tenure track at the sponsoring U.S. university at the time of award. The PI must be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status of permanent residency. The PI must be the primary researcher on the effort; Co-Investigators are not permitted. Collaborators (other than NASA civil servants/JPL) are permitted. See the solicitation (Section 3.0) for complete requirements regarding eligibility and for definitions and restrictions regarding collaborators.<br /> <br />A PI may submit only one proposal in response to this appendix.</p>
<p>NASA encourages submission of ECF proposals on behalf of early career faculty members at all U.S. universities and especially encourages women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities.<br /> <br />The financial and programmatic support for ECF comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate. Awards are planned to start in October 2018. NASA plans to make approximately 6-8 awards as a result of this ECF solicitation, subject to the receipt of meritorious proposals and the availability of funds.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Room 1E646, Rockville, MD 20850-9700.
<p>Note: This synopsis follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on March 8, 2017 under HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-PCPSB-75006-45. THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), NCI, has a long-standing pharmaceutical agent development program administered through the Chemopreventive Agent Development and Research Group (CADRG) as a Repository services unit. The object of the Repository program is to establish a centralized source of agents for use in studies by the DCP and to support the translation of promising laboratory discoveries into effective interventions for the prevention or reduction of cancer. The Repository services are integral to most of the scientific and clinical work undertaken by the Division.</p>
<p>This procurement is to continue a well-established Repository program within the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The successful Contractor shall maintain a centralized source of agents and development services necessary to support chemoprevention studies for effective medical interventions in the prevention or reduction of cancer. The repository provides important logistic organization for the acquisition, tracking, storage, maintenance, testing, quality control, and distribution of investigational agents.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, all work shall be in conformance with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) established current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/cder/ucm095412.htm), and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) standards (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=58 ). If there are subcontracted activities needed during the development of an investigational agent, the Contractor shall audit, implement, coordinate and monitor the flow of subcontracted work so that it proceeds in the most efficient and timely manner possible.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201100046C held by MRIGlobal.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />The purpose of the acquisition is to provide services to support many different agent development functions critical to chemoprevention research. These functions are generally described as sourcing, acquiring, documenting, storing, quality testing, custom manufacturing, packaging and labeling, distributing and tracking both pre-clinical investigational agents for basic research and clinical supplies for human clinical trials.</p>
<p>1) The Core Competencies required include cost estimation, agent receiving, specification setting, analytical testing, material acceptance and release, packaging and labeling, stability testing, proper environmental storage, shipping domestically and abroad, inventory tracking of clinical trial materials, agent returns and destruction or disposal of investigational agents and clinical study supplies. All information to support regulatory filings to health authorities, scientific reports for research documentation and manuscript publication will be maintained by the contractor and provided to DCP, when requested.<br />If the contract requires specialty services for the timely development of agents identified through DCP programs (e.g., the DCP RAPID program), a well-organized and effective subcontracting administrative unit may be needed if the Offeror is unable to self-perform the required work.</p>
<p>2) An offeror's facility must have sufficient space for: storage of pre-clinical agents (estimated at 5,000 sq. ft. of useable space); storage of clinical study supplies (estimated at 5,000 sq. ft. of useable space); a staging/quarantine area; separate shipping and receiving rooms; and, space devoted to an analytical chemistry unit (estimated at 5,000 sq. ft.) with a detached weighing area. The space must include areas for refrigerated and other environmentally-controlled storage conditions (e.g., light protection, humidity controlled cabinets - approximately 500 sq. ft.).</p>
<p>3) A comprehensive and continuously updated computerized logistics management system containing inventory movements, quantities on hand, expiration or re-test information, Certificates of Analysis and analytical testing results, on all materials, must be made available electronically to the National Cancer Institute Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) on demand through a secure, password-protected, DCP-dedicated server.</p>
<p>4) The successful Awardee shall be required to demonstrate experience and competency in domestic and international shipping of pharmaceuticals, especially through U.S. and foreign Customs, the FDA, and other Health Authorities in accordance with applicable regulations. The successful Awardee must have experience in obtaining a Quality Persons Determination for agents shipped into the European Union.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement will be for non-R&amp;D support services which will include severable and non-severable services. The severable services will include inventory management which includes receipt, processing, and distribution of research materials and agents. The non-severable services will include manufacturing vaccines not commercially available for use in pre-clinical and clinical trials.</p>
<p>This acquisition shall be acquired through full and open competitive procedures, and will be processed under FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) and the business size standard is $15,000,000.</p>
<p>The NCI anticipates awarding a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to the Offeror capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the Base Statement of Work (SOW.). Only one (1) award will be made as a result of the Solicitation with a 60 months base period of performance beginning on July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />The place of performance will be the Contractor's work site.</p>
<p>Set Aside Status:<br />None.</p>

Description:  The purpose of this project is to rehabilitate the historic Trading Post, also known as Kozlowskis Trading Post, to provide for adaptive reuse of the existing building for visitor contact, interpretation, and offices for park staff. The Trading Post consists of approximately 5,098 gross square feet (building footprint) and approximately 3,818 square feet of net usable area. About 70 percent of the building will be rehabilitated for visitor use, consisting of a visitor contact area, interpretation and/or display areas and public restrooms. The remaining 30 percent will be rehabilitated for office space for park staff. The existing space must accommodate all equipment, such as HVAC, electrical, etc. No additions to the existing building are proposed. The exterior of the building and site will provide setting and features consistent with the significance of the property and the parks interpretive goals for enhancing the overall visitor experience of the Trading Post.

This building is an example of a typical Northern New Mexico vernacular adobe building. It is a low (one story), sprawling, U-shaped building, which began as a 600 square foot, one-room structure and grew through a series of additions to approximately 5,000 square feet. The building is listed on the NPS List of Classified Structures (LCS), and has been Determined Eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, with a national significance.

Location
The project is located within Pecos National Historical Park in San Miguel County, New Mexico, approximately 30 miles east of Santa Fe via automobile.

In addition, the building will be treated to eliminate or control pests such as termites, beetles, and rodents. The building will be brought into compliance with health and life safety, building code and other regulatory requirements, as appropriate. The estimated price range for the work described herein is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

The Trading Post is an historic building of national significance. Therefore, the work will emphasize compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.

It is the Governments intent to utilize the contract resulting from this solicitation to accomplish Basewide  
Custodial Services. The resulting contract will be a combination firm-fixed price (FFP) and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract. Work will be performed at the Naval Support Activity (NSA Crane), Crane, Indiana and the Glendora Test Facility at Sullivan Indiana. It is the intention of this solicitation to provide all labor, equipment, tools, supplies, environmental controls, transportation, supervision, quality control, and management necessary to perform custodial services basewide. Note: Multiple buildings at NSA Crane require custodial service and are scattered throughout the base.
  The Glendora Test Facility is located approximately 60 miles northwest of NSA Crane.  

The proposed solicitation will contain provisions for a 12-month base period plus four 12-month option periods, to be exercised at the Governments discretion.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under the Option to Extend Services clause.

The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561720 Janitorial Services. The Small business Size Standard is $18.0 million. 

Low Price-Technically Acceptable selection procedures will be utilized in conducting this competitive negotiation, which will consist of the submission of price and technical proposals.

This contract will replace a contract for similar services awarded in 2013 for $5,814,076.56 (firm-fixed price portion) and $196,664.38 (indefinite quantity estimate/maximum value per year).  Information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.  Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for this information.

A sources sought notice (N4008518R1614) for this procurement was posted on 20 December 2017 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
  As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to issue this solicitation as a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic small business office concurs with this decision.

Approximate release date is 23 February 2018 with proposals due no earlier than 30 calendar days after the actual release date.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement to lease a floating shock test platform (FSP) and ancillary lifting equipment, delivery, and incidental services for operations at Lake Glendora, Sullivan, IN 47882. The proposed contract action is for the supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Hi-Test Laboratories in Arvonia, VA in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This is being sole sourced because Hi-Test Laboratories is the only facility capable of fabricating and leasing the floating shock test platform to the US Government in the required time-frame.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under the Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) to the following contractor for Fire Alarm System Maintenance Services in support of Iowa City VA Health Care System, 601 Highway 6 West, Iowa City, IA 52246-2209:

Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP
DUNS: 094738007
4700 Exchange Court, Suite 300
Boca Raton, FL 33431-4450

This is done under authority of 41 U.S.C. 152 (3) and 40 U.S.C. 501, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B): Only one source is capable of providing the supplies and services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

This is not a request for competitive quotes.

Market research revealed that Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP is the proprietary developer and sole service provider for the fire alarm system currently being utilized by Iowa City VA Health Care System.
 
Additionally, Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP is the creator and Original Equipment Manufacturer of the fire alarm equipment (4100ES Networked Fire Alarm System) and has over the life of this equipment serviced this equipment for Iowa City VA Health Care System. Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP, furthermore, owns the proprietary maintenance rights for this equipment. Thus, it is impossible for any other company to provide maintenance for this equipment as Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP has sole rights and does not allow for authorized resellers, authorized dealers, or third party maintenance vendors to provide such services. Any other entity besides Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP providing this service would result in violation of these proprietary rights and voiding of any equipment warranties, as applicable.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this service is 561621 (Security Systems Services) and the Product Service Code (PSC) is H963 (Other Quality Control/Test/Inspect   Alarm, Signal, and Security Detection Systems).

While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement, including documentation from the proprietary rights holder Johnson Controls Fire Protection LP that such contractor could provide this service as an authorized reseller, authorized dealer or third party. 

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency by e-mailing such statement and supporting documentation to Doug Reed, Contracting Officer, at douglas.reed3@va.gov. No phone calls please. Please indicate  Response to LSJ Fire Alarm System Maintenance  in subject line of e-mail.

Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice: 
In reference to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.204 "Pre-solicitation Notices", the following information in provided regarding a planned Request for Quotation (RFQ #140G0318Q0034) for a project involving the drilling and installation of a groundwater monitoring well in the relatively remote area of Pigeon Canyon in Northern Arizona.

Project Description:
The Arizona Water Science Center in Tucson, AZ is in need of a contractor experienced with the installation of groundwater monitoring wells in consolidated deposits in Northern Arizona.  A single perched groundwater monitoring well is needed as part of a groundwater water-quality study which will monitor possible contributions from the former Pigeon uranium mine to elevated uranium concentrations at Pigeon Spring.  The monitoring well will 1) monitor water levels in the well to obtain local information on the direction of perched groundwater flow; and,  2) monitor water quality in the well to compare with water chemistry at Pigeon Spring.  The depth of the well is expected to be about 550 feet.

Magnitude of Construction: The estimated magnitude of construction project is between $25,000 and $100,000.

Location of Work:  The monitoring well shall be drilled at location 3643.87548' North latitude and 11229.20338' West longitude (NAD83 datum; fig. 2).  This location is approximately 7 miles down unpaved roads after turning off Forest Service Road 22 at White Sage Flat.  (This turnoff is approximately 15-20 miles southeast of Fredonia, AZ)

Tentative dates for issuing the solicitation, proposal due date, and completing contract performance: The Government anticipates releasing the Request for Quotations on or about 2/23/2018 with a proposal due date of 3/20/2018.  The anticipated date for contract performance is flexible, to be coordinated and mutually agreed after contract award, so long as the project is completed by 9/30/2018.  The full solicitation will be available electronically, free of charge, on fbo.gov under Solicitation Number 140G0318Q0034.

This requirement will be set aside for small businesses under NAICS 237110. The Government reserves the right to further restrict competition for other small business concerns, i.e. HUBZone, SDVOSB, at the time of solicitation release.

**Interested parties may send an email to dshannon@usgs.gov with the subject: 140P6218R0011 - Drilling Pigeon Canyon Monitoring Well**

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin, Marietta, GA. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Government's requirements to develop Mission Computer Operational Flight Program software updates for the AC/MC-130J Special Operations Forces (SOF) aircraft and perform SOF C-130J integration services from multiple Third Party Mission Systems sources. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1.<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement action will be for the issuance of a new Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract award based on other than full and open competition to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LMA) Company, Cage Code 98897. The IDIQ contract will provide for Operational Flight Program (OFP) block upgrades on SOF C-130 Fixed Wing Aircraft and systems engineering &amp; integration support activities encompassing multiple Third Party Mission Systems sources. The required tasks for these services are to provide technical expertise and capabilities for the PEO-FW AC/MC Integration lead. Aircraft mission computer OFP block upgrades are required to address SOF C-130J flight test deficiency reports (DR) and delivery of future builds enabling the integration of currently programmed SOF modifications including Special Mission Systems, Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM), MC-130J Common Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance Radar (MCTF), Integrated Tactical Mission Systems (ITMS), Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), and multiple tanker modifications. <br /><br />A sources sought synopsis (SSS) was publicized as required by DFARS 206.302-1(d) on 11 January, 2018. There was one response to the H92222-18-R-0003 posting. An analysis was performed on the white paper submitted by the one respondent. Based on an engineering analysis, this respondent has been deemed non-capable of supporting this requirement due to lack of access to the required proprietary data necessary for this effort. After evaluation of the response received to the sources sought issued 11 Jan. 2018 USSOCOM has determined that no other supplier can provide the requested services. <br />All software must undergo full qualification testing in a System Integration Lab (SIL) to include regression and flight testing on an SOF configured AC/MC-130J. The required aircraft level integration must include systems engineering, systems architecture, and publications management. Additionally, the ability to perform specific SOF C-130J engineering analyses, field level engineering and technical support. Companies must have access, and the ability to perform work in a facility and with personnel cleared at the Secret classification level, at minimum.
<p>The Government anticipates awarding one contract related to this announcement for a period of approximately three years with a potential maximum of up to $18, 0000,000.00. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency, see Note 22. Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mrs. Sonia Hammons, Contracting Officer, Phone (813) 826-7347. <br />This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by USSOCOM to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. USSOCOM is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.</p>

Based on the responses to this Sources Sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. Multiple awards may be made. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM/SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS:</p>
<p>1. M4A1 SLAM is a multipurpose, one-shot, anti-materiel/demolition device, compact, lightweight munition with anti-disturbance and self-destruct features. The M4A1 SLAM operates in four (4) different modes: Bottom Attack (Magnetic), Side-Attack (Passive Infrared), Time Demolition, and Command Detonation (Blasting Cap). The M4A1 SLAM is designed to be readily portable and hand emplaced against lightly armored infantry vehicles, parked aircraft, wheeled or tracked support vehicles, and ammunition or Petroleum, Oil and Lubrication (POL) storage sites. The M4A1 SLAM includes magnetic and Passive Infrared sensors, munition controls, electronic packaging, and an EFP (Explosively Formed Penetrator) warhead. Initial deliveries are anticipated to begin approximately 18 months after award, with an initial buy of approximately 3,000 SLAMs, requiring at minimum, fabrication, validation and testing the Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA), Safe and Arming (S&amp;A) Assemblies, Type 10 Warhead Assemblies, Type 9 Base and Cover (B&amp;C) Assemblies, and M4A1 SLAM Assembly to meet all Technical Data Package (TDP) requirements.</p>
<p>2. The M320A1 SLAM Improved Functional Trainer (SIFT) is a compact, lightweight interactive trainer with an anti-disturbance feature. The M320A1 SIFT replicates the same size and shape as the SLAM M4A1. This M320A1 SIFT is totally inert and is powered to provide feedback to the user and trainees through the use of two Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights and a buzzer. The LED light conditions whether flashing or color, or internal buzzer, indicate current M320A1 SLAM status, errors or detonation. The device has the same sensor and timing functionality as the tactical M4A1 SLAM. The controls, functions, and external interfaces of the SIFT trainer are identical to the M4A1 SLAM except for the warhead and explosive firing train. At this time quantities are unknown.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>It is anticipated that any resultant contract would address five (5) years of Government requirements. A respondent to this survey should demonstrate adequate technical and manufacturing capability along with successful experience in the explosives processing industry. A respondent to this market survey must currently exhibit or be able to obtain the skills and facilities required to manufacture and supply these items.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>The Government requires the manufacture, inspection, testing, and delivery of these items/systems in accordance with the Government owned Technical Data Package (TDP) and Product Specifications/Descriptions as applicable. Capabilities must include experience and facilities for development, laboratory and field-testing, including infrared and magnetic signature testing, and fabrication of the electronic and mechanical assemblies similar to the M4A1 SLAM. Potential prime contractor must show the capability and past experience working with sensor technology, electronic circuitry, crystals, and fuzing technology similar to the M4A1 SLAM. The offeror must have facilities to store the High Explosive (HE) and Ammunition, Arms, and Explosives (AA&amp;E) Category II. Some of the information related to the infrared and magnetic sensors is classified "Secret".

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF END ITEMS</p>
<p>Mine Clearing Blade:</p>
<p>- National Stock Number (NSN): 2590-01-230-8862<br />- Part Number: 13228E5945</p>
<p>The mine clearing blade, part number 13228E5945, directly mounts to the front of any M1 series Abrams tank. The blade is used to clear a path through mines that lie in front of the tanks. As the tank pushes the blade through a minefield, loose dirt and mines are rolled up onto moldboards. As the tank continues to push the blade, dirt and mines are pushed to the sides, clear of tracks. A chain and a dogbone assembly, integrated into the blade configuration and attached between the moldboards, detonates any tilt rod mines in the center lane. A control box located in the driver's compartment provides operator control for raising and lowering of the moldboards. A manual release system allows moldboards to be lowered to the plowing position in the event of electrical system failure.</p>
<p>RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Survey respondents must meaningfully address the entirety of this market survey. Respondents are requested to submit a statement, up to 10 pages in length, describing their interest, experience, and current capability to manufacture the mine clearing blade for the M1A2S Abrams series tank.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey - KSA M1A2S Rollers and Mounting Kits
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF INTENT</p>
<p>The Saudi Arabia Management Office (SAMO), located at Tank Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) in Warren, MI, is conducting a market survey to assess current market capability to produce mine clearing rollers and the associated mounting kits for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's M1A2S Abrams tanks.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF END ITEMS</p>
<p>Mine Clearing Roller:</p>
<p>- National Stock Number (NSN): 2590-01-134-3724<br />- Part Number: 13222E0327<br />- Specification Number: MIL-53007</p>
<p>Mounting Kit:</p>
<p>- NSN: 2590-01-235-5458<br />- Part Number: 13227E7180<br />- Specification Number: MIL-M-53077A</p>
<p>The mine clearing roller, part number 13222E0327, mounts to the front of any M1 series<br />Abrams tank via the mounting kit, part number 13227E7180. Once affixed to the tank via the mounting kit, the roller is used to detect and detonate single-impulse, pressure actuated mines in the tank's track path. The roller is also capable of neutralizing tiltrod actuated mines between track paths. Other applications include detecting minefields, proofing lanes which have been cleared by other means, breaching minefields, and pursing enemy tanks when minefields may be a threat.</p>
<p>The mounting kit provides the means to mount and release the roller on the tank. The mounting kit includes: a hydraulic system, two quick-disconnect mechanisms, two outboard mounting brackets, a center mounting bracket, two tie rods, and linkage (hook rod and lock rod) between the mounting brackets. The mounting brackets couple the rear of the pushbeams to the tank. Each quick-disconnect mechanism couples a pushbeam cable to the tank and is connected to the mounting brackets by a tie rod. The electrohydraulic pump is controlled by the Mine Roller Control Box (MRCB). The MRCB is located to the right of the driver. Power to the MRCB is supplied from the utility outlet on the hull networks distribution box and then to the pump by a set of relay contacts. On the M1A2 the MRCB is to the left rear of the driver. The MRCB power is supplied from the utility outlet on the Hull Power Distribution Unit (HPDU), through the Armored Junction Box (AJB), and external harness to the electrohydraulic pump."</p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified sources that are: Indian Small Business Economic Enterprises (ISBEEs) and other than small Indian Economic Enterprises (IEEs); and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, 611430, for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition set-aside.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The provision of health services to members of federally-recognized tribes grew out of the special government-to-government relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes. This relationship, established in 1787, is based on Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, and has been given form and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court decisions, and Executive Orders. The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people and its goal is to raise their health status to the highest possible level. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of 566 federally recognized Tribes across the U.S.</p>
<p>Over 80 percent of AI/AN children ages 6-9 and 13-15 years suffer from dental caries, while less than 50 percent of the U.S. population in the same age cohort have experienced cavities.    In addition to this disparity in prevalence, there is a significant disparity in severity of dental disease.  AI/AN children ages 2-5 years exhibit an average of four decayed teeth, while the same age group in the U.S. population averages one decayed tooth.  Across all age groups, AI/ANs suffer disproportionately from dental disease.  When compared to other racial or ethnic groups, AI/AN children 2-5 years old have more than double the number of decayed teeth and overall dental caries experience as the next highest ethnic group,  U.S. Hispanics, and more than four times that of U.S. white children.   In the 6-9 year-old age group, 8 out of 10 AI/AN children have a history of dental caries compared with only 45 percent of the general U.S. population, and almost half of AI/AN children have untreated tooth decay compared to just 17 percent of the general U.S. population in this age group.   In the 13-15 year-old age group, eight out of 10 AI/AN dental clinic patients have a history of tooth decay, compared to just 44 percent in the general U.S. population, and almost five times as many 13-15 year-old AI/AN youth have untreated  decay compared to the general U.S. population.   In adults, the disparity in disease is equally as pronounced.  64 percent of AI/AN adults 35-49 years have untreated decay compared to just 27 percent of the general U.S. population, and across all other age groups studied (50-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75 and older), AI/AN adults have more than double the prevalence of untreated tooth decay as the general U.S. population.  In addition, the rate of severe periodontal disease in AI/AN adults is almost double that of the general U.S. population.</p>

This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br />This procurement will be advertised under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 238290 - Other Building Equipment Contractors. The small business size standard for NAICS code 238290 is $15.0M in average annual receipts over the past three (3) years.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FY2018 Project Summary<br /><br /></span></strong>The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project to upgrade the&nbsp;machnies and controls of the&nbsp;building conveyance systems at the&nbsp;Nakamura United States Courthouse&nbsp;located at 1010 5th Avenue in Seattle, WA. Alterations will focus on completely upgrading the&nbsp;passenger&nbsp;elevators 1-4.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Building<br /></span></strong><br />&nbsp;<span style="BACKGROUND: white; COLOR: #333333; mso-highlight: white">Completed in 1940, the William Kenzo Nakamura U.S. Courthouse was the first single-<br />purpose federal courthouse in the western United States. The building represents the United States' commitment to democratic ideals and evokes the stability, permanence, and authority of the federal government. Opened ten years after the Great Depression halted virtually all Seattle construction, the building signaled the potential for new growth in downtown Seattle and substantial federal investment in the region. Constructed on the former site of Seattle's first hospital, the Nakamura Courthouse cost $1.7 million to complete and brought together federal agencies previously scattered throughout the city. These included the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Clerk's Office, Probation Office, Secret Service, and the Alcohol Tax Unit. Additionally, naturalization ceremonies for immigrants to the Pacific Northwest occurred here. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, now the principal tenant, moved into the courthouse in the early 1970s.</span><br /><br />The proposed project will upgrade the&nbsp;machines and controls of the four existing traction passenger elevators by providing a code compliant system that will improve safety, reliability, and serviceability. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification</span></strong><br /><br />The elevator system is more than 40 years old and nearing the end of its&nbsp;useful life.&nbsp; The current passenger cabs will not be replaced due to modernization in 2009.&nbsp; The modernization effort will be focused on the aging gears and drives of the current elevator system. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Energy Compliance<br /></span></strong><br />This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy&nbsp;efficiency above the minimum performance criteria.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description &amp; Approach</span></strong><br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build<br />Contract Type: Firm Fixed Price<br />Magnitude of Construction: $1.5M to $2.0M<br />Source Selection: Best Value in accordance with FAR Part 15.3 considering technical factors and price<br />Scope: See attached Project Development Study<br /><br /><br />The&nbsp;GSA envisions a highly collaborative design build delivery approach for this project where the DB contractor works closely with all stakeholders to deliver a project that meets the expectations and needs of both the team members and GSA's requirements to deliver an economical and operationally efficient elevator modernization project.<br /><br />As required by law, the facility must meet federal energy goals. The project is also to include conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings) and all other applicable building codes and standards.<br /><br />The DB team will be evaluated with the technical and price factors provided. During the development period from initial concept to final design the DB team will work in close consultation with GSA, the stakeholders and the CMa to ensure that all of the goals are addressed and that best&nbsp;practices are utilized.<br /><br />GSA will be contracting separately for Construction Management Assistant (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be an informal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution including&nbsp;the project kick-off meeting. The CMa will also perform Elevator Inspection services. All installed elevator systems will be fully commissioned and functionally tested to ensure compliance with contract documents prior to being accepted by GSA.<br /><br /><strong>Unique Situations/Risks<br /></strong>The need for continuous operations during construction presents unique challenges for the design/build teams on the project. Facility will remain fully occupied and operational during the entire project. No adverse impact on tenant mission will be acceptable.<br /><br /><strong>Occupied Facility Construction</strong><br /><br />This project scope at the&nbsp;William Kenzo Nakamura Courthouse&nbsp;Elevator Design Build Modernization must occur within an occupied, fully functional facility. These functions include typical office work, but also include services for the general public.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for March  is March 1, 2018 to March 7,2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG10 and must be located within Region 10.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sources Sought/Request for Information Coralville Control Tower Sill Repair</strong></span>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong> <br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran- owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their understanding, capabilities and experience relative to the proposed acquisition to assist the Government in determining the expectation of receiving bids from responsible small business contractors at fair market prices. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set- aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code can submit a response to this notice, however their capabilities may/may not be assessed for the purposes of this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers (COE), Rock Island District does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received, however as a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the COE may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the Project Requirements to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> <br /><br />At Coralville Dam, there is heavy leakage (150cfs) present at the three service gates at the control structure. The leakage persists even when emergency control gate is lowered. Full inspections are not possible because of the inability to perform underwater inspection due to the leakage. Exterior bulkhead slots exist, which can block flow upstream of the emergency control gate, but no bulkheads currently exist for this location. Fabrication and installation of the exterior bulkhead will allow for repairs at both the emergency and service control gate sealing surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Coralville Control Tower Concrete and Sill Plate Repairs. The project includes fabrication, delivery and installation of bulkheads to dewater three intake bays for the water control gates. Following bulkhead installation and sealing, and construction of a temporary dewatering structure on the downstream end of the intake bay, the control gate sills will be inspected, with options to repair any damage. The repairs are anticipated to include removal and replacement of brass seal plates, removal and replacement of the steel conduit liner (which includes fabrication of steel plating), and removal and replacement of concrete around the conduit liner (which includes reinforcement bars and/or anchor bar placement).</p>
<p>Access to the bulkhead placement location is by a minimally maintained road, which winds thru significant tree growth and has limited width. There are no provisions on site to place/remove the bulkheads. The sill repair area is 97 feet below the main working level, and is under approximately 4 feet of water even when bulkheads are placed in the bay, requiring dewatering of the area. Access to the sill repair area for personnel, material delivery, such as dewatering structures and repair components, is limited by control gate bay dimensions, unless delivered by boat from the outlet structure approximately 450 feet downstream of the work area. The sill is located in a confined space and all criteria for working in a confined space will be required.</p>
<p>Bulkhead placement and dewatering, including sill repairs, will primarily be constructed in the fall - winter months of 2019 and 2020, due to water regulation requirements at the site. Construction will need to be staged/sequenced such that flood risk management is maintained during construction, and may require short notice by the government to remove bulkheads and put the control gate back in service.</p>
<p><strong>NAICS Code and Size Standard:</strong></p>
<p>In the event an RFP is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237990 with a size standard of $36.5M is being considered.</p>
<p>Solicitation Type: The Government is considering using a Best Value Trade Off Method for solicitation of this project. Potential evaluation factors could be Technical; to include, Material Delivery, High Water Contingency, Dewatering Experience and Planning, and Confined Space experience/capabilities; Price; Past Performance and Small Business Participation. Please provide any feedback on the potential solicitation and evaluation method, as well as appropriate provisions and considerations for these types of solicitations and evaluations, from an industry perspective.</p>

SECTION 508
NOTICE OF THE FEDERAL ACCESSIBILITY LAW AFFECTING ALL ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENTS 

On August 7, 1998, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended to require that when Federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology, that they shall ensure it allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees. Section 508 required the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) to publish standards setting forth a definition of electronic and information technology and the technical and functional criteria for such technology to comply with Section 508.

<DESC>RFI, webSTAIR Adaptation Services

VA Acquisition Sensitive   pre-decisional working draft   for Internal VA use only.  Page 1
Request for Information
webSTAIR Adaptation Services

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information provided.  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center is issuing this RFI to determine Contractors capabilities in executing the requirements of the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) [Attachment 1].

BACKGROUND
The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Dissemination and Training Division (NCPTSD), part of VA, is responsible for creating training and educational products to support evidence-based care of Veterans with PTSD and related problems. PTSD is, unfortunately, very common among Veterans and has a significant impact on Veterans  quality of life. Most Veterans with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatments for PTSD, and many Veterans are either unable to or choose not to access available mental health services of any kind. Lack of available services, distance from clinics, and stigma associated with mental health care are just a few of the barriers to providing care for Veterans and those living with a Veteran with PTSD. NCPTSD has developed software applications for the web and mobile devices to overcome these and other barriers to care. The applications are designed to assist Veterans and their family members with understanding PTSD and related problems, tracking their improvement over time, obtaining support and resources, and managing symptoms using a variety of brief tools.

STAIR (Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Relationships) is an evidence-based coping skills intervention for individuals (both Veteran and non-Veteran) who have experienced a traumatic event and are having emotion management and relationship difficulties. VA has developed a direct-to-consumer, web-based program for STAIR (webSTAIR) as a self-guided and/or clinician-supported intervention that is interactive, engaging and user friendly. The evaluation version of webSTAIR (currently in production/sustainment) collects de-identified user/patient evaluation data and is currently being hosted externally by Allen Interactions, Inc. The application developed by Allen Interactions, Inc. also contains a dashboard capability that permits VA clinicians to view and analyze user/patient progress and evaluation data.  A general use version (with no data collection capability) is currently under development and will be run on an internal VA server which is hosting the NCPTSD website (www.ptsd.va.gov).

STAIR is a sequential skills training program with eleven modules (1 welcome module, 9 treatment modules, 1 conclusion module).  VA has developed the application to be automated and self-managed but with the option for sharing usage, symptom data and symptom change data with a mental health provider. In addition to the nine treatment modules, the application includes two additional modules: a welcome module to orient consumers to the training program and a conclusion module for reflecting on the experience and completing follow-up assessments. Everyone visiting the evaluation version of the site passes through an offline screener that includes brief demographic and symptom questionnaires. Users who decide to enroll are given a secure login account and password. Enrolled users undergo a more detailed baseline clinical assessment comprised of several standardized questionnaires administered over the phone by a project assessment coordinator.  The login account is then used by the Veteran user to sign in for subsequent visits.

The following interactive components are included.  The participant is able to:  
Receive personalized feedback based on the scoring of assessment questionnaires.
Read personalized psychoeducational content on-the-fly according to assessment results, user-supplied feedback and reports, and other criteria.
Set weekly skills practice goals and planning exercises using on-screen interactive worksheets and widgets.
Report their weekly progress on their skills goals and actual skills practice, receive personalized feedback, and view week-to-week progress on a dynamic graph.
Print out a personalized module summary and weekly plan for offline use between modules.

On return visits, users are presented with a personalized home screen showing completed, incomplete and newly available modules. Users can review the skills and worksheet content from completed modules through specific handouts in the form of a static Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Users can re-take any of the modules.  At the end of the nine core treatment modules, a final module is available for users to complete a follow-up assessment comprised of a subset of questionnaires as in the pre-program assessment module and at the first entry of any new module. Users are also invited to complete more in-depth follow-up assessments at the conclusion of their webSTAIR experience and once again in three months through quantitative and qualitative interviews conducted offline.  Users in the evaluation version are reminded to return for scheduled or incomplete modules and assessments.

RESPONSE
VA is trying to determine vendor capability to provide software development and application hosting support to make further adaptations (i.e., modifications, enhancements, etc.) to the evaluation and general use versions of webSTAIR and continue the system hosting of the evaluation version currently in use by Veterans and VA clinicians, as outlined in the requirements identified throughout Section 5 of the draft PWS [Attachment 1].

<SOLNBR>DHS-8FEB18-NOTICE_TO_INDUSTRY
<CONTACT>Procurement Support, Email procurementsupport@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>Dear Industry Partner,
<p><br />This is to advise the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractor community of the DHS plans regarding actions that may be necessary in the event that contract funding is affected by a lapse in appropriations.</p>
<p>As you are aware, a full year appropriation has not been enacted for the current fiscal year and the current continuing resolution expires today, which may result in a lapse in the funds designated to purchase certain supplies and services, as well as a reduction in the Government's capacity to administer DHS contracts.  As a consequence, certain planned procurements may be cancelled or postponed and certain existing contracts may be delayed, stopped, reduced in scope, or terminated.  Additionally, contract invoice payments may be delayed.  Contractors will be notified once funding is available and the Government has returned to normal operations.</p>
<p>Should DHS determine that any of these actions are necessary, if a lapse occurs, the contracting officer for each affected contract will promptly provide appropriate notice to the contractor counterpart in accordance with the terms and conditions of the affected contract.  The notice will contain the direction necessary to adjust the contract due to the lapse in the appropriations.</p>
<p>If a contract will not be affected at the onset of the lapse in appropriations, DHS does not plan to provide any separate notifications or communications of that fact.  Unless the contracting officer provides a formal notification to the contrary, all DHS contractors must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued partnership supporting DHS's mission during this funding uncertainty.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Soraya Correa<br />Chief Procurement Officer</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD), Norfolk Office, using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 13, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Rockwell Automation, Inc., located at 1201 S 2nd St, Milwaukee, WI, 53204, for an  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contract for inspection and maintenance services for highly specialized main propulsion and bow thruster systems onboard the NOAA Ships Pisces, Bell M. Shimada, and Rueben Lasker.
<p>The NOAA ships Pisces, Bell M. Shimada, and Rueben Lasker have specially designed motors allowing them to operate as highly effective, ultra-quiet fisheries survey vessels. The propulsion motors on these vessels are specially constructed and balanced to reduce noise and vibration. This special design allows scientists to use hydroacoustic methods for surveying marine life, and significantly reduces changes in the natural behavior of animals owing to the ship noise. In addition, the vessel can collect a variety of oceanographic data while marine life surveys are underway, resulting in more efficiently collected data. This reduced noise signature has improved NOAA's ability to accurately assess fish stocks and to compare standardized data with the international fisheries scientific community.</p>
<p>In order to maintain and maximize the useful life of these systems NOAA is looking for the OEM to inspect and maintain the vessels' main propulsion and bow thruster systems. This is to include proper function of the motors, drives, and any components that support function of these systems. NOAA intends to award an IDIQ contract with a base ordering year and four subsequent one year ordering periods.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 336611, Ship Building and Repairing, with a business size standard of 1,250 employees.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  A statement of capabilities must be received by 12:00 PM EST on February 12, 2018.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.  Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Contract Specialist Alex Cooper at alexander.cooper@noaa.gov by 12:00 PM EST on February 12, 2018.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent for Sole Source - Horiba Aqualog UV-800-C Compact, Fluorescenc
<SOLNBR>68HE0D18Q0033
<ARCHDATE>02142018
<CONTACT>Day, Harold
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Research Triangle Park (RTP) in Durham, North Carolina intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to Horiba Scientific in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1) soliciting from a single source to purchase a Horiba Aqualog UV-800-C Compact, Fluorescence/Absorbance Spectrometer System. This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition.

EPAs National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Exposure Methods & Measurements Division, Air Quality Branch (AQB) is needing a Horiba Aqualog UV-800-C Compact, Fluorescence/Absorbance Spectrometer System to be used in connection with studies on the release of single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from CNT-plastic composites. 

The system will be used in connection with studies on the release of single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from CNT-plastic composites.  Two key parameters for characterizing and quantifying CNTs are their absorbance and fluorescence spectra.  The Horiba Aqualog is the only unit on the market that has dual-capability for measuring absorbance and fluorescence simultaneously. Another key feature is their PARAFAC  analysis software which has the capability of processing raw data into Excitation-Emission Matrices.  A market survey indicates that these combined features are only available on the Horiba Aqualog system.  In addition to supporting EMMDs NanoRelease efforts, the instrument will be made available, when possible, to other EMMD studies involving irradiation of nanomaterials, as well as photoinactivation of microorganisms.  Data and relationships derived from these nanomaterial studies will be used to develop protocols for evaluation of the release of nanomaterials from solid materials such as polymers and coatings.  The results will also be used in the development of mathematical models that evaluate photoinactivation of pathogens and their microbial indicators as well as the transformations and persistence of nanomaterials and their commercial formulations.
This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. This notice of intent is for information purposes only; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. 

All capability statements received within 7 days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide the services outlined and itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Jody R. Criss, Phone 6016345248, Email Jody.Criss@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), has a requirement to purchase high-performance concrete that can be made in a precast setting. In recent years, the ERDC has developed a specific family of high performance concrete mixtures. The laboratory-scale mechanical performance of each of these mixtures has been extensively characterized. The ERDC has a requirement to produce pre-cast items for mechanical testing that cannot be made at the laboratory scale. The Tindall Corporation facility located in Conley, GA is the only concrete facility that has the steam curing capabilities, formwork construction capability, high shear mixer (non-revolving drum), and which stocks portland cement and aggregates from the sources previously used to produce the OHPC laboratory-scale mixtures. In order to maintain consistency of research data, any changes to constituent materials must be avoided as the size of the items being cast increases from the laboratory scale. Any changes to the process used to produce the laboratory scale items could significantly change the mechanical performance of the OHPC and invalidate previous testing and modeling efforts. The award will be issued in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). The NAICS code for this requirement is 327390 (Other Concrete Product Manufacturing) with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. A solicitation will not be issued. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The information submitted must be provided in sufficient detail to demonstrate the vendor's ability to fulfill this requirement. The contractor must also provide a description of their past experience in fulfilling requirements which are the same or similar to this requirement and references for each.</p>
<p>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses to this requirement may be submitted to Jody Criss at Jody.Criss@usace.army.mil. The solicitation number shall be included in the subject line of the e-mail submission. Responses must be received no later than 15 days from the posted date of this notice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">IN APPROXIMATELY 1 DAY, THE SOLICITATION FOR THIS COMMERCIAL SERVICE PROJECT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO VIEW AND PRINT.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCOPE OF WORK</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to hand thin and hand pile in the treatment units described in this contract to remove suppressed, diseased, damaged, and poorly formed trees in order to restore forest health and resistance/resilience to wildfire. Piling of cut and downed material while leaving larger coarse woody debris will reduce fuel loading while maintaining Forest Plan Standards. Snags (dead/dying trees) that may pose a threat to firefighters or the public (those near fuel breaks, roads, recreation sites) will be removed while retaining those that likely will not pose risk for wildlife habitat. Aspen, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir will not be cut (where they exist) to encourage both biodiversity and fire-adapted species.</p>
<p>The Rock Creek Project aims to restore forest health and diversity, fire-resistance/fire-resilience, and reduce the risk of wildfire negatively impacting the Rock Creek Recreation Complex. Thinning forest stands will reduce ladder fuels and fuel continuity, resulting in decreased crown fire risk and improving firefighter and public safety. <br />The Environmental Analysis prepared for the project outlines design specifications for treatments that will result in desired conditions found within the Sawtooth National Forest Plan. These specifications (described in this document in detail) will allow for removal of suppressed, poorly-formed, damaged and diseased trees while maintaining coarse-woody debris levels and wildlife snags. Additional piling of ground fuels where uncharacteristic build-up has occurred will also be required to create adequate fuel loading levels to alter surface fire behavior.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTACT STEVE CLEZIE AT (208) 737-3256 FOR MORE INFORMATION.</span></strong></p>
<p>CONTRACT TIME WILL BE 140 calendar days with an estimated start date of 07/15/2018 with a completion date of November 30, 2018. NAICS Code: 115310 Size Standard: $7.5. This proposed procurement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS set-aside.</p>

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT TO BE ACQUIRED<br />Performance Work Statement<br />Regional Innovation (RI) Program Evaluation
<p>1. BACKGROUND<br />Housed within the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA), the Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIE) works to foster a more innovative U.S. economy focused on turning new ideas and inventions into products, services, and innovative companies that spur job growth and competitiveness while promoting economic development. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 statutorily established OIE and its mission: "to foster innovation and the commercialization of new technologies, products, processes, and services with the goal of promoting productivity and economic growth in the United States." 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3720(a).<br />OIE operates the Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS) Program (the Program), which was created under EDA's Regional Innovation (RI) program authorities. 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3722(b); see also 13 C.F.R. Part 312; U.S. Economic Development Administration, Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS) Program, https://www.eda.gov/oie/ris/. In order to retain and increase global competitiveness and to realize job growth, regions must build public and private capacity to invent, improve, and bring to market new products and services. The Program provides funding that builds these capacities at the regional level and empowers communities to provide proof-of-concept and commercialization assistance to innovators and entrepreneurs and operational support for organizations that provide essential early-stage funding to startups, ultimately aiming to support growing, resilient, and vibrant economies throughout the United States.<br />Since 2014, OIE has awarded nearly $57 million in Federal funding that has leveraged more than $66 million in local matching funds across 140 grants in 40 States and Puerto Rico. This funding has supported a variety of projects, including projects that provide business and technical assistance, mentoring and support networks, and increased access to early-stage capital.<br />2. OBJECTIVE<br />EDA has a statutory obligation to evaluate its implementation of the Program. 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3722(e).

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>

<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /> <br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>1330-52.237-71 Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the is(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-72 Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>

<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016) NAM</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /> <br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.<br />(f) The contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such safety precautions as necessary, including suitable and sufficient lighting, for the prevention of accidents or injury to persons or property during the prosecution of work under this contract and/or from time of receipt of the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the work performed.<br />(g) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel is in the custody of the contractor or in dry dock or on a marine railway and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or other proper means, as approved by the COR.<br />(h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.<br />(i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. Prior to submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of proposals. If the contractor, as a result of inspection or otherwise, discovers any error in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications, it shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the error and proceed in accord with instructions received from the Contracting Officer. The Government is not liable for any claims or charges resulting from additional work performed by the contractor as a result of a patent ambiguity in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications that was not brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall be responsible for the correctness of the shape, sizes and dimensions of parts furnished by the contractor under the contract.<br />(j) The contractor shall at all times keep the site of the work on the vessel free from accumulation of waste material or rubbish caused by contractor employees or the work, and at the completion of the work shall remove all rubbish from and about the site of the work and shall leave the work and its immediate vicinity "broom-clean" unless more exactly specified in this contract.<br />(k) While in drydock or on a marine railway, the contractor shall be responsible for the closing, before the end of working hours, of all valves and openings upon which work is being done by its workers when such closing is practicable.

<p>1352.271-71 - Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)<br />(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned.

<p>1352.271-72 - Additional Item Requirements (Air)-Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes-Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule:<br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance.<br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:<br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging.<br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:<br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided.<br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.<br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.

The Work Package Network shall show the work items, milestones, key events, and activities and shall clearly identify the critical path. The Total Manpower Loading Curve shall show the required manning for the duration of the contract. The Trade Manning Curves shall show the required manning for each trade for the duration of the contract. The Subcontracting List shall show work items, milestones, key events, and activities to be accomplished by subcontractors.<br />(c) Additional Item Requirements ordered and agreed upon, whether or not yet formalized via a change order (contract modification), shall be added to the Production Schedule, Trade Manning Curves, and Subcontracting List and submitted to the Contracting Officer and COR at each weekly Progress Meeting. Any anticipated or unanticipated deviation (greater than five (5) calendar days) from the Production Schedule shall be immediately brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer and COR.<br />(d) Any unauthorized deviation in the Production Schedule which results in a delay in the completion of work on a vessel past the established performance period completion date may entitle the Government to remedies for late performance, including, but not limited to, liquidated damages.  (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-74 - Foreseeable Cost Factors Pertaining to Different Shipyard Locations (APR 2010)<br />(a) The Contracting Officer will evaluate certain foreseeable costs that will vary with the location of the commercial shipyard to be used by bidders/offerors under this solicitation. Costs will be calculated based on the bidder's/offeror's shipyard location and these costs will be added, for the purposes of evaluation only, to the bidder's/offeror's overall price.<br />(b) These elements of foreseeable costs consist of the following:<br />(1) Vessel Transit: (i) Vessel delivery costs will be based on one round trip from the vessel's homeport of ________ to the contractor's facility at a cruising speed of __ knots. Distances will be based on the NOAA publication, "Distance Between U.S. Ports".<br />(ii) Daily vessel operational cost to navigate the vessel between its homeport and the contractor's offered place of performance is $____ per day.

<p>1352.271-77 - Delays (APR 2010)<br />When, during the performance of this contract, the contractor is required to delay the work on a vessel temporarily, due to orders or actions of the Government respecting stoppage of work to permit shifting the vessel, stoppage of hot work to permit bunkering, fueling, embarking or debarking of passengers or loading or discharging of cargo, and the contractor is not given sufficient advance notice or is otherwise unable to avoid incurring additional costs on account thereof, an equitable adjustment may be made in the contract. Any such request for equitable adjustment shall be asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the delay or disruption, but not later than the day of final payment under the contract.  (End of clause)<br />1352.271-78 - Minimization of Delay Due to Government Furnished Property (APR 2010)<br />(a) In order to assure timely performance under this contract, it is imperative that delay in the contract's performance period resulting from late, damaged, or unsuitable Government furnished property be held to an absolute minimum. In order to achieve minimization of delay, it is agreed that:<br />(1) Subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Government shall deliver each item of Government furnished property to the contractor on or before the date specified in the contract or, if later, in sufficient time for the contractor to meet the contract performance period.<br />(2) The Government may forego furnishing any item of Government property to the contractor. In that event, the contractor shall prepare the vessel in terms of piping, wiring, structure, foundation, ventilation, and any other pre-installation requirements of the item, so that the work on the vessel may continue without delay and disruption resulting from the absence of the item. If the Government does not furnish an item designated as Government furnished property, the contract price may be adjusted accordingly.<br />(b) The delivery or performance dates for the supplies or services to be furnished by the contractor under this contract are based upon the expectation that Government furnished property suitable for use (except for such property furnished "as is") will be delivered to the contractor at the time stated in the specification or, if not so stated, in sufficient time to enable the contractor to meet such delivery or performance dates. If the Government furnished property is not furnished in the time stated in the contract, or, if a date is not specified, and the late delivery does not give the contractor sufficient time to enable the contractor to meet required contract delivery or performance dates, the contractor shall notify the Government in writing of the late delivery. Notification shall include cost and schedule impacts, including delays and disruptions to schedules. This notification shall be submitted as soon as practical or known.<br />(c) The provisions in subsection (b) of this clause and in FAR 52.245-1, if applicable, provide the exclusive remedies to the contractor resulting from delay in delivery of Government furnished property or delivery of such property in a condition not suitable for its intended use.

<p>1352.271-79 - Liability and Insurance (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.<br />(b) The contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government-owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the contractor's control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantially all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.<br />(c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.<br />(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, however, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work.

The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance. Except at its own cost, the contractor shall not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of the event.
