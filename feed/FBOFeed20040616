<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure the continuation of services on a sole source basis from Project of Intermediate Advocates, Inc. (PIA), Washington, DC. The purpose of this procurement is to continue collaborations with PIA to offer access to healthcare information with a focus on HIV/AIDS information to disadvantaged individuals and communities. PIA is a non-profit organization based in Southeast Washington DC, a historically low-income African-American community. PIA has worked as a healthcare advocate for over five years in this community to change the disparity in healthcare currently present. PIA can offer the Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) an opportunity to further accomplish its outreach mission at a level not currently possible through current SIS staff and/or contractors The proposed acquisition is a small business set aside and will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisition of Non-Commercial Items. 

PIA offers the A.H.E.A.D. Initiative—a certificate-based, hands-on computer workshop for people living with HIV and their caregivers.  Monthly training-workshops host HIV positive persons where trainers teach basic Web navigation skills. The training teaches evaluation strategies for electronic information, and offers specific accessibility skills in Web resources on HIV/AIDS and other health issues.  PIA’s primary objective has been to teach people to access quality electronic health information from the Internet and to translate it for themselves and their community.  PIA has worked successfully for 4 yrs, training HIV positive individuals in using the Internet to access medical libraries that offers creditable health information addressing life with HIV/AIDS. 

Community demonstrations remain the main method of entrée into the community-based organizations and for recruiting people for the training. This model is unique because it offers proactive persons living with AIDS (PWAs), training, employment, advocacy and entrepreneurship. The project includes a stipend program that pays trained HIV positive residents of the District to demonstrate the resources and training to other PWAs in support groups, HIV Day Treatment Centers and other community settings. Involvement in this  program has built self-esteem, medical adherence and a positive attitude living with HIV/AIDS and is giving PWAs a real purpose coupled with meaningful association. PIA is developing teams of demonstrators; each team will use a laptop and LCD projector (provided by PIA) to demonstrate the training and offer return visits to conduct health information sessions. Teams will be assigned specific community associations/organization; etc Public Libraries, Churches, Schools and Medical Centers and will consist of one female and one male—both proactive HIV positive persons.    The Period of Performance is one (01) year from the effective date of award.

Proposals from a team of university investigators may be warranted because the necessary expertise in addressing the multiple facets of the topics may reside in different universities, or in different departments in the same university.  By supporting multidisciplinary teams, the program is complementary to other DoD basic research programs that support university research through single-investigator awards.  Proposals must name one Principal Investigator as the responsible technical point of contact.  Similarly, one institution will be the primary awardee for the purpose of award execution.  The relationship among participating institutions and their respective roles, as well as the apportionment of funds including sub-awards, if any, must be described in both the proposal text and the budget.

Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) (as defined by 10 U.S.C. 2323a (1) (c)) are encouraged to participate in the MURI program, either as the lead institution or as a member of a team.  However, no specific funds are allocated for HBCU/MI participation. The White Papers due date is 12 AUG 2004 and the Full Proposals due date is 11 NOV 2004.

<DESC>Pursuant to and in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intention to purchase aircraft honeycomb panels on a single source basis from Simula, Inc. of Phoenix, Arizona.  A competitive solicitation will NOT be available for this procurement. The Fire Safety Branch, AAR-440, had previously purchased these same aircraft honeycomb panels for fire testing.  To have the necessary continuity in testing results, panels with the exact same fire properties must be purchased.  Using different panels would cause all previous fire testing to become invalid.  Therefore, the panels must be purchased through the same vendor. If there are any questions regarding this announcement, please call Chris Gallagher, (609) 485-6324 or e-mail at chris.gallagher@faa.gov.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to RD-Tech Instruments for repair of a Panametrics Model 5800 C-Scan non-destructive test unit. This service is being acquired for the Department of Engineering Mechanics, US Air Force Academy.  The X and Y drive motors on the C-Scan tank are operating intermittently. The operating system (MS-DOS 5.0) and the Multiscan MEI 6.0 software are obsolete and no longer supported. The system requires an upgrade to include a new computer (the interface boards from our old computer will be transferred to the new computer) with Windows 2000 operating system, Scanview 6.8 software, Multiscan 6.29 software, X and Y drive motors and associated cables will be replaced. The motor drive box and all interface boards will be inspected and functionally verified on an identical C-Scan tank system. 
 Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.   No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by June 23, 2004 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with RD-Tech Instruments a sole source award will be made.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE:  This requirement is for the procurement of a qualified construction contractor to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Removal and Replacement of the Exterior Aluminum Curtain Wall, windows and entries of the John F. Kennedy Federal Office Building, Boston MA. The facility consists of a main lobby and connecting link, a high rise tower of twenty four stories with windows, two stair towers and curtain walls, two entries of one and two stories with curtain walls and a low rise building of four stories over a basement parking level. The building exterior façade is constructed of pre-cast concrete panels with operable windows.  The work includes but is not limited to the removal and replacement of all windows and curtain wall systems; and new entrances. The major portion of the work will be completed during off-hours to accommodate continued occupancy by the government during construction. This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is 64 weeks. 

The successful firm must have previous experience with construction projects of similar size and scope with particular emphasis in off hour renovations in occupied buildings.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: Window replacement of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $5 million dollars or more and/or window replacement projects in occupied high rise buildings of approximately $5 million dollars or more. In addition, the successful contractor will be required to provide engineering services for design with experience in Glass Retention, and to demonstrate compliance of the proposed curtain wall and window systems with the project requirements. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated project cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the “best value” to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach,  subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.   

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance Window Replacement projects of similar size and complexity, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing window replacement projects in an occupied high rise building.
3 Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan including management control, quality 
    assurance, coordination and small business category goals.

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238150, Size standard is $12 million.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209) is tasked to provide supplies and services in support of the AN/ARC-182(V) Reuse Program.

Estimated quantities for each of these items range from 5 to 76 units per year with a required delivery schedule beginning five to twelve months after contract award or option exercise.  Delivery shall be made to various locations throughout the continental United States as well as to FMS customers.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture LCAC Deep Skirt System Components.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, Landing Craft, Air Cushion, project peculiar document, Skirt Material Characteristics and requirements dated 01 APRIL 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, Landing Craft, Air Cushion Project peculiar document, Skirt Fabrication procedures dated 01 April 1996, Revision B.  To date only Be ll Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Award will be based on the written quotation. The anticipated award date will be on or about June 30, 2004. NAICS Code 326291 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.

<DESC>PreSolicitation Notice for Onyx Image Generator Computer Upgrade & Multi-Function Cubical Visual System for the 
Royal Saudi Naval Force’s (RSNF) Full Mission Bridge Trainer (FMBT)

The Naval Air Systems Command, (NAVAIR) Training Systems Division Orlando intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract on a sole source basis to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) – Defense Engineering Services Division, Washington, DC for system upgrade and engineering support to the RSNF FMBT.  The Government requirements consist of replacing the current Onyx image generators with PC based image generators, procurement of a multi-functional cubical visual system, and along with the procurement of these two systems, NAVAIR intends to procure training for the installation of these systems.  The FMBT currently is located on the King Abdul Aziz Naval Base in Jubail, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but training will be provided in the United States, with follow-on technical assistance if required.  The Government anticipates awarding this contract sometime before January 2005.  CSC is the only contractor that currently has the design and technical data knowledge to provide the upgrade, visual system and training for the FMBT trainer, and procurement of another design/development effort would not be cost effective for the Government.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Number Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is pleased to offer the opportunity to respond to the Integrator-Broker for the J-UCAS Common Operating System (COS) solicitation. Proposal are due no later than 26 July 2004.  The solicitation can be viewed as an attachment to this announcement. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program is a joint DARPA-Air Force-Navy effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility, military utility and operational value of a networked system of high performance, weaponized unmanned air vehicles to effectively and affordably prosecute 21st century combat missions.  The J-UCAS program has been architected to fully exploit the technological advances emerging from the ongoing information revolution, so as to provide new options for advanced airpower projection that can support a variety of 21st century military missions. Within the J-UCAS Program Office, the Common Systems & Technology (CST) organization is tasked with the development and testing of a number of common systems, subsystems and components that comprise the integrated system. CSTs most visible and challenging task is the development of the J-UCAS Common Operating System (COS). The COS will enable interoperability among multiple air vehicles and control stations, facilitating the integration of other subsystems such as sensors, weapons, and communications.  The COS encompasses the software architecture, algorithms, applications and services  that provide command and control, communications management, mission planning, much of the interactive autonomy, the human systems interface and the many other qualities associated with the J-UCAS system.  The J-UCAS system architecture will ensure intra-operability between the internal components of J-UCAS and inter-operability with external elements such as manned aircraft, command and control centers, and space assets. This solicitation seeks a COS development and implementation solution involving a consortium-like business arrangement (hereafter referred to as the consortium) that involves the programs air vehicle (A/V) prime contractors, an assortment of technology contributors organizations, and a unique entity known as the Integrator/Broker (I/B).  The current A/V primes, the Boeing Company and the Northrop Grumman Corporation, are key stakeholders that may directly contribute software functionality to the COS and are exclusively responsible for integrating the COS with their own platforms.  Technology contributors will be selected to provide best of breed algorithms and software functionality to the COS.  Their involvement in the envisioned consortium agreement is based on the specific potential contributions that may enhance or expand COS capabilities.  Technology contributors may include small developers, other large defense contractors, and traditional or nontraditional subcontractors.  The Integrator/Broker (I/B) has a unique role in facilitating the COS integration process among the other participants in the consortium.  The I/B is not considered a large scale integrator or a Lead System Integrator (LSI) in the traditional sense. The technical point-of-contact is Marc Pitarys at FAX no. 703-248-1939.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance to improve the quality and reliability of its power distribution systems for metropolitan Jakarta.

Indonesia’s electricity infrastructure is one of the leading constraints to the country’s overall economic development.  Manufacturers have increased their electricity utilization rates, often operating factories at full capacity in response to global competitive pressures.  The reliability of the electricity supply has become a key factor in the productivity of these factories as automated processes have increased.  In response, P.T. Perusahaan Listrik Negara Persero (PLN), Indonesia’s national electric power utility, is striving to improve its traditional reliability indices as measured by System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI), and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).  PLN provides power distribution services for the entire metropolitan area of Jakarta – Indonesia’s capital and one of world’s major cities, with a population of more than 10 million.  Over the past ten years, PLN has invested in its infrastructure enough to balance the supply and demand for power, with only a small shortage during peak load periods.  Although supply reliability has improved, the growing demand for power will soon strain PLN’s resources.  This distribution project fits into PLN’s strategy for improving reliability and power quality.  The average availability of power at the meter must be above 99.9% (i.e., power is available 99.9% of the time and outages occur less than 0.1% of the time).  In addition to having power that is available, that power must be high quality and free from voltage disturbances and interruptions.  Even momentary interruptions and voltage sags become critical for power customers with sensitive manufacturing equipment and processes.

The Technical Assistance will develop an implementation plan that will help PLN to make better investment decisions that will lead to improved distribution services in this economically vital region.  The Technical Assistance will conduct: 1) Engineering, Systems Losses and System R/PQ; 2) Review Substation Monitoring and Communications; 3) Perform On-Site Audits of Three Major Customers; 4) Review Metering and Monitoring Systems; 5) Examine Grantee’s Operations and Maintenance from the Viewpoint of Systems R/PQ; 6) Provide Recommendations on the Current Status and any Changes that May Be Needed in Equipment and Operating Procedures that Shall Enhance R/PQ; 7)Review Current Information Technology Operating Environment and Business Requirements; 8) Prepare Recommendations in Support of an Integrated IT System to Support R/PQ Activities; and 9) Prepare Procurement Related Information. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $340,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 P.M., JULY 29, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: 
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance to improve the quality and reliability of the 150kV power transmission lines along the Java-Bali grid.

Electricity production in Indonesia has steadily increased during the past ten years to meet growing power demands; these high growth rates are expected to continue for the next 10 to 15 years.  P.T. Perusahaan Listrik Negara Persero (PLN), is Indonesia’s national electric power utility.  PLN is undergoing many changes on account of this growth and of the law passed in 2000 that changed the structure of PLN and the entire Indonesian power industry.  PLN’s transmission grid is expanding, adding and improving capacity to meet the high voltage requirements on the islands of Java and Bali.  The utility currently has a 500kV line serving the Java-Bali transmission system, with several new branches under construction.  Along these routes, the lines are stepped down to 150kV lines to supply large areas and customers. These lines are stepped down further to 20kV for PLN’s distribution systems.  The amount of power loss from the transmission lines is around 2%.  PLN officials have stated that they do not need assistance with the 500kV or the 20kV lines, but they do need help improving the reliability and power quality on the 150kV lines and substations. 

The Technical Assistance will develop a management and investment plan for the enhancement of the quality and reliability of the Java-Bali power grid network and to ensure that future expansion maintains the required level of power delivery excellence.  The Technical Assistance will conduct: 1) Evaluation of the 500kV – 150kV, and 150kV – 20kV Interconnections and the improvements necessary to satisfy power exchanges for the year 2004 and beyond; 2) Technical Studies of the 150kV Transmission Systems and Interconnections; 3) Impact on existing work; 4) Definition of devices used to regulate voltage and compensate for reactive energy; 5) Determination of the Technical limits of Exchanges of Active Energy in Normal Mode and in Disrupted Mode; 6) Prepare an Estimation of losses for the Different Periods and as a Function of Different Scenarios; 7) Define of an Optimal Remote Regulating System that Ensures Good Quality; 8) Study of Transitory and Dynamic Stability; 9) Provide Analysis of System Behavior in Cases of Major Incidents and Proposed Stabilization Solutions to Improve Dynamic Stability; 10) Recommendations for Developing a Defense Plan for the Network in Order to Compensate for Major Incidents (Site Losses, etc.), to Preserve Interconnections and to Avoid Network Crashes; 11) Development of a Restoration Plan for Interconnections; 12) Coordination of the Protection and Regulation Systems; 13) Evaluation of Investments Needed for Enhancements for the Different Periods (2004 and Beyond); 14) Profitability Study; 15) Define Active Power Exchange Limits During Normal Operations and in Incident Mode; 16)  Cost Evaluation of Losses for Different Periods and Difference Scenarios; 17) Evaluation of Reactive Energy Cost; 18) Estimation of the Cost of Access to the Network for Electrical Transmission; 19) Technical Management Procedures; and 20) Time-Phased Improvement Implementation Plan Covering all Technical and Management Items and Cost-Analyses

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $311,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of electric, water and wastewater infrastructure systems at the Fort Monmouth Army Installation, New Jersey.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s)will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
Fort Monmouth is a U. S. Army Installation located approximately fifty (50) miles south of New York City, New York.  Established in 1917, the Installation was initially designated Signal Corps Camp, Little Silver, before the name was changed to Camp Alfred Vail, in honor of the New Jersey inventor. In 1925, the Post was officially designated Fort Monmouth, in honor of the men who had died on the nearby Revolutionary War battlefield. Today, Fort Monmouth is home to the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, the Army Information Systems Management Activity, the Army Chaplain Center and School, the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School and the Joint Interoperability Engineering Organization. 
The Installation's population includes approximately 820 active duty military personnel, 6,110 civilian government employees, 3,500 permanent Government contractors and about 1,650 military dependents. Fort Monmouth covers an estimated 637 acres at the Main Post and 464 acres at the Charles Wood Area, located 1-1 ½ miles away.

ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Fort Monmouth currently purchases wholesale electric power from General Public Utilities Corporation (GPU) at two delivery points, East Substation located in the south-central portion of the Main Post and at a 34.5 kV metering station located in the Charles Wood Area. The existing electric distribution system consists of:
·	Four 34.5-4.16 kV distribution substations
·	One 12.47-4.16 kV distribution substation
·	Approximately 31.5 circuit miles of primary distribution line
·	1,000 street lights
·	734 building services.

East Substation supplies the main installation via an automatic throw-over switch connecting a bank of two 5000/6250 kVA, 3-phase transformers.  It is supplied from GPU’s 34.5 kV transmission line.  The 34.5 kV line terminates at a GPU owned and maintained substation located adjacent to the East Substation.  The GPU substation consists of one high voltage structure and one-oil circuit breaker located below the Army’s high voltage structure.  A third 5000/6250 kVA 34.5-4.16 kV power transformer with automatic load tap changer was installed in 1997 as a spare to allow one of the other transformers to be taken out of service for maintenance.  This third transformer is connected to the main switchgear via a tie breaker.  The transformer is kept energized, with no load, and could be utilized should a problem occur with the 3 MVA transformer or at the West Substation.
The transformer secondaries, 4160/2400 volts, are connected through a voltage regulator for each bank to a switchgear bus protected by two main circuit breakers equipped with seven breakers and a center tie breaker.  The voltage is then distributed to the Installation via aerial pole lines, except in the more recently constructed areas where a duct and manhole system is used.  The Army owns all the switchgear and distribution feeder lines throughout the Installation.
Most buildings in the Main Post are served at 208/120 volts three phase or 120/240 volts single phase with secondary service drops from pole-mounted transformers.  Larger buildings are served from pad-mounted transformers adjacent to the building or from transformers installed in vaults in the building.
A West Substation was constructed as part of a Corps of Engineers contract to provide power to the 1200 area buildings on the West Side of the Main Post.  This contract was completed in 1990.  This substation is fed from a 34.5 kV aerial transmission line originating from the East Main Post Substation.  The aerial line consists of three #350 MCM Aluminum conductors, fused at 400 amps, which traverse the Main Post to the 1200 area.  The West Substation, as constructed, consisted of a 7500 kVA, 4160/2400-volt load tap changing transformer with oil containment pit and a walk-in metal clad switchgear enclosure.  A 1200 amp protects the transformer primary, 35 kV oil circuit breaker.  There are eight outgoing feeders from the original switchgear.  Some buildings have dual feeder capability.  The distribution system is an underground system, comprised of concrete encased duct banks and manholes.  Splices in the manholes are performed with modular type splices, which offer quick sectionalizing in the event of system failure.
An addition to the West Substation was constructed as a part of a Corps of Engineers contract in 1994.  The addition consisted of another 7500 kVA 4160/2400 volt, load tap changing transformer with oil containment pit and walk-in type metal clad switchgear enclosure.  The transformer primary is protected by a 1200 amp, 35 kV, SF6 breaker.  A tie breaker was installed between the two switchgear sections, to facilitate maintenance to individual transformers and to pick up total load in the event of individual transformer failure.  The tie breaker is normally open during operation of the substation.
There are four outgoing feeders from the additional set of switchgear.  Some buildings have a dual feeder capability through the use of pad mounted sectionalizing switches.  The distribution system is an underground system, utilizing concrete encased duct banks and manholes.  The underground feeder consists of 350 MCM, XLP, 5 kV conductors.  The reuse of the existing duct bank and manhole system on the Avenue of Memories, which is the main avenue traversing the Main Post, enables Fort Monmouth to back feed the East Main Post Substation from the West Substation and vice versa, in the event of substation transformer failure.  The back feed can only accommodate 400 amps of additional load, so energy conservation measures would need to be taken and nonessential load sectionalizing performed in order to avoid overloading the feeders.  Both 7500 kVA transformers in the West Substation have tank mounted fans, which can increase their capacity to 10,500 kVA.
An additional 34.5 kV feeder was installed in 1995 to feed the housing quarters, Research Development and Administration buildings on the East Side of the Main Post.  This feeder also serves to alleviate the East Substation of overloads during the summer peak season.  This new feeder was tapped off the 34.5 kV feeder, supplying power to the West Substation.  The feeder consists of 3 #1/0, 35 kV conductors in a underground duct bank, feeding a 3 MVA 34.5-5 kV pad mounted transformer, with 400 amp, 5 kV pad mounted switchgear.  From the switchgear, a concrete encased underground duct bank carries the feeders to the area along Parkers Creek where the underground feeders switch to an aerial distribution through riser poles.  Primary service to buildings consists of underground primary conductors feeding pad mounted transformers.  Secondary services from the transformers to the buildings are comprised of underground conductors in duct banks.  In case of transformer failure in the 3 MVA Substation, an alternate feed can be provided from the East Substation feeder #4, through aerial switching.
Service to the Charles Wood Area, which is approximately 1 ½ miles west of the Main Post, is by way of an Army owned 34.5 -12.47 kV unit type substation.  The substation is served by a 34.5 kV transmission line, which originates at the 34.5 kV metering station located approximately 1,200 feet south of the substation.
The Charles Wood 34.5 kV metering station consists of 1200 amp, 34.5 kV indoor switchgear consisting of two feeder breakers and one non-automatic source breaker.
The Charles Wood Electrical Distribution system was upgraded from 5 kV to 12.5 kV distribution under a Corps of Engineers contract, completed in 1994.  The contract consisted of installing a 34.5-12.5 kV unit type substation with two 10/11.2/14 MVA 34.5-12.5 kV transformers and 12.5 kV metal enclosed, walk-in type distribution switchgear with vacuum type circuit breakers for the transformer feeders.  Two overhead and two underground 12.5 kV distribution feeders originate from this substation along with two underground 12.5 kV circuits that feed a 12.5-4.16 kV substation located adjacent to Building 2700.
The Building 2700 12.5 kV substation consists of two 7.5 MVA 12.5-5 kV transformers that are oil cooled and have provisions for future air-cooling.  With the present summer peak loading of Building 2700 being approximately 4000 kVA, one of the transformers can handle the load with the other being used as a backup, in the event of transformer failure or in the case transformer maintenance.
The aerial distribution system is fed from two feeders originating at the 12.5 kV Substation and consisting of 3 #2/0 copper conductors with neutral, which feeds office buildings and housing areas.  Service entrances to buildings consist of underground primary conductors, coming off riser poles and feeding pad mounted transformers with underground secondary service entrance conductors.  The Megill and Olmstead Housing areas have been converted to a URD type of electrical distribution system utilizing pad mounted transformers.  The Olmstead Housing area is fed from both feeders with one feeder being normally open through a sectionalizing switch.  In the event of primary feeder failure, the switch can be closed to enable the area to be energized from the alternate feeder.  The Howard Commons Housing area electrical distribution system consists of an aerial distribution system with underground service entrances to buildings.  Service entrances consist of main breaker equipped electrical metering gear with a meter for each quarters.  In case of Fort Monmouth primary feeder failure, the area can be backed by using the utility’s feeder, through aerial switching.

POTABLE WATER SYSTEM
Fort Monmouth currently redistributes the potable water purchased from NJAWC (New Jersey American Water Company) throughout the Main Post and Charles Wood areas via 178,760 linear feet (33.9 miles) of underground potable water distribution lines. Fort Monmouth's potable water system also includes one (1) elevated storage tank and one (1) ground storage tank. The ground storage tank is not service. The potable water distribution system transports potable water from the metered interconnections with NJAWC throughout the Main Post and Charles Wood utility service areas. The potable water mains are constructed primarily of asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). There are approximately 253 valves of various sizes and 251 fire hydrants distributed throughout the Main Post and Charles Wood utility service areas.

WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
Wastewater is collected from the Main Post and Charles Wood utility service areas via 121,360 linear feet (23.0 miles) of underground wastewater collection lines. The Installation's wastewater collection system also includes 547 manholes and nineteen wastewater life stations. The wastewater collected from the two utility service areas then flows to Northeast Monmouth County Regional Sewerage Authority (NEMCRSA) wastewater lift station where it is pumped to the Sewerage Authority's wastewater treatment plant. The majority of the collection system is terra cotta type clay pipe. The wastewater collection system was constructed for the most part from the 1930s to the 1990s.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of water and wastewater systems at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Natick, Massachusetts.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (SSC), Natick, Massachusetts is a compact military installation situated on approximately 78 acres located on the eastern shore of Lake Cochituate, approximately 17 miles west of Boston, adjacent to the Town of Natick, Massachusetts. The Center provides support to various DoD organizations conducting research, development and testing activities to assure acceptable equipment and technologies for U. S. Army personnel.

The Center includes six geographic areas, but only the main installation area, Kansas Street and Heritage Lane housing areas are included in this privatization action.

SSC’s physical plant at the main installation includes over 50 buildings or structures. In total, the main installation physical plant covers approximately 817,350 square feet (SF). Potable water and wastewater utility services are provided to 37 buildings covering 805,444 SF (99 percent).

Water Distribution System Description
The Center’s water distribution system includes both potable water and non-potable water distribution systems. Both systems are currently served off of the 10-inch water main, which interconnects with the Town of Natick’s (the Town) water main on the east side of the railroad tracks and runs along the northeastern boundary of the Installation. Water is delivered to the master metering point located within the metering and backflow station. The potable water system provides water for domestic and sanitary uses and the non-potable system provides water for fire-protection, make-up water for the boilers and cooling towers, lawn sprinkling, etc.

The Center’s potable water system includes the main installation’s metering and backflow station, roughly 11,900 linear feet of potable water mains ranging in size from less than 2-inches to 10-inches, and approximately 34 main valves ranging in size from 4-inches to 10-inches. Approximately 91 percent of the Center’s potable water requirements are purchased at the main installation metering point and distributed throughout most of the Center’s facilities. The remaining 9 percent of SSC’s potable water requirements are purchased and distributed throughout the Kansas Street and Heritage Lane housing areas and the Sentry Station. The Sentry Station meter is located inside the building, whereas the housing area meters are located in underground manholes.

The non-potable water system includes roughly 6,910 linear feet of water mains ranging in size from 4-inches to 10-inches, approximately 28 main valves ranging in size from 4-inches to 10-inches and approximately 18 fire hydrants. The non-potable water system extends from the “T”, which provides a connection from the potable water system to the non-potable lines throughout the Installation. SSC is in the process of completing a project which when completed will allow the Center to utilize the non-potable water discharged by Building No. 94 to offset water purchased from the Town.

Wastewater Collection System Description
The Center collects the wastewater from its facilities and conveys it to the Town of Natick for treatment and disposal by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). The Town of Natick bills the Center for the conveyance of the wastewater to MWRA’s treatment facility and MWRA’s treatment and disposal of the wastewater. In the event that the wastewater system is privatized, the Center’s wastewater discharge permit with the MWRA will need to be modified accordingly.

There is no wastewater treatment facilities owned or operated by SSC; however, SSC does operate a laboratory pretreatment wastewater system that removes mercury before the wastewater enters the wastewater collection system. The Center’s two laboratory pretreatment systems are located in Building Nos. 3 and 42. Even with the pretreatment systems, it is possible that some mercury has slipped past the pretreatment systems and has collected in the wastewater collection lines. The Government would retain the responsibility for the environmental remediation of the collection lines in the event that the wastewater collection system is privatized.

The Center’s wastewater collection system includes 5 exterior lift stations (Heritage Lane, Kansas Street, Bath House and Building Nos. 44 and 94), 3 oil/water separators (Building Nos. 77, 15 and 16), 2 exterior grease traps (Building Nos. 36 and 15), 63 manholes, and approximately 13,360 linear feet of sewer mains. The connection with the Town of Natick’s wastewater lines is located at the intersection of Kansas Street and N. Main Street (Route 27).

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation. Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The final design should achieve the following goals: Compatibility: The round must be compatible with a standard pump 12gauge shotgun such as the Remington 870; Lethality: The round must be non-lethal at ranges greater than 20 yards with a maximum allowed kinetic energy of 58 ft-lbs; Penetration / Payload Dispersal: The round must penetrate a s ingle-pane of glass at 50 yards.  It is desired that the round passes through the glass intact and then disperses the payload on contact with a body or drywall.  However, it is acceptable for the round to not pass through the glass intact, as long as the content of the round passes through in its entirety.  The ability for the round to penetrate a double-pane of glass would also be advantageous. Containment: The round must safely contain the OC/Malodorant payload without any detectable leakage for a projected minimum shelf life of at least 1 year.  The payload will be a liquid organic mixture of Oleoresin Capsicum (commonly referred to as OC or pepper spray), mercaptans, sulfides, and possibly some amines.  The payload formula will be a government furnished item.  The contractor is expected to mix the payload and fill the projectiles on site.  The contractor will provide to the  government the encapsulated payloads for leakage testing;  Accuracy:  The round must be able to impact a 2 foot wide by 3 foot tall target at a range of 50 yards.  In addition to design of the round, the contractor is to develop the fill methodology and procedures necessary to load the rounds with both the inert liquid payload and the OC/Malodorant.  All drawings, designs, and procedures developed will be government property.  Each proposal should provide a complete cost breakout providing the basis for the price.  Three current/verifiable references should be included in the proposal.  All items are to be priced FOB Destination. DOD will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database. Registration can be completed by accessing the CCR Web Site at http://www.ccr.gov. A paper registration form may be obtained from  the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at (800) 334-3414.

<DESC>1.	Throughout the AO, especially note Sections 1.1, 5.11.4, 5.12.8, 8.0, and Item 24 in Appendix G, the launch date requirement of “December 31, 2009,” is replaced with “June 30, 2010,” plus the following sentences:  “December 31, 2009, is considered the optimal “no-later-than” launch date.  However, proposed launch dates as late as June 30, 2010, if adequately justified, will not be judged non-compliant with the terms of this AO.”  2.	The following text should be added as the second paragraph in Appendix F:  “Proposed budget profiles that deviate as much as 15% per year (that is, in one or more funding years) from the profile provided below will not be judged non-compliant with the terms of this AO as long as the total cost cap of $360M is not exceeded.  However, the profile provided here is to be considered optimal, and justification of any deviations must be provided in the proposal.” 3.	The Fiscal Year 2008 value listed in the NASA New Start Inflation Index, Table B-3 on page B-22, should read “1.084” instead of “1.094.” 4.	The last sentence of Section 7.2.1 should be replaced with the following text:  “Evaluation findings for each criterion will be documented using narrative text in terms of specific Major and Minor Strengths and Weaknesses, as well as an adjectival summary score.	The adjectival summary scores will be reported as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor, as defined in the table below, for the first two criteria, and High Risk, Medium Risk, or Low Risk for the 3rd criterion.”

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing, as well as a change in the technical POC’s mailing address.  No other changes have been made.  Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. Jonathan C. Gregory, AFRL/IFEC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-4294, email:   Jonathan.Gregory@rl.af.mil.      Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Renee F. Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of information and sensor data analysis technology and associated sensors that will overcome deficiencies and enhance capabilities in existing and planned systems that support law enforcement and corrections efforts and the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center Northeast (NLECTC-NE.) The NLECTC-NE's mission is to work with government, industry, and academia to identify, evaluate, develop, demonstrate, and assess technology applications for law enforcement and corrections agencies. These efforts include, but are not limited to, concealed weapons detection, audio processing, video surveillance, facial recognition, timeline analysis, communications, communications and information systems interoperability, command and control, mobile and wireless computing, computer forensics, cyber crime, digital evidence handling, school safety, Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET), information management, and information storage, retrieval and exploitation. High level overviews of areas of interest for this BAA are in the following paragraphs.    Concealed Weapons Detection (CWD) using either active or passive sensors is a priority for military personnel performing peacekeeping missions, law enforcement officers, and security personnel. Of interest are low cost technologies that can provide portable concealed weapons detection to include weapons with little or no metal content and explosives. Technology which could perform this at a standoff distances of at least ten meters and/or operate autonomously for weapons screening is also of interest.  Also of interest are technologies to perform Through the Wall Surveillance (TWS) and Personnel Location and Tracking (PL&T).  This includes the ability to detect, track and identify moving and stationary targets through building materials and rubble in the case of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R).    Technology development may include those generate a floor plan from outside of a structure as well.  The development of audio processing technologies to allow speaker identification, elimination of noise and/or multiple voices, enhancement and identification of background noise. Video surveillance technologies and tools to enable the acquisition, processing, storage, and enhancement of video data to support law enforcement activities, e.g., facial recognition, identification of individuals, vehicles, events, and interactions.  Timeline analysis technologies to provide both pattern/trend analysis for investigations, and to enhance logistics and planned coverage of regions for increased effectiveness of law enforcement resources. Timeline analysis tools to allow the user multiple customizable ways to display location, time, interaction and event data.    Communications research, development and demonstration of voice and data communications for public safety applications. Communications support voice, data, and "broadband" data (such as real-time video, geographic/map data and overlays, etc.), and can be transmitted via landline, radio frequencies, and/or microwave frequencies, both clear and encrypted. Mobile and wireless computing to provide a local data processing capability giving those in the field users a more responsive and interactive data accessing environment.  Geographic information tools and technologies are increasingly important for law enforcement in coordinating the response of resource and in the analysis of data and discovery of trends/patterns. Geospatial systems integrated into communications networks would assist command and control capabilities by directing messages to those elements which where able to effectively respond. For example, it could increase efficiency by providing information to those who need it, while filtering irrelevant information.  Interoperability is a key element of law enforcement/public safety operations. It is the ability to share/disseminate information to those who need it without impediments created by differing systems, offices, or organizations. Research and analysis of interoperability issues are critical to address early on to provide roadmaps for development and implementation which reduces the conflicts experienced when interfacing with dissimilar systems.    Enhancement of communications systems is an area of interest in this BAA. Communications systems can include private land mobile radio (LMR) systems, commercial services, and/or specialized systems such as wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and satellite communications. Advanced technologies including, but not limited to, software defined radios, voice over IP (VoIP), wireless LAN, 3G wireless data, ultra wideband communications, and mesh networks have the potential to significantly enhance law enforcement and public safety communications; part of this effort is to accelerate the process of transferring these technologies to the law enforcement/public safety market.  Computer Forensics, Cyber-crime: Perform applied research and prototype development in the digital forensic sciences for mission time-critical needs of military and civilian operational networks with spin-offs for the statute-driven law enforcement approach. Explore and apply scientifically proven methods to gather, process, and interpret digital evidence to 1) describe cyber-attack activities, enabling post-attack critical information data and infrastructure restoration, 2) correlate, interpret, and predict adversarial actions and their impact on military operations, and 3) ensure digital data scenario evidence has provable integrity appropriate for military defensive and offensive operations and, possibly, criminal investigations.  Information storage, management, retrieval, and exploitation are technologies that law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice, and public safety agencies increasingly rely upon. The information must be maintained securely while still allowing timely access and updating by multiple agencies/organizations. These systems also need to go types beyond the traditional text based systems to encompass additional and new data types, e.g. audio, video, geospatial. These systems must be able to integrate into the modern computing/networked environment.   Assessments of state-of-the-art of the technologies above will be performed and provided for law enforcement and corrections agencies. Technology demonstrations/evaluations will be accomplished in a real world environment.  Best practices and lessons learned of those evaluations will be fed back to technology development programs and disseminated to the criminal justice community.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information. Contact the technical POC. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the “2002 Farm Bill”), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for “approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.” 

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to evaluate payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a request for information announcement—A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

Interested Parties must submit an expression of interest in  accordance with the instructions in this Synopsis: This solicitation is unrestricted and is open to all firms regardless of size.  Up to two contracts may be awarded from this solicitation.

The primary geographic extent of the assignments includes the Florida, Puerto Rico, U. S. Virgin Islands and the Caribbean area of the Jacksonville District.  Additionally, the contracts may be used to provide services within the geogr aphic boundaries of the South Atlantic Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.

PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services will include engineering and design services for civil works projects such as preparation of design reports, preparation of engineering studies, preparation of cost estimates in MCACES Gold format,  preparation of design calculations, and preparation of construction plans/specifications suitable for use in competitive bidding processes.  The work will encompass all types of civil works projects including environmental restoration; flood control; beac h renourishment and erosion control; jettys; navigation (including dredging); bridges; site plan development; paving, grading, and drainage plans; and utility systems design and relocation.

(Relevancy is defined in the DOD guide to collection and use of past performance as:  information that has a logical connection with the matter under consideration and applicable time span). Pertinent issues are ability to meet establishe d schedules, ability to accomplish work within budgetary limitations, and quality of the delivered product. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry regarding quality and timeliness of work will be reviewed. Past DOD expe rience data available to the Government through the A-E Contract Admi nistration Support System (ACASS) and information available from other sources, will be utilized for prior performance evaluation. 3. SIZE AND EXPERTISE OF STAFF: Firm must have, either in-house or through association with qualified subcontractors, U.S. re gistered personnel as follows: Architects, Engineers, and Landscape Architects. Engineering staff must include, but not be limited to, the following disciplines: Civil, Mechanical, Structural, Geotechnical, Coastal, Hydraulic, Hydrology, Soil, Sanitary, an d Electrical.

CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK IN THE REQUIRED TIME: Firm mus t have the capacity to commence work within fifteen days after receipt of notification to proceed with a task order and accomplish it in accordance with scheduled completion dates. THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS TIEBREAKERS, IF NECESSARY:   5. VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Work previously awarded to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified firms.  6.  GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF FIRM RELATIVE TO T HE WORKSITE: Location of the firm relative to the worksite (considered the Jacksonville District Office) will be considered provided there is an adequate number of qualified firms for consideration.

In Block 4 of SF 255 list only the office personnel for the office to perform the work which is indicated in Block 3B.  Additional personnel strengths, including consultants and subcontractors, should be indicated parenthetically, and their source clearly identified.

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before receiving a cont ract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov). Small and small disadvantaged firms are enco uraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and small d isadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.   If a large business firm is selected for award, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-1, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract, the Corps of Engineers target goals for subcontracting are 57.2% to small business concerns; 10.0% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 10.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 3.0% for SBA HUBZone certified small business concerns; and 3.0% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  Large firms should keep t hese target goals in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Senior Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>IDAHO NATIONAL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS CAPABLE OF COMMERCIALIZING ANTIVIRAL AGENTS DESIGNED FOR THE SELECTIVE DESTRUCTION OF CELLS INFECTED WITH HIV.     Announcement:     Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), operated by Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI) under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners capable of developing, implementing, and commercializing BBWI proprietary antiviral agents designed for the selective destruction of cells infected with HIV, and who are interested in entering into a license agreement, research and development agreement, or both, for the purpose of developing and commercializing antiviral agents designed for the selective destruction of cells infected with HIV for human therapeutic applications.     License terms would include an up-front licensing payment, minimum annual royalties and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  A research and development agreement would be under a standard CRADA arrangement with an option for licensing subject inventions.     Note:     THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY BBWI TO ENTER INTO EITHER A LICENSE AGREEMENT OR A COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITH ANY COMPANY.     A description of the technology follows:  Antiviral agents have been designed for the selective killing of cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  The agent is described in US Patent No. 6,627,197.  Briefly, the agents combine the lethal effect of the toxin “ricin,” with cell targeting and HIV-specific enzymatic activities to achieve its selective destruction capability.  Ricin is comprised of two polypeptide chains, A and B, linked together.  The A chain is the toxin.  The B chain facilitates cell binding and entry.  Ricin is non-toxic until the link between the A and B chains is cleaved.  After entering an infected cell the link is cleaved by an HIV-specific enzyme and the toxic A chain is released, killing the cell before it produces new viral particles.  By design, cells without the HIV-specific enzyme are not harmed.  This agent may enter both infected and uninfected cells.  Its selectivity comes from the presence of an HIV-specific protease enzyme.  If the enzyme is present, the cell is killed.  Many different targeting compounds can be used in various permutations of this antiviral agent.  More details will be available to qualified companies under a nondisclosure agreement.  The successful company will be expected to:  a) be capable of funding the development of the antiviral agents, b) have expertise in the development of antiviral agents involving toxins and, c) have the ability to commercialize the product of these developmental activities.  Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing BBWI's designs of antiviral agents for the selective destruction of cells infected with HIV should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following: 1) company name and address; 2) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address for a point of contact; 3) a brief description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology; and 4) a brief description of how the company might commercialize this technology.  The statement of interest should be made by US mail or e-mail and should be received within 30 days of publication of this opportunity at the following address: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Advisory Account Executive, Technology Outreach, BBWI, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805. E-mail is snydjr@inel.gov.

<DESC>Sources Sought:  The USCG ELC anticipates awarding a requirements type contract for the inspection, repair, testing and calibration of Woodward Governors: NSN 2990-01-329-8355 Diesel Engine Part Number 8571-584--  The calibration and set-up data is held as proprietary by the Fairbanks Morse. The USCG ELC does not possess the manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures, test specification or calibration set up data.  The Government intends to solicit only Fairbanks Morse and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U. S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specification along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Woodward, the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  It is also the belief of the Government that only Fairbanks Morse holds the proprietary calibration and set-up data.  The U. S. Coast Guard does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the overhaul capabilities of alternate or equal products.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Dobbins at the address indicated above.  It is intended to award a Requirements Type Contract with one (1) Base year and Four (4) option years.  Delivery shall be made to U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.  See Numbered Note  22.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to obtain through competition (if considered more economical) the services required to support Real Estate and Facility Management (REFM) Logistics Support functions for the Internal Revenue Service ten Campus Centers. The locations where the services will be performed includes the following geographical areas: Andover, MA; Atlanta & Chamblee, GA; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; Philadelphia, PA; Covington, KY; Holtsville, NY; Kansas City, MO; Ogden, UT; Martinsburg, WV; and Austin, TX. The core type of services to be provided will include warehouse management, point-to-point transportation, administrative mail handling and office machine repair services.   A Government Request for Proposals (RFP) is being developed to conduct a competition for the aforementioned commercial activities with a period of performance of a base year and four (4) one year option periods.  Reference to these services is not meant to be all-inclusive, but only meant to convey a reasonable idea of the types of services that will be included in the proposed study.   The Government is considering a firm-fixed price contract type with cost options.   The objective of this RFI is to obtain technical capability statements from interested parties capable of performing these functions by providing information on key staff experience, a description of corporate experience and a description of primary services provided to either the government or commercial customers, as well as the NAICS code(s) for the supplies/services. All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a technical capability statement of no more than ten pages to illustrate technical capabilities.  In addition to information provided by your technical capability statements, provide a total of five present and past performance references of similar contracts that have been completed in the past five years.  Reference should include a current point of contact with valid phone number for both contractual and technical disciplines, a brief statement of the scope of work, contract duration and the total dollar amount.  No page limit on present and past performance information.  Responders should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary.  Teaming arrangements, subcontracting and mentor protege programs are encouraged. Responses submitted will assist the Government in their market research in determining the availability of commercial sources and the acquisition strategy in terms of set-aside requirements.

<SUBJECT>D -- Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) for 2010 Census
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau is approaching two key milestones for the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS): a release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry on June 30, 2004 and a vendor conference on July 15, 2004.   The following includes: 1) Information about the draft RFP, including how to submit questions, and 2) what to do to attend the vendor conference.    

1) The U.S. Census Bureau will post a copy of the draft DRIS RFP, or minimally Sections B, C, F, J, L and M, on the following website (add the URL for the website) on June 30.You may submit questions or recommendations by email between July 1 and July 23, 2004.   Please email your questions to dscmo.2010.dris@census.gov.   We will post all questions anonymously on this website and include our responses.   All questions will be answered by August 20, 2004.   

2) The Census Bureau will host a vendor conference on July 15, 2004 on the upcoming DRIS acquisition. The agenda includes the following:

·	Overview of the acquisition as currently planned, 
·	Census Bureau's unique security issues and requirements, and 
·	Open forum for Q&A with Census Bureau DRIS subject matter experts.   

At the vendor conference you will also be able to get a copy of a paper test deck, dubbed the Digital Test Deck (DTD), that we created to demonstrate the expected complexity of paper data capture for the 2010 Census.  While the forms are in no way final, the Digital Test Deck (DTD) will be representative of possible 2010 Census form colors and will contain simulated data with computer-generated pen and pencil marks.  This test deck will only be available at the vendor conference, and only those who submit written requests for a copy of the test deck will be given one.  (Note: Copies must be requested in writing before the conference as described below.)   One set of the test deck forms is available per company.   

Please be sure to R.S.V.P. on behalf of your company and provide the names of each person attending from your company. Send the email to dscmo.2010.dris@census.gov or call 301.763.8439.  Also indicate on the email if you would like a copy of the DTD. Include DRIS RSVP in the subject line, and include your name(s), the company's name, your telephone number(s) and email(s) in the body of the message.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

AFIP performs screening and fo llow up testing for depleted uranium and other trace metals.  For the analysis we are using inductively couples plasma mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively couple plasma atomic emission spectrometry. All of the above techniques  use argon gas derived from high purity (99.997% Air) liquid argon tanks. Due to the quick evaporation of the gas, we can not maintain too many cylinders in the cage.  However, it is essential to have the argon gas available at all times which will result on the instrument to go down less times and thus increased analysis time. Please note that all gas delivery must be prompt and must have a quick response time (turn around time) of 4 days or less.  A government credit card (Visa) will be used to order the gas.   Therefore, the awardee must be able to accept the government credit card.

The pick ups and deliveries shall take place between the hours of 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM. AFIP will order minimum 2 tanks weekly not to exceed 7 tanks a month and no more than 80 tanks a year.   When the first initial order of the contract is placed, a Materiel Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) shall accompany the cylinders. The supplier must provide a certification of high purity with all tanks ordered. The cylinders/tanks size 160 is to be used for refilling.  Additional nozzles and markin gs are not required.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
Description/Specifications/Work Statement

A.	Background

In 1986, Presidential Executive Order 12564 required that each Federal Executive branch agency develop and implement programs to address drugs in their workplaces with a comprehensive program that would include a written policy, access to an employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to oversee the development of the Federal-wide program and help agencies with implementation efforts.  In addition, HHS was required to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service for business and industry that would answer their questions about drug use in the workplace.  The toll-free telephone service, which is the subject of this procurement, was initiated in 1987, and has continued uninterrupted since.  Under the Reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration on October 1, 1992, the administrative responsibility for managing this telephone consulting service was transferred to the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  In light of CSAP's prevention mission, the Workplace Helpline began to consult on alcohol issues and problems as well as drugs, and expanded its scope of coverage to include any community-based programs whose mission is to reduce or eliminate the problems of alcohol and drug abuse in their communities’ workplaces.

The Workplace Helpline responds to a critical need on the part of its largest constituent--small business.  As has been the case since its inception, the Workplace Helpline receives most of its requests for assistance from small business owners (i.e., employee populations of 250 or less) who represent the vast majority of enterprise in the American economy.  Small business also represents the segment least informed and least involved in addressing workplace alcohol and drug abuse problems.  The service is available to all 50 States and territories of the United States and has assisted employers from other countries.

B.	Objectives

The purpose of this requirement is procure the professional services of one full-time individual or two part-time individuals who have the appropriate knowledge and experience to continue the operation of the CSAP Workplace Helpline for a period not to exceed 12 months.  The one full-time individual or two part-time individuals will work a maximum total of 40 hours per week.  The Helpline individuals will normally operate the helpline from Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays).  Federal holidays include New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  The individual(s) can work their 8 hours between the flex hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time.  If two part-time individuals share operating the helpline, the two part-time individuals can split the 40 hours per week in any ratio.  Under no circumstances would the total hours exceed 40 hours per week.    


C.	Specific Requirements of CSAP

CSAP shall provide:

1. The Workplace Helpline 800 telephone number and local phone line and number;

2. A telephone messaging system;

3. Payment of all Workplace Helpline service telephone charges during the award period (CSAP will also be responsible for all repairs necessary for the phones and phone equipment);

4. An office with, at a minimum, a desk, chair, personal computer with appropriate software, and administrative support;

	5. A free parking space; and

6. All records, publications, materials, and information developed by the previous specialists in the performance of their helpline duties.


D.	Specific Requirements of the Helpline Individual(s)

Task 1.

The Helpline individual(s) answer telephone and email inquiries from businesses, industries, and community-based substance abuse prevention programs about alcohol and drug abuse and how to eliminate their use at work.

Task 2.

The Helpline individual(s) document each inquiry and describe the answer and information provided.


Task 3.

The Workplace individual(s) provide technical assistance on establishing comprehensive alcohol and drug-free workplace programs that include provisions for a written policy, employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing.

Task 4.

The Workplace individual(s) provide sources of publications, when requested by callers, that are pertinent to the issues presented by callers.

Task 5.

The Workplace individual(s) refer callers to other local and national resources for additional assistance when they are unable to provide the information (for example, other Federal or state agencies where relevant laws or regulations govern aspects of private or public workplace programs, community-based substance abuse prevention programs, legal assistance organizations, employee assistance programs).

Task 6.

The Workplace individual(s) provide in-person program consultation and training to businesses in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., at no cost to them.

Task 7.

The Workplace individual(s) conduct quarterly call-back evaluations to determine the percentage of callers to the Workplace Helpline that have taken action to develop some form of workplace substance abuse prevention initiative based on their contact with the Workplace Helpline. 

Delivery Schedule: 
Tasks/records shall be maintained in the office where the Workplace Helpline individuals work.  Records shall be monitored by the Government Project Officer. 
Payment Schedule:
Contractor shall invoice monthly for all hours worked with all backup timesheets attached. The invoice details shall state what period of time the invoice is covering (example: from November 1, 2003 through November 30, 2003); Job title  actual hours; billed hours; breakdown of each individual (Joe week 1, 2, 3, and 4 then Sammy week 1, 2, 3, and 4 etc.) and the hours per week that each has worked under this order.

<DESC>Response date for this solicitation is changed to 17 June 2004, 4:00 p.m.  The responses to questions regarding this solicitation are listed below.     
1.  NFPA 72 regulations require Plenum Rated Cable to be installed in drop ceilings; do you want all contractors to follow NFPA 72 guide lines?  Yes, all cable must comply with NFPA 72 guidelines.
 
2.  What record rate does the recorder need to meet (frames per second)?  No specific speed is required, whatever performs the best.  The Youth Center system has motion sensors that automatically adjust to record when movement is detected.
 
3.  Does the system need to be networked throughout the facility for remote viewing capabilities?  No.  Networking is not necessary throughout the building.  Only the offices need to have viewing capabilities for both buildings.
 
4.  Does the contractor need to be factory certified on the equipment they are proposing? 
No, the contractor does not need to be factory certified, but we will need to know what the repair capability and response time will be in case the equipment malfunctions.
 
5.  Does the contractor need to be located with in one (1) hour of the facility? 
No.  Next day service is satisfactory.  See next response
 
6.  Would you need 24 hour service?  No, 24 hour service is not necessary.  Next day service is satisfactory.  Staffing requirements increase significantly if the entire system is down, and schedules are disrupted if a room is unusable due to camera problems, so we can not afford lengthy downtime for any reason.
 
7.  Is there conduit connecting the two building?  Not currently.  Workers did arrive today to begin trenching and installing conduit between buildings.  
 
8.  Are the pre-existing cameras locations pre-wired or are there conduit already run to these locations?  The pre-existing camera locations are just conduit and junction boxes - ready for installers to pull cable as required.  As we said during the site visit you are not restricted to those locations.  We expect vendors to optimize camera locations and bring cable or power to those locations.
 
9.  Are there federal or military guidelines covering camera coverage's in the school?  If so, can we get access to theses guidelines?  No.  There are no specifics on camera coverage.  The Air Force Instructions just refers to complete coverage.
 
10. Could the base provide a design of the CCTV system so all bidders would be providing a proposal with the same amount of camera's, locations, recording time, out door night vision, pan and tilts with guard tour ability.  We believe the scope of work and equipment is so vague, McConnell may get a system design that is different with each company that provides a bid on this project.  No.  We have no expertise in surveillance systems.  We have tried to identify our requirements and expectations so that industry experts can design the best possible solution for our operation.  We expect to see different contractors address our requirement in different ways.  We will evaluate all submissions on their ability to provide total visual coverage of all areas, reliability, ease of operation by our staff, and best value for the Air Force.

11.  In the site visit the ladies running the school kept saying they wanted to be able to zoom in on possible persons causing trouble.  Not all cameras need to have zoom capability.  Only one camera in each of seven classrooms, one camera in the multi-purpose room, one camera outside the front door, and one of the playground cameras need zoom capability.  
 
12.  Does this mean they would like all cameras to have this capability or not?  If not then can the areas they want this capability be stated so we can spec the right equipment for the places they want?  You should identify which camera provides the best coverage in each area.
 
13.  Is zoning the cameras allowed?  (By zoning the cameras it would bring down the cost and work just as well) (You would just have two DVR's in your equipment cabinet instead of one.)  Yes, zoning is definitely an acceptable solution to our operational requirement.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
