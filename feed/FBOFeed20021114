<RESPDATE>112102
<ARCHDATE>12152002
<CONTACT>SUSAN BENIK, CONTRACTING OFFICER, FAX 703-787-1836
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-70684; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).   GovWorks, on behalf of USAID, intends to competitively award a contract to implement a portion of the Africa Education Initiative.  President George W. Bush announced this initiative on June 20, 2002.  The initiative stated, "Partner with historically black colleges and universities (HBCU's) in America to provide more textbooks and other learning tools for children in Africa."   This contract will provide 4.5 million textbooks and other learning tools such as teachers' manuals, CD ROM's, workbooks, etc. for children throughout sub-Saharan Africa in their national languages. Currently there are major education programs operating in Benin, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Malawi, Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia. Summarily, the Africa Education Initiative addresses the current state of education in Africa. Literacy and numeracy make a population more economically productive, allowing them to play an active role in governance and the emerging global economy. In sub-Saharan Africa, almost half of the primary school-aged children are not enrolled in school at all, and, of those who enter the first grade, fewer than 50 percent will complete the primary school cycle. Many of these primary school graduates, and their schoolmates who drop out, will not acquire the minimal levels of literacy and numeracy needed to progress to higher level of education or to benefit from the families' investments in their education. The overall weakness of the education sector threatens the economic growth rates and development Africa has been able to achieve. Through the textbook and learning materials program, USAID seeks to increase access to quality basic education for children, especially girls. A significant part of quality education includes having classroom materials available so teachers may reach students in effective and innovative ways. Textbook and learning materials will cater to various learning styles to help students learn. Some of the African countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Botswana (which has a regional focus) already have updated curricula in place. What these countries need is more copies of the textbooks made available. It is important that the colleges and universities have in-house printing capability for production of textbooks and learning materials. There are some countries, such at Benin, Guinea and Mali, in which textbooks will need to be developed based on what is already in use.  Colleges and universities need to address how Departments of Education, Foreign Languages, Political Science, Sociology, Mathematics, etc. will work together to produce textbooks and learning materials that are culturally and socially acceptable within the African context. A goal of this program is to build lasting relationships between American HBCU's and African universities so that the activities will be able to be carried own once USAID financial assistance is no longer available (sustainability).  The total estimated value of this effort is $6,000,000.00.  Contract Type: Time and materials.  Period of Performance:  Base Period - Two years, with three, one-year options. TECHNICAL PROPOSAL should address:  the breakdown, by year, of the number of textbooks they will be able to print and/or write and print to achieve the 4.5 million target within a five year period.  Address what pre-existing relationships they have with African institutions and governments, and federal sources from which they have previously received contracts/cooperative agreements/grants.  Consortia developed at the time of the proposal or to be developed shortly after the award of the contract are acceptable. Working with faculty at designated Africa universities (to be named by USAID after award) is an important part of the program.  Proposals should address how they will work with the universities to achieve the goal of the textbook and learning material activity, including whether centers of excellence will be established.  The technical should also include a monitoring and evaluation plan should be included.  The total length of the technical proposal should not exceed 25 pages (this includes all information from resumes to plans, etc.).   COST PROPOSAL: shall include all cost information for this effort to include all rates, other direct costs (ODC's), labor, etc.  The length is unlimited. EVALUATION CRITERIA -  Each Offeror's proposal is evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factors A, B, C, and D are in descending order of importance.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other.  Note:  Special consideration will be given to offerors that propose a Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's).   A.	Technical Approach 		1.	Understanding of the work, including creativity and thoroughness shown in planned execution of the project. 		2.	Discussion of specific methods and techniques for completing each discrete task. 		3.	Anticipation of potential problem areas, and creativity and feasibility of solutions to problems and future integration of new processes and technology enhancements. 		4.	Discussion of schedule (project timeline), proposed deliverables, and any other issues the Government should be aware of.  B.	Past Performance 		The organization's history of successful completion of projects with federal agencies and similar scope/magnitude; history of producing high-quality deliverables; history of staying on schedule and within budget, and effectiveness of cost control. C.	Key Personnel Qualifications 		The currency, quality and depth of experience of individual personnel in working on similar projects.  Similar projects are meant to convey similarity in topic, dollar value, duration, and complexity. D.	Organizational Experience 		The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number of projects, complexity, and dollar amount. Supporting subcontractors, consultants and partners will be considered. 		Appropriate mix and balance of education and training of team members. CONTRACT AWARD - Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.  Cost sharing for this program is encouraged. HOW TO RESPOND:  An original plus four (4) copies of both your technical and cost proposals are due November 21, 2002 by 3 PM ET to Procurement Operations, Mail Stop 2510, Second Floor, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA, 20170.

<RESPDATE>111802
<ARCHDATE>12182002
<CONTACT>Mark Melendez, 405-954-8071
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) intends to award a contract to the University of Oklahoma (OU) School of Industrial Engineering (IE).  This consulting services requirement will be processed under single source procedures to assist the FAALC in determining the ability to be able to stock the NSN’s at more than one site.  To that end, a detailed stock vulnerability engineering study is required to determine the NSN’s in FAA stock that are vulnerable to security/disaster issues.  The contract will be for one base tasking estimated at a cost of $37,000.00, and two optional taskings estimated at $30,000.00 each for a total estimated, firm fixed contract value of $97,000.00. <P> During the base tasking OU will further refine the critical NSN’s list.  If the Option 1 and Option 2 taskings are exercised by the Government, respectively they will work to reduce the number of critical NSN’s by exploring alternative sources of inventory, and (Option 2) create the detailed inventory, stock point, and cost recommendations/results required to implement the contractor findings. <P> This follow-on contracted action to the University of Oklahoma will be a continuation of the stock vulnerability conducted under DTFA-02-02-P-02897 that identified the number of processes and NSN’s impacted, along with identifying additional data requirements.  That stock vulnerability study served as the baseline for identifying the redundant NSN’s, providing roughly a 50% solution on a 100% scale, and the new study is intended to improve upon that solution roughly reaching 75 to 80% of the optimal.  A perfect 100% solution is unattainable due to time constraints, the large number of NSNs, and the complexity of the processes.   <P> Therefore, based upon the above, it has been determined that it would be cost and time prohibitive for a new contractor to attain the level of understanding and support that will be required under this contract.  In the final analysis the determination to single source with OU is based upon the need to maintain the continuity, and integrity for the specified services. <P> This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.  Point of contact is Mark Melendez, Contracting Officer, 405-954-8071, e-mail: mark.melendez@faa.gov <P>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT, N.E. METRO ATLANTA, GA.
This serves to provide notice that the U.S. Government intends to negotiate a sole source procurement for a lease of approximately 80,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (previously usable) square feet of space at Century Center Office Park for the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   The CDC recently took occupancy in a newly constructed building at this location.   Not all of the divisions of The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) would fit into the new building.  The Management Analysis and Services Office (MASO) also needs to be co-located with this organization as well as the CDC Bioterrorism function.   These Divisions interact on programmatic issues on a daily basis.   The close proximity of these two buildings is essential in maintaining the integrity of this programmactic interaction.    LEASE TERM: Approximately thirteen (13) years, eleven (11) months / eight (8) years, eleven (11) months firm.  This term would run coterminous with the newly constructed building at the office park.

<DESC>An Edwards Air Force Base Holiday Celebration will be held December 20, 2002 to bring the community together in celebrating the holiday season.  Many of our airmen and young families will not be able to return home for the holidays this year, and we hope to give them an uplifting celebration to chase away holiday homesickness.  We have planned a day of good old-fashioned merry-making and entertainment sure to bring a smile to even the most forlorn face.  So that you may share in this festive and worthwhile endeavor, Edwards AFB invites you to join in the spirit of the season and participate as a commercial sponsor. Sponsorship is an essential element for the continuation and success of programs such as this, and we are requesting your company?s support.  Sponsorship is contributed in the form of monetary and/or in-kind contributions. As a return on your investment, your company may receive unprecedented recognition in the form of audio, print and visual media coverage. Sponsor exposure, with varying sponsorship levels, may include name/logo recognition, brochures, media coverage, feature articles, photo opportunities, posters, and will be prominently acknowledged throughout the event.  All offers will be considered. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept offers for sponsorships from any contractor, including their affiliates (division, business groups, subsidiaries, etc.) subcontract arrangements, teaming partners and joint venture partners who are currently participating in, or who intend to participate in, any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), or will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,000 or more.  If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the Government.  More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered.  Requests for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than December 13, 2002.  This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non-appropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government.  It does not obligate appropriated funds of the government.  For more information or sponsorship opportunities, contact Marianne A. Seals at (661) 277-3802 or E-mail address: Marianne.Seals@edwards.af.mil

<DESC>The Division of Heart and Vascular Diseases (DHVD), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled "Pediatric Circulatory Support" for basic and applied research to develop novel circulatory assist devices or other bioengineered systems for infants and children with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease who experience cardiopulmonary failure and circulatory collapse.  This announcement is released under NAICS code 541710, for research and development contracts, size standard 500 employees.  The primary objective of the BAA is to develop novel circulatory assist devices including left and right ventricular assist devices, extracorporeal gas exchange systems, and other bioengineered systems for infants and children with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease.  Offerors are encouraged to propose basic physiological and bioengineering studies necessary for the design and evaluation of novel pediatric assist devices.  This may include pre-clinical and clinical studies that explore innovative strategies to meet the circulatory needs of the pediatric patient population.  Each offeror is expected to focus on overcoming the physiological and bioengineering hurdles that currently impede development of extracorporeal and implantable assist devices for infants and small children.  Systems must be, for example, appropriately sized, but capable of providing adequate cardiac output for the infant or child, while avoiding complications associated with the patient's small size, such as vascular injury or  thrombosis.  It is not anticipated that every offeror will propose a program that includes clinical testing within the five contract years, although each proposal should include the design and evaluation of devices with a clear potential for future clinical application.  The contractors will need to have considerable medical/scientific expertise in order to carry out the work to achieve the highly sophisticated research and technical objectives of this program, using biomedical staff including materials science and bioengineering, pediatric cardiologists and surgeons, and facilities involved in cardiovascular surgical treatment of infants and children.  This will be a best value acquisition based primarily on technical merit.  This is not a solicitation for contract proposals. It is anticipated that BAA NHLBI-BAA-HL-04-01 will be released on or about November 29, 2002, with notices of intent to submit a proposal due on or about March 21, 2003 and proposals due on or about  May 21, 2003.  The Government intends to negotiate four to eight contract awards for periods of five years each effective on or about February 15, 2004.  The solicitation will be posted on the NHLBI Home Page.  Access via the NIH Website (http://www.nih.gov).  At the NIH Home Page select "Grants and Funding Opportunites," then select "Research Contracts," from the listing select "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)."  Offerors with internet access may go directly to http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and search by BAA number or title.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FINANCIAL SERVICES This procurement is the first of several procurements that the Department of Energy will be initiating related to its competitive sourcing initiative announced on March 22, 2002.  The financial services function encompasses work performed by both Federal and contractor employees at 21 locations.  The financial services under this A-76 study consist of vendor payments, employee travel processing, billings and collections, financial systems support, general accounting, and financial reporting. DOE?s financial services functions are organizationally and geographically dispersed at the following locations: ? Three Financial Service Centers located in Germantown, MD, Albuquerque, NM, and Oak Ridge, TN; ? Sixteen DOE field offices (called ?satellites? because they process their financial transactions to the Financial Service Centers); ? Office of Financial Control and Reporting (FCR) located in Germantown, MD; and ? Office of Corporate Financial Systems (CFS), also in Germantown, MD. The current financial services organizational structure is the result of a consolidation and streamlining initiative that took place from 1995 to 1998. At that time three Financial Service Centers were established, the Department eliminated 16 different hardware platforms and 16 different instances of the Department?s accounting system, and substantial standardization of processes occurred.  It is envisioned that further consolidation will be achieved through this competitive sourcing initiative. The Department currently operates an in-house developed accounting system, Departmental Integrated Standardized Core Accounting System (DISCAS). DISCAS is a twenty year old system which is COBOL based and runs on a Hewlett Packard platform.  The Department has purchased new hardware and ORACLE software to replace the legacy system.  The current timeline provides that the system will be operational October 1, 2004.  Due to the current budgetary situation, it is possible that this schedule may be delayed.  Prospective bidders should be prepared to operate the Department?s legacy system, DISCAS, and transition to the new ORACLE system, when the Oracle system becomes operational. The Department?s Oak Ridge Operations Office intends to compete this requirement under solicitation number DE-RP05-03OR22963.  The acquisition approach has not been finalized at this time. The first step in this procurement process will be the release of an initial draft statement of work, which the Oak Ridge Operations Office intends to make available for public comment on November 15, 2002.  This draft does not include workload data which is currently being gathered and will be provided once it is compiled.  Comments should be e-mailed to: A76seb@oro.doe.gov.  Comments must be received by December 13, 2002.  Questions may be referred to Jeff Burgan, Contracting Officer at (865) 241-2513. Additional information regarding this procurement will be made available at the following website:  http://www.oro.doe.gov/a76/.

<CONTACT>DAN M. NEUSTEDTER, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: (919) 541-4749, E-Mail: neustedter.dan@epa.gov
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking a contractor to continue the operating of the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) which is an existing network of air monitoring stations that collect data for determining the deposition of dry acid precipitation.  Currently, CASTNet consists of approximately 82 monitoring stations operating across the U.S. with EPA sponsoring 54 of the stations.  The remaining 28 stations are operated by the National Park Service (NPS).  The contractor will be required to operate and maintain the fifty-four (54) EPA sponsored sites, as well as two (2) EPA sponsored sites which are collocated in areas covered by the NPS.  The contractor shall be responsible for all aspects of operation and maintenance of the network including arranging for site use and providing operators to service samplers, sample analyses, and data transmission for these 56 sites. For the twenty-eight (28) NPS sponsored sites, the Contractor will only be required to analyze samples and manage collected data.  The Contractor shall also be required to expand the network by adding new sites.  It is estimated that 15 additional sites will be added to the network over the next five years.  The current network operation involves collection of samples by drawing air through a filter pack, the use of continuous ozone monitors, and an array of meteorological equipment.  Each site is characterized by land use, leaf area, and other vegetation factors.  The contractor will procure, test, prepare, package, track, and ship sampling media to each site.  The contractor will also be responsible for receiving, storing, extracting, chemically analyzing, and archiving samples.   Quality control procedures shall be applied by the contractor to field, laboratory, and data collection operations as confirmed by the contractor's quality control program.  Data from field sampling, operator's observations,  calibrations, and quality assurance checks is to be collected, validated, analyzed/interpreted, stored, summarized, and delivered by the contractor in a report to EPA.  Network documentation related to procurement, testing, site selection, installation, initiation, field operations, sample analysis, data management, quality assurance, training, and any other documentation of existing activities must be prepared, maintained, and updated by the contractor as necessary.  Expansion of the network will involve site selection, assurances that site selection requirements are met, and establishing new CASTNet monitoring stations in remote areas of the U.S. It is anticipated that the issuance of RFP No. PR-NC-03-10014 for this effort will take place between mid to late December 2002 and early to mid January 2003 as full and open competition.  NAICS 541620 applies ; size standard is $6 million in average annual sales over the last three years.  The resulting contract is expected to have a twelve (12) month base period of performance with four (4) 12 month optional periods of performance.  For each twelve (12) month period of performance, there will be a base program consisting of  the operation and maintenance of the currently operational sites sponsored by EPA.  In addition to this base program, there will be Options A and B to address network expansion requirements.  Option A will cover the addition of a site to the network without any assistance from state of local agencies/institutions in the selected site area. Option B will cover the addition of a site to the network with assistance from state or local agencies/institutions in the selected site area.  EPA anticipates the award of a single contract consisting of:  i) a cost plus fixed fee completion component covering the base program as well as Options A and B; ii) a fixed price component to cover sample analyses requirements; and iii) a cost plus fixed fee level of effort component to address non-routine activities or special studies associated with CASTNet.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract number 68D98112 with Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc. which will expire on July 29, 2003.  The solicitation and amendments will be available via the Internet World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place : Ms. Zhang Yuzhen, Director General, Foreign Affairs Office, PetroChina Company Limited, World Tower, 16 Andelu, Beijing 100011, CHINA, Phone: (86-10) 8488-6012, Fax: (86-10) 8488-6014  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal UNDERGROUND GAS STORGAGE PROJECT IN THE PEOPLE?S REPUBLIC OF CHINA data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for assessing the development of an underground gas storage facility in the Jintan Salt Mine in the Changjiang Delta of Jiangsu Province, China.

In recent years, China has focused its energy needs away from coal and toward natural gas.  At present, gas makes up 3% of the energy consumed in China, but by 2010 the Chinese government hopes that the figure will be as high as 10 percent.  Four Chinese gas-producing basins, all located in the middle and western regions of China, contain over 70% of the country?s gas resources.  But the main market for this gas is located on the East coast.  Though producing gas now, these fields will not be able to meet the demand for gas until approximately 2015.  Until then, it is expected that China will need to import natural gas from central Asia and Russia.  To help meet the demand and facilitate distribution, PetroChina is building four trunk pipelines to complete its network and bring gas to the East coast.  In order to manage the peak and cyclic load operations of the West-East Pipeline and the other pipelines, a number of underground storage facilities will be required.

	The initial function of underground gas storage is to balance gas consumption and resources at all times (seasonal, daily and hourly fluctuations). Storage reservoirs also provide many more services such as a safety role and grid optimization.  In addition to these traditional functions, new services are emerging and underground gas storage facilities offer commercial possibilities (price hedging, better terms on import contracts, and export of storage capacity).  There are a number of advantages to storing gas underground, including the sheer size and volume of storage that underground facilities can manage, the low cost relative to the cost of above ground facilities, and the relative safety.  

	In order to enable the development of a regional gas distribution network, a large gas storage facility is required.  In the past, PetroChina has converted two depleted gas reservoirs into underground gas storage facilities.  The proposed project in the Changjiang delta will be the first constructed in a salt cavern and will require substantial foreign assistance and equipment.  Installations built in salt cavities are generally operated to cover peak demand.  They offer the advantage of productivity per well that is two to four times high than that of conventional facilities.  These salt caverns can be mined to varying shapes and sizes in order to accommodate specific storage requirements.  The shape and size of the caverns for this project will be determined in the feasibility study. A background Definitional Mission is provided for reference in Annex 2.

The aim of the Feasibility Study is to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of using the Jintan salt deposits for underground gas storage.

<DESC>On behalf of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, TASC Acquisition Services intends to award a purchase order to Global Insight of Washington, DC on the basis of other than full and open competition. Global Insight is the only known source that will meet the needs of the agency for Economic, Freight Car and Commercial Truck Services because of the following reasons:  The service provides a review of the prospects for economic activity in North America including the key macroeconomic influences that affect demand.  The underlying economic assumptions that drive the forecasts in the Global Insight's Freight Car and Commercial Truck Services are those utilized for other major work in the Department of Transportation, including the Multi-Modal Freight Analysis Framework Study conducted by Federal Highway Administration.  This service from Global Insight also contains significant information needed by the staff of FRA related to projections of major commodity haulings and intermodal traffic for U.S. and Canadian railroads over a five-year forecast interval.  Thus, from a policy perspective, Bureau of Transportation Statistics? analysis is more credible because of the consistency with regard to general economic assumptions used throughout the Department. This is not a solicitation.  Feedback may be submitted to the point of contact indicated above.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate with V-Soft Inc, 110 Foot of St 
John St, Lowell, MA 01852on a sole source basis for maintenance on software and hardware described below. This is to be done under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a Single Source. The maintenance shall be for 12 months.  The place of performance is the Mid Atlantic Program Center in Philadelphia, PA.  SSA is currently using a remittance processing system that includes an integrated system of hardware (Scanner, servers, and workstations) that were configured into a network, and supported by multi-function software developed by Vsoft Corporation.  The Vsoft CHEX Remittance Image system Software is the original COTS product, which has since been significantly customized by Vsoft to meet the needs of SSA.  Vsoft is the only firm known capable of performing the software maintenance work being sought under this contract, because of their inherent knowledge of the customized software. Additionally, maintenance is needed on the following hardware:  HPC Laser jet 8000 DN Printer, 24 ppm (qty: one); Unisys NDP 250 transport scanner, (qty:two).  While other firms have been contacted about maintaining this hardware as part of this system, only Vsoft has indicated a willingness to provide the support for the hardware used by this system.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is NOT available.  Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored. No other source is known to the Government that is capable of supplying this maintenance to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information received. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Kathy Fain at the telephone number identified above.

Gescan Publishing Inc., has been determined as the only responsible source based on the circumstances of the current maintenance agreement.  See Note 22

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Specifically include an assessment of the feasibility of outsourcing Federal RIK marketing functions, address implementation and operational costs and benefits, and evaluate overall impacts on in kind royalty revenues."  The total cubic feet cited in section "DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT MATTER ISSUES" is now corrected from "(380,000 MMBtu/day)" to "(350,000 Mcf/day)".  In addition, the date for receipt of the written portion of the proposal is now changed from December 3, 2002, to December 9, 2002, and the date for oral presentations is now changed from the week of December 9, 2002, to the week of December 16, 2002. THE DUE DATE FOR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS REMAINS UNCHANGED AT NOVEMBER 22, 2002.  HERE IS THE CORRECTED NOTICE IN ITS ENTIRETY:  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation, and is a request for proposals (RFP). The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract to assist in the continuing development of a top-tier professional organization within MMS responsible for managing activities associated with commodity sales and/or exchanges of royalty crude oil and natural gas. Contract work includes assessments of and recommendations on operational and technical issues and development of a 5-year Business Plan. The program of interest is MMS' royalty in kind (RIK) program, in which oil and gas production royalties are taken in kind as physical commodities delivered to the federal government by producers, as distinct from the historically prevalent payment of royalties by producers in cash. MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE STRUCTURE. The mission of MMS is managing the mineral resources on the outer continental shelf in an environmentally sound manner and to timely collect, verify, and distribute mineral revenues from Federal and Indian lands. The organizational components of MMS are described as follows. Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) provides management, policy, and direction for all minerals revenue management processes to ensure the efficient, timely, and accurate collection and disbursement of mineral leasing revenue due to American Indian Trust Tribes, individual Indian lessors, States, and the U.S. Treasury. The RIK program is currently administered by MRM. Administration and Budget (A&B) provides management, policy, and direction of the information technology, personnel, procurement, administrative support, budgetary, and financial management processes to support the bureau's program offices and other federal activities. A&B provides contracting, budgetary, and financial management support to the RIK program. Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) provides management, policy, and direction for all offshore oil, gas, and mineral lease, production, and inspection activities to ensure an effective economic return and a safe environment that balances the interests of the nation's economic welfare and a partnership with the industry. OMM provides data access and verification support to the RIK program. Policy and Management Improvement (PMI) provides policy review, special studies, and coordinated program and policy positions for the Director; manages the strategic planning process; oversees the regulatory and information collection programs; provides policy analysis; and manages the MMS appeals process. PMI provides analytic support for the RIK program. DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT MATTER ISSUES. The MMS has managed energy commodity sales "pilot" programs for 3 years, and a Small Refiner Program for several decades. Commercial projects include oil sales from Wyoming production (4,000 barrels/day); gas sales from Gulf of Mexico offshore production (350,000 Mcf/day); and oil sales to small refiners from Gulf of Mexico and Pacific offshore production (55,000 barrels/day). In addition, MMS and DOE manage the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) fill initiative through exchange agreements involving up to 130,000 barrels/day of Gulf of Mexico royalty oil. Some 1,100 Federal oil and gas leases are involved, with RIK commodities valued at well over $1 billion annually. The current primary RIK organization, the RIK Program Office, is headquartered in MRM's Lakewood Colorado office, with a Senior Executive Service Assistant Program Director reporting to the Washington, D.C. based Associate Director for MRM, and managing approximately 34 employees. The RIK Program Office performs the front office and mid office functions of the RIK program. The back office functions are performed by the Onshore and Offshore Compliance and Asset Management offices in Lakewood, CO, Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA. Financial accounting for RIK business activities is provided by MRM's Financial Management organization located in Lakewood, CO. Contractors are not currently used for operational functions, although Accenture LLP provides system-related development and support. The RIK Program Office has responsibility and accountability for the RIK enterprise, including selection and conversion of RIK properties, marketing and sales, contracting, crude oil and natural gas volume control, invoicing and payment, payables management, performance evaluation and management reporting. Payments are integrated with and flow through the overall MRM financial management system. Reconciliation of volumes taken to those entitled to be taken is performed by the compliance offices, which also monitor payment compliance with contract terms. The MRM RIK Office has successfully built the new RIK business enterprise and has expanded the RIK portfolio. Roles are functionally aligned with proven industry best practices. RIK personnel identify and evaluate business cases, perform economic analyses, conduct competitive sales, schedule product deliveries, and verify receipts. Business processes have been implemented and assigned personnel are effectively performing commercial commodity sales activities. Based on the RIK pilot programs' success, MMS concluded in its January 2001 RIK Road Map to the Future that RIK will be a permanent method to use, along with the traditional cash royalty approach, to manage the public's mineral royalty asset stream. The Road Map set forth the strategic direction and specific actions to develop core business processes, organization, and supporting technology to move the RIK program from pilot to operational status by the end of 2003. However, the strategic direction and implementation actions provided by the Road Map do not extend beyond 2003. Moreover, a recent internal MMS RIK needs assessment concluded that additional capabilities and resources will be needed to support a permanent RIK program of significant scale and that some operational areas may need to be outsourced. The needs assessment also concluded that technical assistance is needed for optimizing the RIK business model and associated strategies. Based on the foregoing, MMS believes it is timely and desirable to obtain expert advice on how to improve and expand the permanent RIK program. MMS is also proposing the development of a 5-year Business Plan to guide the administration and expansion of the Federal RIK Program in the future. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE CONTRACT. An independent assessment of current RIK program capabilities and performance, recommendations to improve overall program performance, and development of a 5-year RIK Business Plan. Specific deliverables follow: 1. Assess the current capabilities and performance of the Federal RIK Program and provide recommendations for improvement. a. Evaluate effectiveness of the current RIK business model and operational processes and recommend areas for improvement. Include in the evaluation a review of the crude oil marketing practices of the Canadian Province of Alberta and identify any procedures or practices with potential to improve the Federal RIK Program. b.

ADAPTIVE AND REFLECTIVE MIDDLEWARE SYSTEMS (ARMS),
SOL BAA 02-24, DUE:  10/31/03; POC:  DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161

PROGRAM SCOPE

The objective of the ARMS program is to create technologies and tools that will dramatically simplify distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware development, optimization, validation, and DoD combat systems. The middleware technologies and tools created in the ARMS program will focus on the challenging problems and risks associated with the development of a Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) in the DD(X) Future Surface Combatant Family of Ships.  The TSCE will be a fully integrated open system computing and information architecture that executes all tasks and mission applications optimized at the platform level, rather than the sub-system level, thus breaking down the traditional C4ISR, Combat Systems, and Ship Control System boundaries.  ARMS technologies and tools will allow researchers and DD(X) system integrators to develop and evolve complex DRE combat systems assuredly, adaptively, and affordably by:
-Supporting dynamic allocation and migration of DRE applications with their associated security level across a wide array of general-purpose computing resources to maximize survivability and mission availability in the face of equipment failure, battle damage, software failures, and information warfare attacks 
-Standardizing COTS at the middleware level (rather than just at lower hardware/networks/OS levels)  
-Devising meta-programmable DRE framework techniques and optimizations, as well as secure multi-level distributed dynamic resource management protocols/services for adaptive and reflective middleware that will enable DoD DRE systems to customize standard COTS interfaces, without the performance and flexibility penalties incurred by conventional COTS implementations and
-Building middleware services that enable applications to be independent of the particular resource management protocols, security policies, and fault tolerant mechanisms required.

For this BAA, there are two proposal categories, "Technology Developer" and "OEP Developer".  An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category, however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the ARMS program with specific challenge problems that describe the current operational state in the TSCE domain and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that will enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP Developer will integrate ARMS technologies into the TSCE testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs).

The OEP Developer will be the liaison between the TDs and the DD(X) Design Agent, and is responsible for conveying the DD(X) requirements, risks, complex computing system problems and other development needs to the TDs and for ensuring the TDs are addressing these needs. The OEP Developer will establish an Integrated Data Environment (IDE). This IDE will allow DARPA, the DD(X) Program Office, DD(X) Design Agent, and other DARPA approved Government laboratories remote digital access to ARMS Program documentation, software, and other developed technologies to facilitate the open communication and transition of information and technologies to the DD(X) Design Agent.

A primary emphasis of the OEP Developer experimental evaluation is the Quality of Service (QoS) of the ARMS DRE middleware. In that capacity, the ARMS OEP Developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the ARMS DRE middleware and representative TSCE applications in terms of their latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, security, and static/dynamic reflective optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, applications, and the integrated testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the ARMS program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category must propose a software test platform consistent with the TSCE concept described in the ARMS Program Background section, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate ARMS tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for ARMS experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that at most two OEP proposals will be selected for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.  Meta-programmable DRE Middleware Frameworks

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, framework technologies, and tools for applying meta-programming techniques to DRE middleware and applications. Meta-programming involves policies and mechanisms that systematically decouple the functional path of an application from its various cross-cutting QoS properties and resources by decomposing the system into:
?	Base-components, which implement certain application functionality (such as sensor processing, tracking, and weapons release/control) and
?	Meta-components, which abstract key QoS properties (such as persistence, concurrency, scheduling priorities, atomicity, ordering, state, replication, and change notifications) from base-objects and control many aspects of their behavior adaptively and reflectively at run-time. 

Proposers of new meta-programmable DRE frameworks should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to  DoD combat system developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time QoS goals, cross-cutting aspects (such as security, predictability, and dependability), and open middleware standards.  Proposers should focus on demonstrating their expertise in the context of concrete DRE middleware for DoD combat systems.  Proposers must show how they can interface their frameworks with other ARMS components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all meta-programmable DRE frameworks must be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards ARMS is developing and leveraging.  Frameworks developed for ARMS will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other frameworks and with standards-based meta-programmable middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Proposals for meta-programmable DRE middleware frameworks should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture, identify policies (explicitly or implicitly) on how data and resources it owns are used, document external and internal dependencies/constraints imposed, as well as rational of proposed middleware architecture and the process via which other ARMS Technology and OEP Developers will integrate their technologies with it.  The product of projects in this area should be capable of being transitioned to the middleware software market in the form of open protocols and interface standards.  Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG or The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for DRE middleware interoperability.

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.  Secure Multi-level Distributed Resource Management

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop and evaluate a new generation of DRE middleware that can manage system resources adaptively and reflectively across multiple security levels of distributed systems in real-time. The goal of this task is to substantially improve the ability of middleware to enable applications and users to reason about and manage resources dynamically and dependably within multiple levels (i.e., networks, operating systems, and several layers of middleware) of complex DRE systems. The results will allow applications and users better control over these complex systems by (1) deferring the commitment of many resources from design-time until run-time, without sacrificing overall system predictability and dependability and (2) allowing higher-level mission doctrine to determine tradeoffs between resource allocation and reallocation strategies, thereby enhancing overall system effectiveness, verifiability, and lethality.

Proposals for secure multi-level distributed resource management should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture, identify policies (explicitly or implicitly) on how data and resources it owns are used, document external and internal dependencies/constraints imposed, as well as rational of proposed middleware architecture and the process via which ARMS will integrate technologies with it.  Proposers in this area should demonstrate expertise in integrating meta-programmable DRE middleware frameworks with secure multi-level distributed resource management capabilities to form a coherent development tool suite suitable for the needs of the TSCE.  The product of projects in this area should be capable of being transitioned to the middleware software market in the form of open protocols and interface standards.  Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG or The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for DRE middleware interoperability.

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

For each Category: Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.

The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than three years in duration, with demonstrable goals that can be evaluated empirically at the midway point (18 months).  Offerors in both categories, OEP and TD, must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that will enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.

Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.

PROGRAM COMPOSITION OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (PCES),
SOL BAA 02-25, DUE:  10/30/02; POC:  DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161	

PROGRAM SCOPE

The objective of the Program Composition for Embedded Systems (PCES) is to create new language and compiler technology for developing distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware and applications that reduces complexity by separating application functional concerns (such as exploitation algorithms, rules of engagement processing, or weapons targeting) from cross-cutting systemic concerns (such as synchronization of concurrent operations, processor fault isolation, sensor input and actuator output timing constraints, distribution, and safe/efficient cache, register, and memory management).  The Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter/Weapons (SDMS/W) kill chain used to prosecute Time Critical Targets (TCTs) is an excellent example of DRE systems and their need for highly flexible, dependable, and efficient software.  The kill chain refers to the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) process used by an Air Operations Center (AOC) to commit strike resources against a TCT.  All of these operations must be accomplished within a short time window to destroy elusive mobile targets.  Since attack maneuvering and the weapon alignment and fly out consume most of the time interval, the actual strike decision must be made by the legal authorities and relayed to the pilot and/or weapon within seconds of combat identification of the target.  

The PCES program addresses the following factors that have historically increased software fragility and total ownership costs and imperiled the success of numerous new and planned DoD programs:
1.	Multiple platform and varying operational contexts. DoD systems must invest an ever-increasing proportion of functionality in DRE software to retain technological dominance. Rapidly emerging technologies and flexibility required for diverse operational contexts force deployment of multiple versions of software on various platform architectures, while preserving key properties, such as secure, dependable, and real-time response.  
2.	Total ownership costs. Software development and evolution is labor-intensive and error-prone for complex DoD DRE systems and can represent over 50% of the total ownership costs of these systems.    
3.	Obsolescence trends. Incommensurate lifetimes between DoD systems (20 years or more) and computational platform (2-5 years) lead to pervasive software obsolescence and multiply the total ownership costs by requiring periodic software re-development and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) refresh.    

This BAA solicits proposals in two research categories, "Open Experimentation Platform (OEP) Developer" and "Technology Developer."  Offerors in both categories must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the PCES program with specific challenge problems that must describe the current operational state in the domain of Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter (SDMS/W) systems, and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that would enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP developer will also integrate PCES technologies into the SDMS/W testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs). 

The primary emphasis of this experimental evaluation is the quality (both at design time and at run-time) of the PCES DRE middleware. In that capacity, the OEP developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the PCES DRE middleware and representative SDMS/W applications in terms of their flexibility, correctness, latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, and optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, SDMS/W applications, and the integrated SDMS/W testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the PCES program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category should propose a SDMS/W software test platform of interest to the Armed Services, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate PCES tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the SDMS/W constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for PCES experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that no more than one proposal will be selected in this area for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the SDMS/W testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.	  DRE Middleware Generation and Optimization Tools

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop languages, algorithms, patterns, and code bases to support the generation and optimization of DRE middleware that can be customized for specific mission requirements and constraints of DoD SDMS/W systems and applications. The middleware will be generated automatically and optimized via algorithms that can be tailored declaratively to adapt to key DRE platform characteristics, e.g., interconnection mechanisms, event demultiplexing mechanisms, I/O mechanisms, synchronization and concurrency mechanisms, failure detection and recovery mechanisms, configuration mechanisms, and power levels. Automating the configuration and optimization of DRE middleware is essential since the need for stringent behavioral assurance makes verification and empirical validation of the customized middleware components necessary. Moreover, these capabilities will ensure that DoD systems can leverage standards-based COTS while simultaneously ensuring that key protocol, implementation, and QoS properties can remain unique in order to retain superiority over adversaries who have access to the same standards-based COTS middleware.

Proposers of new DRE middleware generation and optimization tools should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to DRE developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time performance goals, cross-cutting aspects, and/or open middleware standards.  Proposals should discuss the importance and prevalence of these features in the context of DRE middleware and SDMS/W systems.  Proposers should also be able to interface to other PCES components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all DRE middleware generation and optimization tools will be required to be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards PCES is developing and leveraging.  Tools developed for PCES will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other tools and with standards-based middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Any number of different tools may be proposed in a given proposal, though each proposal must comply with all submission requirements including page limits given in this PIP.  Each DRE middleware generation and optimization tool proposed should be structured as a unique, separately priced task option so that a subset of those tools proposed might be targeted for funding. One or more tool options may be targeted for funding from a given proposal, though it is anticipated that no more than four DRE middleware generation and optimization proposals will be selected for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.	Distributed Quality Aspects

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, technology, and tools for applying aspect-oriented techniques to DRE middleware and applications.  In particular, DARPA is seeking innovative techniques that can collect, organize, and disseminate QoS-related meta-information needed to (1) monitor and manage how well the functional interactions occur in SDMS/W systems and (2) enable the decision-making needed to support systemic QoS properties robustly in the face of rapidly changing SDMS/W mission requirements and environmental conditions. These middleware capabilities are crucial to ensure that the aggregate behavior of complex network-centric SDMS/W systems is dependable, despite local failures, transient overloads, and dynamic functional or QoS reconfigurations.

Proposals for distributed quality aspects should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture and the process via which PCES will integrate technologies with it. To promote a common technology base, the interfaces and (where appropriate) the protocols used by PCES middleware should be based on (or should guide) established or emerging industry or DoD standards that are relevant for DoD DRE systems. However, the aspect-oriented technologies developed in the PCES program should also be customizable?statically and dynamically?for specific DoD DRE application and mission requirements. Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG and The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for PCES middleware interoperability. 

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.
 
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration. This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA?s release.

The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS)for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

<DESC>PROGRAM COMPOSITION OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (PCES),
SOL BAA 02-25, DUE:  10/31/02; POC:  DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161	

PROGRAM SCOPE

The objective of the Program Composition for Embedded Systems (PCES) is to create new language and compiler technology for developing distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware and applications that reduces complexity by separating application functional concerns (such as exploitation algorithms, rules of engagement processing, or weapons targeting) from cross-cutting systemic concerns (such as synchronization of concurrent operations, processor fault isolation, sensor input and actuator output timing constraints, distribution, and safe/efficient cache, register, and memory management).  The Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter/Weapons (SDMS/W) kill chain used to prosecute Time Critical Targets (TCTs) is an excellent example of DRE systems and their need for highly flexible, dependable, and efficient software.  The kill chain refers to the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) process used by an Air Operations Center (AOC) to commit strike resources against a TCT.  All of these operations must be accomplished within a short time window to destroy elusive mobile targets.  Since attack maneuvering and the weapon alignment and fly out consume most of the time interval, the actual strike decision must be made by the legal authorities and relayed to the pilot and/or weapon within seconds of combat identification of the target.  

The PCES program addresses the following factors that have historically increased software fragility and total ownership costs and imperiled the success of numerous new and planned DoD programs:
1.	Multiple platform and varying operational contexts. DoD systems must invest an ever-increasing proportion of functionality in DRE software to retain technological dominance. Rapidly emerging technologies and flexibility required for diverse operational contexts force deployment of multiple versions of software on various platform architectures, while preserving key properties, such as secure, dependable, and real-time response.  
2.	Total ownership costs. Software development and evolution is labor-intensive and error-prone for complex DoD DRE systems and can represent over 50% of the total ownership costs of these systems.    
3.	Obsolescence trends. Incommensurate lifetimes between DoD systems (20 years or more) and computational platform (2-5 years) lead to pervasive software obsolescence and multiply the total ownership costs by requiring periodic software re-development and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) refresh.    

This BAA solicits proposals in two research categories, "Open Experimentation Platform (OEP) Developer" and "Technology Developer."  Offerors in both categories must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the PCES program with specific challenge problems that must describe the current operational state in the domain of Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter (SDMS/W) systems, and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that would enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP developer will also integrate PCES technologies into the SDMS/W testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs). 

The primary emphasis of this experimental evaluation is the quality (both at design time and at run-time) of the PCES DRE middleware. In that capacity, the OEP developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the PCES DRE middleware and representative SDMS/W applications in terms of their flexibility, correctness, latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, and optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, SDMS/W applications, and the integrated SDMS/W testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the PCES program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category should propose a SDMS/W software test platform of interest to the Armed Services, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate PCES tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the SDMS/W constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for PCES experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that no more than one proposal will be selected in this area for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the SDMS/W testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.	  DRE Middleware Generation and Optimization Tools

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop languages, algorithms, patterns, and code bases to support the generation and optimization of DRE middleware that can be customized for specific mission requirements and constraints of DoD SDMS/W systems and applications. The middleware will be generated automatically and optimized via algorithms that can be tailored declaratively to adapt to key DRE platform characteristics, e.g., interconnection mechanisms, event demultiplexing mechanisms, I/O mechanisms, synchronization and concurrency mechanisms, failure detection and recovery mechanisms, configuration mechanisms, and power levels. Automating the configuration and optimization of DRE middleware is essential since the need for stringent behavioral assurance makes verification and empirical validation of the customized middleware components necessary. Moreover, these capabilities will ensure that DoD systems can leverage standards-based COTS while simultaneously ensuring that key protocol, implementation, and QoS properties can remain unique in order to retain superiority over adversaries who have access to the same standards-based COTS middleware.

Proposers of new DRE middleware generation and optimization tools should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to DRE developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time performance goals, cross-cutting aspects, and/or open middleware standards.  Proposals should discuss the importance and prevalence of these features in the context of DRE middleware and SDMS/W systems.  Proposers should also be able to interface to other PCES components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all DRE middleware generation and optimization tools will be required to be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards PCES is developing and leveraging.  Tools developed for PCES will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other tools and with standards-based middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Any number of different tools may be proposed in a given proposal, though each proposal must comply with all submission requirements including page limits given in this PIP.  Each DRE middleware generation and optimization tool proposed should be structured as a unique, separately priced task option so that a subset of those tools proposed might be targeted for funding. One or more tool options may be targeted for funding from a given proposal, though it is anticipated that no more than four DRE middleware generation and optimization proposals will be selected for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.	Distributed Quality Aspects

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, technology, and tools for applying aspect-oriented techniques to DRE middleware and applications.  In particular, DARPA is seeking innovative techniques that can collect, organize, and disseminate QoS-related meta-information needed to (1) monitor and manage how well the functional interactions occur in SDMS/W systems and (2) enable the decision-making needed to support systemic QoS properties robustly in the face of rapidly changing SDMS/W mission requirements and environmental conditions. These middleware capabilities are crucial to ensure that the aggregate behavior of complex network-centric SDMS/W systems is dependable, despite local failures, transient overloads, and dynamic functional or QoS reconfigurations.

Proposals for distributed quality aspects should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture and the process via which PCES will integrate technologies with it. To promote a common technology base, the interfaces and (where appropriate) the protocols used by PCES middleware should be based on (or should guide) established or emerging industry or DoD standards that are relevant for DoD DRE systems. However, the aspect-oriented technologies developed in the PCES program should also be customizable?statically and dynamically?for specific DoD DRE application and mission requirements. Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG and The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for PCES middleware interoperability. 

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.
 
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than three years in duration. This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA?s release.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Abstract/Proposal, by accessing the URL below:

http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA02/index.asp?BAAid=02-25

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the 
"original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends to submit more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.

Proposers are advised that the Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IXO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/IXO Technical Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  

PROPOSAL FORMAT

Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word 97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-XX, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON Local Time, Thursday, 10/30/02, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-25, Program Composition of Embedded Systems (PCES), will remain open until 12:00 NOON Local Time, Friday, 10/30/03.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, 10/30/03. While the proposals submitted after Thursday, 10/30/02, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.  This Pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/pces/index.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the Pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This Announcement, in conjunction with the BAA 02-25 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

For this BAA, there are two proposal categories, "Technology Developer" and "OEP Developer".  An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category, however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories only. 
Evaluation Criteria for proposals received in the "Technology Developer" category will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
TD Criterion 1.	Innovation and Payoff:  Quality of discussion presented that indicates proposed technology to be developed is innovative.  Quality of discussion that conveys expected design-time and/or run-time improvements relative to current capabilities available commercially or in DoD.   Quality of discussion that describes analytical and/or practical limitations of proposed technology in the context of SDMS/Ws. Quality of discussion that elucidates DARPA's critical role in sponsoring proposed technology.
TD Criterion 2.	Technology Development, and Experimentation Approach:  Quality of analysis presented that elucidates the risks and benefits of proposed technology development approach in the context of SDMS/Ws.  Depth and breadth of understanding of tradeoffs considered in the choice of alternate approaches.  Degree to which presented measures of proposed technology are quantified, sound, and complete.  Quality of discussion that describes feasible experimentation approaches for the technology under development.

<DESC>NA Description:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking Industry input (Sources Sought) for a C4I2TSR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Information Technology, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) contract at Air Force Space Command, Peterson AFB, Colorado to provide engineering and technical support on a wide range of C4I2TSR systems.  The services require the capability to integrate, engineer, furnish equipment and materials, install and test (EFI&T) and provide limite d allied support and operations and maintenance for a wide range of current and future C4I2TSR systems world-wide in support of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), United States Space Command (USSPACECOM), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and other government agencies.  The successful contractor will be selected through the Source Selection procedures.  Selection will be made on the basis of technical abilities, management capabilities, and other factors to be determined.  Since an acquisit ion plan has not yet been approved, a determination has not yet been made as to any potential set-asides.  The contract will potentially be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Award Fee Service Contract with yearly dollar amounts ex pected to range between $5,000,000 and $60,000,000, with a total contract not to exceed $300,000,000.  The anticipated contract will have a minimum guarantee of two percent of the stated maximum for the base period or $500,000, whichever is less, and for a ny option period that is exercised, one percent of the stated maximum or $250,000, whichever is less.  The current acquisition strategy includes a base period with five (5) one-year options. NAICS code is anticipated to be 541512, Computer Systems Design S ervices, with Small Business size standards at $18,000,000.  A DRAFT Scope of work will be available at the Omaha District Website,   http://ebs.nwo.usace.army.mil  on or about 15 February 2002.  A pre-proposal conference and the formal Request for Proposa l will not be available until after approval of the Acquisition Plan, approximately four to five months after Industry Day.  Industry Day will be held at HQ, Space Command, Peterson AFB, CO, Hartinger Building (Building 1) in the main floor auditorium on 6  March 2002, beginning at approximately 0900 (Agenda to be posted on the Omaha District Website as soon as it is completed).   Be prepared to eat lunch at your own expense at any authorized base civilian facility; if you go off base for lunch, it may be di fficult reentering the base.  Prior to Industry Day, the Government requests responses to the following questions;  1. With this acquisition potentially being an IDIQ Cost Plus Award Fee type contracting, would your firm (Small or Large Business) have the financial capability or be able to obtain the financial capability to purchase Materials, or provide other required services prior to invoicing? Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) reviews and approves invoicing, once materials have been purchased and/or work has commenced, prior to submission to the Corps of Engineers  for payment.   2. The contractor will be required to purchase/acquire the equipment and or lab space required by the Scope of Work, approximately $2,500,000, then amortize that cost over the expected five year life of the contract (see Section 3.3.3 in the draft Scope of  Work).   Will this requirement affect your financial capabilities? 3. In the current contract, the government convenes an Award Fee board every six months to determine the award fee the contractor is entitled to. If the contract strategy would change to a 2% Base Fee plus an Award Fee, would that action aid in your obtain ing financial capability? 4. Does your firm currently have the necessary approved purchasing system required for a Cost Plus type contract, to receive an award of such a contract?  If not, how would you perform the contract while meeting the requirements for an approved purchasing system? 5. Because of the anticipated size of this acquisition, would offerors potentially enter into a Joint Venture or other teaming arrangement in order to meet the performance requirements of the solicitation? 6. How long a transition period would industry feel necessary to ensure that it was able to perform the contract and present a seamless transition of contract performance to the Government? 7. Could industry hire adequate workforce at time of award of contract with the knowledge and skills needed to perform the contract?   Would it take an extended period of time (30, 60, 90 days) for hiring of qualified personnel to have them in place and tr ained?  8. Would the Colorado Springs local economy support the manpower requirements with the security clearances necessary to perform a contract of this size over an extended period of time? Minimum security requirement for required  personnel is SECRET.  9. What method of security or mode of protection would industry provide for the Government furnished property that would be transitioned to a newly awarded contractor? Please submit your written comments or concerns on the potential acquisition above, and responses to the specific questions to the address(s) below no later that Close of Business 28 February 2002.  An Industry Day is currently scheduled to discuss this co ntract on 6 March 2002 at Peterson AFB, Colorado.

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) is seeking SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY, (Size standard is 500 or less employees), with expertise in the areas of ultrahigh vacuum (less than 10-9 Torr); grazing-incidence optical systems; thermal stability; vibration isolation; and precision mechanical design.  Interested offerors shall submit capability statements to demonstrate experience and expertise in the aforementioned areas and perform the work described herein.***The NIST, Photon Physics Group, is in the process of upgrading a beamline monochromator that currently resides on the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Source (SURF III) storage ring.***As part of this project, NIST will be replacing the support structure, the mechanical structure, and the vacuum envelope of an extreme ultraviolet (4 nm - 40 nm wavelength) monochromator with the goal of achieving 0.005% reproducibility in wavelength near 13 nm.  The optical components are a toroidal mirror operating at 3 degrees grazing, two plane VLS gratings, and a linearly scanned mirror for wavelength selection.***A description of the design of the present instrument, which will be the basis for the upgraded instrument, can be found in: Nuclear Instruments and Methods, A319, 128-134 (1992).***The gratings are to be on a rotating stage that must have a reproducible positional accuracy of 1 microradian controlled by computer. The gratings are to be interchangeable under vacuum.  Each of the optical components, i.e. the toroidal mirror, the gratings, and the scanning mirror are to maintain precise alignment to within 1 microradian under a 2-degree Centigrade change in the environment and regardless of whether or not the system is under vacuum.***Work will include design of a monochromator that will fit into the existing space, and can achieve the mechanical and thermal stability NIST requires, switch between the two gratings, tweak components while under vacuum, and achieve UHV conditions.  The final chamber must fit within the currently existing beamline.***Information on the Contractor's experience and expertise must be sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition and Logistics Division, Attn: Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 3571, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-3571.  Submission must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on November 27, 2002.
